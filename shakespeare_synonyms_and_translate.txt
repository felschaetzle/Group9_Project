First Citizen:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

All:
Speak, speak.

First Citizen:
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

All:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

First Citizen:
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
Is't a verdict?

All:
No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!

Second Citizen:
One word, good citizens.

First Citizen:
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance; our
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

Second Citizen:
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?

All:
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.

Second Citizen:
Consider you what services he has done for his country?

First Citizen:
Very well; and could be content to give him good
report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.

Second Citizen:
Nay, but speak not maliciously.

First Citizen:
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
is, even till the altitude of his virtue.

Second Citizen:
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.

First Citizen:
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!

All:
Come, come.

First Citizen:
Soft! who comes here?

Second Citizen:
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
the people.

First Citizen:
He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!

MENENIUS:
What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.

First Citizen:
Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
have strong arms too.

MENENIUS:
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
Will you undo yourselves?

First Citizen:
We cannot, sir, we are undone already.

MENENIUS:
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Roman state, whose course will on
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
You are transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you, and you slander
The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
When you curse them as enemies.

First Citizen:
Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich, and provide more
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
there's all the love they bear us.

MENENIUS:
Either you must
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
To stale 't a little more.

First Citizen:
Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
you, deliver.

MENENIUS:
There was a time when all the body's members
Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
That only like a gulf it did remain
I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
And, mutually participate, did minister
Unto the appetite and affection common
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--

First Citizen:
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?

MENENIUS:
Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
For, look you, I may make the belly smile
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as you.

First Citizen:
Your belly's answer? What!
The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
With other muniments and petty helps
In this our fabric, if that they--

MENENIUS:
What then?
'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?

First Citizen:
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
Who is the sink o' the body,--

MENENIUS:
Well, what then?

First Citizen:
The former agents, if they did complain,
What could the belly answer?

MENENIUS:
I will tell you
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.

First Citizen:
Ye're long about it.

MENENIUS:
Note me this, good friend;
Your most grave belly was deliberate,
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
'That I receive the general food at first,
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Because I am the store-house and the shop
Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
I send it through the rivers of your blood,
Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
And, through the cranks and offices of man,
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive that natural competency
Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--

First Citizen:
Ay, sir; well, well.

MENENIUS:
'Though all at once cannot
See what I do deliver out to each,
Yet I can make my audit up, that all
From me do back receive the flour of all,
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?

First Citizen:
It was an answer: how apply you this?

MENENIUS:
The senators of Rome are this good belly,
And you the mutinous members; for examine
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
No public benefit which you receive
But it proceeds or comes from them to you
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
You, the great toe of this assembly?

First Citizen:
I the great toe! why the great toe?

MENENIUS:
For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
Lead'st first to win some vantage.
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
The one side must have bale.
Hail, noble Marcius!

MARCIUS:
Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Make yourselves scabs?

First Citizen:
We have ever your good word.

MARCIUS:
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
And curse that justice did it.
Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate; and your affections are
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
Which would increase his evil. He that depends
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
With every minute you do change a mind,
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble senate, who,
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?

MENENIUS:
For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
The city is well stored.

MARCIUS:
Hang 'em! They say!
They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
Who thrives and who declines; side factions
and give out
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
grain enough!
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
As I could pick my lance.

MENENIUS:
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
For though abundantly they lack discretion,
Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
What says the other troop?

MARCIUS:
They are dissolved: hang 'em!
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
And a petition granted them, a strange one--
To break the heart of generosity,
And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
Shouting their emulation.

MENENIUS:
What is granted them?

MARCIUS:
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
For insurrection's arguing.

MENENIUS:
This is strange.

MARCIUS:
Go, get you home, you fragments!

Messenger:
Where's Caius Marcius?

MARCIUS:
Here: what's the matter?

Messenger:
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS:
I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.

First Senator:
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
The Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS:
They have a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were I any thing but what I am,
I would wish me only he.

COMINIUS:
You have fought together.

MARCIUS:
Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
Only my wars with him: he is a lion
That I am proud to hunt.

First Senator:
Then, worthy Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.

COMINIUS:
It is your former promise.

MARCIUS:
Sir, it is;
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?

TITUS:
No, Caius Marcius;
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
Ere stay behind this business.

MENENIUS:
O, true-bred!

First Senator:
Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
Our greatest friends attend us.

TITUS:

COMINIUS:
Noble Marcius!

First Senator:

MARCIUS:
Nay, let them follow:
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.

SICINIUS:
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

BRUTUS:
He has no equal.

SICINIUS:
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--

BRUTUS:
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?

SICINIUS:
Nay. but his taunts.

BRUTUS:
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.

SICINIUS:
Be-mock the modest moon.

BRUTUS:
The present wars devour him: he is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.

SICINIUS:
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.

BRUTUS:
Fame, at the which he aims,
In whom already he's well graced, can not
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first: for what miscarries
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Had borne the business!'

SICINIUS:
Besides, if things go well,
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius.

BRUTUS:
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
In aught he merit not.

SICINIUS:
Let's hence, and hear
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this present action.

BRUTUS:
Lets along.

First Senator:
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
And know how we proceed.

AUFIDIUS:
Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state,
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this preparation
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Consider of it.'

First Senator:
Our army's in the field
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us.

AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think it folly
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
They needs must show themselves; which
in the hatching,
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot.

Second Senator:
Noble Aufidius,
Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
Let us alone to guard Corioli:
If they set down before 's, for the remove
Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
They've not prepared for us.

AUFIDIUS:
O, doubt not that;
I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

All:
The gods assist you!

AUFIDIUS:
And keep your honours safe!

First Senator:
Farewell.

Second Senator:
Farewell.

All:
Farewell.

VOLUMNIA:
I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
how honour would become such a person. that it was
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.

VIRGILIA:
But had he died in the business, madam; how then?

VOLUMNIA:
Then his good report should have been my son; I
therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
alike and none less dear than thine and my good
Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

Gentlewoman:
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.

VIRGILIA:
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.

VOLUMNIA:
Indeed, you shall not.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Or all or lose his hire.

VIRGILIA:
His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!

VOLUMNIA:
Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
We are fit to bid her welcome.

VIRGILIA:
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

VOLUMNIA:
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
And tread upon his neck.

VALERIA:
My ladies both, good day to you.

VOLUMNIA:
Sweet madam.

VIRGILIA:
I am glad to see your ladyship.

VALERIA:
How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
faith. How does your little son?

VIRGILIA:
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

VOLUMNIA:
He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
look upon his school-master.

VALERIA:
O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
again; and after it again; and over and over he
comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
it!

VOLUMNIA:
One on 's father's moods.

VALERIA:
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

VIRGILIA:
A crack, madam.

VALERIA:
Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play
the idle husewife with me this afternoon.

VIRGILIA:
No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

VALERIA:
Not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA:
She shall, she shall.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
threshold till my lord return from the wars.

VALERIA:
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
you must go visit the good lady that lies in.

VIRGILIA:
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
my prayers; but I cannot go thither.

VOLUMNIA:
Why, I pray you?

VIRGILIA:
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

VALERIA:
You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.

VIRGILIA:
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.

VALERIA:
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
excellent news of your husband.

VIRGILIA:
O, good madam, there can be none yet.

VALERIA:
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
him last night.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, madam?

VALERIA:
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.

VIRGILIA:
Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
thing hereafter.

VOLUMNIA:
Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
disease our better mirth.

VALERIA:
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
solemness out o' door. and go along with us.

VIRGILIA:
No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
you much mirth.

VALERIA:
Well, then, farewell.

MARCIUS:
Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.

LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, no.

MARCIUS:
'Tis done.

LARTIUS:
Agreed.

MARCIUS:
Say, has our general met the enemy?

Messenger:
They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.

LARTIUS:
So, the good horse is mine.

MARCIUS:
I'll buy him of you.

LARTIUS:
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
For half a hundred years. Summon the town.

MARCIUS:
How far off lie these armies?

Messenger:
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS:
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

First Senator:
No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
That's lesser than a little.
Hark! our drums
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
They'll open of themselves.
Hark you. far off!
There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
Amongst your cloven army.

MARCIUS:
O, they are at it!

LARTIUS:
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!

MARCIUS:
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
And he shall feel mine edge.

MARCIUS:
All the contagion of the south light on you,
You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
Further than seen and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches followed.
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.

First Soldier:
Fool-hardiness; not I.

Second Soldier:
Nor I.

First Soldier:
See, they have shut him in.

All:
To the pot, I warrant him.

LARTIUS:
What is become of Marcius?

All:
Slain, sir, doubtless.

First Soldier:
Following the fliers at the very heels,
With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
To answer all the city.

LARTIUS:
O noble fellow!
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
Were feverous and did tremble.

First Soldier:
Look, sir.

LARTIUS:
O,'tis Marcius!
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.

First Roman:
This will I carry to Rome.

Second Roman:
And I this.

Third Roman:
A murrain on't! I took this for silver.

MARCIUS:
See here these movers that do prize their hours
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
Convenient numbers to make good the city;
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.

LARTIUS:
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
Thy exercise hath been too violent for
A second course of fight.

MARCIUS:
Sir, praise me not;
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
I will appear, and fight.

LARTIUS:
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
Prosperity be thy page!

MARCIUS:
Thy friend no less
Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.

LARTIUS:
Thou worthiest Marcius!
Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
Call thither all the officers o' the town,
Where they shall know our mind: away!

COMINIUS:
Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
we are come off
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
That both our powers, with smiling
fronts encountering,
May give you thankful sacrifice.
Thy news?

Messenger:
The citizens of Corioli have issued,
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
And then I came away.

COMINIUS:
Though thou speak'st truth,
Methinks thou speak'st not well.
How long is't since?

Messenger:
Above an hour, my lord.

COMINIUS:
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
And bring thy news so late?

Messenger:
Spies of the Volsces
Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
Half an hour since brought my report.

COMINIUS:
Who's yonder,
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-time seen him thus.

MARCIUS:

COMINIUS:
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
From every meaner man.

MARCIUS:
Come I too late?

COMINIUS:
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in your own.

MARCIUS:
O, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And tapers burn'd to bedward!

COMINIUS:
Flower of warriors,
How is it with Titus Lartius?

MARCIUS:
As with a man busied about decrees:
Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To let him slip at will.

COMINIUS:
Where is that slave
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
Where is he? call him hither.

MARCIUS:
Let him alone;
He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
From rascals worse than they.

COMINIUS:
But how prevail'd you?

MARCIUS:
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
If not, why cease you till you are so?

COMINIUS:
Marcius,
We have at disadvantage fought and did
Retire to win our purpose.

MARCIUS:
How lies their battle? know you on which side
They have placed their men of trust?

COMINIUS:
As I guess, Marcius,
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope.

MARCIUS:
I do beseech you,
By all the battles wherein we have fought,
By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
We have made to endure friends, that you directly
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
And that you not delay the present, but,
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
We prove this very hour.

COMINIUS:
Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your choice of those
That best can aid your action.

MARCIUS:
Those are they
That most are willing. If any such be here--
As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Lesser his person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
And that his country's dearer than himself;
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus, to express his disposition,
And follow Marcius.
O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which of you
But is four Volsces? none of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
Though thanks to all, must I select
from all: the rest
Shall bear the business in some other fight,
As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
And four shall quickly draw out my command,
Which men are best inclined.

COMINIUS:
March on, my fellows:
Make good this ostentation, and you shall
Divide in all with us.

LARTIUS:
So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
For a short holding: if we lose the field,
We cannot keep the town.

Lieutenant:
Fear not our care, sir.

LARTIUS:
Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.

MARCIUS:
I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
Worse than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS:
We hate alike:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

MARCIUS:
Let the first budger die the other's slave,
And the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS:
If I fly, Marcius,
Holloa me like a hare.

MARCIUS:
Within these three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to the highest.

AUFIDIUS:
Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
Thou shouldst not scape me here.
Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
In your condemned seconds.

COMINIUS:
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
dull tribunes,
That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
Having fully dined before.

LARTIUS:
O general,
Here is the steed, we the caparison:
Hadst thou beheld--

MARCIUS:
Pray now, no more: my mother,
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
As you have done; that's what I can; induced
As you have been; that's for my country:
He that has but effected his good will
Hath overta'en mine act.

COMINIUS:
You shall not be
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
To hide your doings; and to silence that,
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
In sign of what you are, not to reward
What you have done--before our army hear me.

MARCIUS:
I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
To hear themselves remember'd.

COMINIUS:
Should they not,
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
The treasure in this field achieved and city,
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the common distribution, at
Your only choice.

MARCIUS:
I thank you, general;
But cannot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
And stand upon my common part with those
That have beheld the doing.

MARCIUS:
May these same instruments, which you profane,
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
Made all of false-faced soothing!
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
You shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical;
As if I loved my little should be dieted
In praises sauced with lies.

COMINIUS:
Too modest are you;
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly: by your patience,
If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
For what he did before Corioli, call him,
With all the applause and clamour of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
The addition nobly ever!

All:
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
I will go wash;
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To undercrest your good addition
To the fairness of my power.

COMINIUS:
So, to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
The best, with whom we may articulate,
For their own good and ours.

LARTIUS:
I shall, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Of my lord general.

COMINIUS:
Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?

CORIOLANUS:
I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was within my view,
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
To give my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS:
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

LARTIUS:
Marcius, his name?

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?

COMINIUS:
Go we to our tent:
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
It should be look'd to: come.

AUFIDIUS:
The town is ta'en!

First Soldier:
'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.

AUFIDIUS:
Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
What good condition can a treaty find
I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
As often as we eat. By the elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
Or wrath or craft may get him.

First Soldier:
He's the devil.

AUFIDIUS:
Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
With only suffering stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.

First Soldier:
Will not you go?

AUFIDIUS:
I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey.

First Soldier:
I shall, sir.

MENENIUS:
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.

BRUTUS:
Good or bad?

MENENIUS:
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
love not Marcius.

SICINIUS:
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, who does the wolf love?

SICINIUS:
The lamb.

MENENIUS:
Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
noble Marcius.

BRUTUS:
He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.

MENENIUS:
He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.

Both:
Well, sir.

MENENIUS:
In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
have not in abundance?

BRUTUS:
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.

SICINIUS:
Especially in pride.

BRUTUS:
And topping all others in boasting.

MENENIUS:
This is strange now: do you two know how you are
censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the
right-hand file? do you?

Both:
Why, how are we censured?

MENENIUS:
Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?

Both:
Well, well, sir, well.

MENENIUS:
Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
being proud?

BRUTUS:
We do it not alone, sir.

MENENIUS:
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
single: your abilities are too infant-like for
doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
O that you could!

BRUTUS:
What then, sir?

MENENIUS:
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
any in Rome.

SICINIUS:
Menenius, you are known well enough too.

MENENIUS:
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
compound with the major part of your syllables: and
though I must be content to bear with those that say
you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
well enough too? what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
known well enough too?

BRUTUS:
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

MENENIUS:
You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience. When you are hearing a
matter between party and party, if you chance to be
pinched with the colic, you make faces like
mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
a pair of strange ones.

BRUTUS:
Come, come, you are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol.

MENENIUS:
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
your worships: more of your conversation would
infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
your eyes so fast?

VOLUMNIA:
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
the love of Juno, let's go.

MENENIUS:
Ha! Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
approbation.

MENENIUS:
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
Nay,'tis true.

VOLUMNIA:
Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
at home for you.

MENENIUS:
I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
me!

VIRGILIA:
Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.

MENENIUS:
A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.

VIRGILIA:
O, no, no, no.

VOLUMNIA:
O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.

MENENIUS:
So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.

VOLUMNIA:
On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
with the oaken garland.

MENENIUS:
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA:
Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
Aufidius got off.

MENENIUS:
And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?

VOLUMNIA:
Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
action outdone his former deeds doubly

VALERIA:
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.

MENENIUS:
Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
true purchasing.

VIRGILIA:
The gods grant them true!

VOLUMNIA:
True! pow, wow.

MENENIUS:
True! I'll be sworn they are true.
Where is he wounded?
God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?

VOLUMNIA:
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.

MENENIUS:
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
nine that I know.

VOLUMNIA:
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
wounds upon him.

MENENIUS:
Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
Hark! the trumpets.

VOLUMNIA:
These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.

Herald:
Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
In honour follows Coriolanus.
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

All:
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now, no more.

COMINIUS:
Look, sir, your mother!

CORIOLANUS:
O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
For my prosperity!

VOLUMNIA:
Nay, my good soldier, up;
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
But O, thy wife!

CORIOLANUS:
My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
And mothers that lack sons.

MENENIUS:
Now, the gods crown thee!

CORIOLANUS:
And live you yet?
O my sweet lady, pardon.

VOLUMNIA:
I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.

MENENIUS:
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
A curse begin at very root on's heart,
That is not glad to see thee! You are three
That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
We have some old crab-trees here
at home that will not
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
We call a nettle but a nettle and
The faults of fools but folly.

COMINIUS:
Ever right.

CORIOLANUS:
Menenius ever, ever.

Herald:
Give way there, and go on!

CORIOLANUS:

VOLUMNIA:
I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy: only
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way,
Than sway with them in theirs.

COMINIUS:
On, to the Capitol!

BRUTUS:
All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slily crept into his human powers
And gave him graceful posture.

SICINIUS:
On the sudden,
I warrant him consul.

BRUTUS:
Then our office may,
During his power, go sleep.

SICINIUS:
He cannot temperately transport his honours
From where he should begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath won.

BRUTUS:
In that there's comfort.

SICINIUS:
Doubt not
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honours, which
That he will give them make I as little question
As he is proud to do't.

BRUTUS:
I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To the people, beg their stinking breaths.

SICINIUS:
'Tis right.

BRUTUS:
It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
And the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS:
I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
In execution.

BRUTUS:
'Tis most like he will.

SICINIUS:
It shall be to him then as our good wills,
A sure destruction.

BRUTUS:
So it must fall out
To him or our authorities. For an end,
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
In human action and capacity,
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in the war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.

SICINIUS:
This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever.

BRUTUS:
What's the matter?

Messenger:
You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
That Marcius shall be consul:
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
I never saw the like.

BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol;
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
But hearts for the event.

SICINIUS:
Have with you.

First Officer:
Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
for consulships?

Second Officer:
Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
Coriolanus will carry it.

First Officer:
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
loves not the common people.

Second Officer:
Faith, there had been many great men that have
flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
be many that they have loved, they know not
wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly see't.

First Officer:
If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than can render it him; and leaves
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
dislikes, to flatter them for their love.

Second Officer:
He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
having been supple and courteous to the people,
bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.

First Officer:
No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
are coming.

MENENIUS:
Having determined of the Volsces and
To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
As the main point of this our after-meeting,
To gratify his noble service that
Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
please you,
Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
The present consul, and last general
In our well-found successes, to report
A little of that worthy work perform'd
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
We met here both to thank and to remember
With honours like himself.

First Senator:
Speak, good Cominius:
Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
Rather our state's defective for requital
Than we to stretch it out.
Masters o' the people,
We do request your kindest ears, and after,
Your loving motion toward the common body,
To yield what passes here.

SICINIUS:
We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
Inclinable to honour and advance
The theme of our assembly.

BRUTUS:
Which the rather
We shall be blest to do, if he remember
A kinder value of the people than
He hath hereto prized them at.

MENENIUS:
That's off, that's off;
I would you rather had been silent. Please you
To hear Cominius speak?

BRUTUS:
Most willingly;
But yet my caution was more pertinent
Than the rebuke you give it.

MENENIUS:
He loves your people
But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep your place.

First Senator:
Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
What you have nobly done.

CORIOLANUS:
Your horror's pardon:
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.

BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not.

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir: yet oft,
When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
your people,
I love them as they weigh.

MENENIUS:
Pray now, sit down.

CORIOLANUS:
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monster'd.

MENENIUS:
Masters of the people,
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
The man I speak of cannot in the world
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
When he might act the woman in the scene,
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
Before and in Corioli, let me say,
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
And to the battle came he; where he did
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
Both field and city ours, he never stood
To ease his breast with panting.

MENENIUS:
Worthy man!

First Senator:
He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him.

COMINIUS:
Our spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd upon things precious as they were
The common muck of the world: he covets less
Than misery itself would give; rewards
His deeds with doing them, and is content
To spend the time to end it.

MENENIUS:
He's right noble:
Let him be call'd for.

First Senator:
Call Coriolanus.

Officer:
He doth appear.

MENENIUS:
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
To make thee consul.

CORIOLANUS:
I do owe them still
My life and services.

MENENIUS:
It then remains
That you do speak to the people.

CORIOLANUS:
I do beseech you,
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
That I may pass this doing.

SICINIUS:
Sir, the people
Must have their voices; neither will they bate
One jot of ceremony.

MENENIUS:
Put them not to't:
Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
Take to you, as your predecessors have,
Your honour with your form.

CORIOLANUS:
It is apart
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the people.

BRUTUS:
Mark you that?

CORIOLANUS:
To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
As if I had received them for the hire
Of their breath only!

MENENIUS:
Do not stand upon't.
We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
Wish we all joy and honour.

Senators:
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!

BRUTUS:
You see how he intends to use the people.

SICINIUS:
May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
As if he did contemn what he requested
Should be in them to give.

BRUTUS:
Come, we'll inform them
Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
I know, they do attend us.

First Citizen:
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.

Second Citizen:
We may, sir, if we will.

Third Citizen:
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
monstrous members.

First Citizen:
And to make us no better thought of, a little help
will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.

Third Citizen:
We have been called so of many; not that our heads
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
and their consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the points o' the compass.

Second Citizen:
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
fly?

Third Citizen:
Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.

Second Citizen:
Why that way?

Third Citizen:
To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.

Second Citizen:
You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.

Third Citizen:
Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
say, if he would incline to the people, there was
never a worthier man.
Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
by threes. He's to make his requests by
particulars; wherein every one of us has a single
honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
you shall go by him.

All:
Content, content.

MENENIUS:
O sir, you are not right: have you not known
The worthiest men have done't?

CORIOLANUS:
What must I say?
'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
I got them in my country's service, when
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
From the noise of our own drums.'

MENENIUS:
O me, the gods!
You must not speak of that: you must desire them
To think upon you.

CORIOLANUS:
Think upon me! hang 'em!
I would they would forget me, like the virtues
Which our divines lose by 'em.

MENENIUS:
You'll mar all:
I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
In wholesome manner.

CORIOLANUS:
Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean.
So, here comes a brace.
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.

Third Citizen:
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.

CORIOLANUS:
Mine own desert.

Second Citizen:
Your own desert!

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, but not mine own desire.

Third Citizen:
How not your own desire?

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
poor with begging.

Third Citizen:
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
gain by you.

CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?

First Citizen:
The price is to ask it kindly.

CORIOLANUS:
Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
good voice, sir; what say you?

Second Citizen:
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS:
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
begged. I have your alms: adieu.

Third Citizen:
But this is something odd.

Second Citizen:
An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that I may be consul, I have here the
customary gown.

Fourth Citizen:
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
have not deserved nobly.

CORIOLANUS:
Your enigma?

Fourth Citizen:
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
the common people.

CORIOLANUS:
You should account me the more virtuous that I have
not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
I may be consul.

Fifth Citizen:
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
you our voices heartily.

Fourth Citizen:
You have received many wounds for your country.

CORIOLANUS:
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.

Both Citizens:
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!

CORIOLANUS:
Most sweet voices!
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
And mountainous error be too highly heapt
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
Let the high office and the honour go
To one that would do thus. I am half through;
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
Here come more voices.
Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
Indeed I would be consul.

Sixth Citizen:
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
man's voice.

Seventh Citizen:
Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
and make him good friend to the people!

All Citizens:
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!

CORIOLANUS:
Worthy voices!

MENENIUS:
You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
Endue you with the people's voice: remains
That, in the official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the senate.

CORIOLANUS:
Is this done?

SICINIUS:
The custom of request you have discharged:
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.

CORIOLANUS:
Where? at the senate-house?

SICINIUS:
There, Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS:
May I change these garments?

SICINIUS:
You may, sir.

CORIOLANUS:
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the senate-house.

MENENIUS:
I'll keep you company. Will you along?

BRUTUS:
We stay here for the people.

SICINIUS:
Fare you well.
He has it now, and by his looks methink
'Tis warm at 's heart.

BRUTUS:
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
will you dismiss the people?

SICINIUS:
How now, my masters! have you chose this man?

First Citizen:
He has our voices, sir.

BRUTUS:
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

Second Citizen:
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

Third Citizen:
Certainly
He flouted us downright.

First Citizen:
No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.

Second Citizen:
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.

SICINIUS:
Why, so he did, I am sure.

Citizens:
No, no; no man saw 'em.

Third Citizen:
He said he had wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
But by your voices, will not so permit me;
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
Your most sweet voices: now you have left
your voices,
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS:
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices?

BRUTUS:
Could you not have told him
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy, ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friendly lord.

SICINIUS:
Thus to have said,
As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
And pass'd him unelected.

BRUTUS:
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves, and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment?

SICINIUS:
Have you
Ere now denied the asker? and now again
Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
Your sued-for tongues?

Third Citizen:
He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.

Second Citizen:
And will deny him:
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.

First Citizen:
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.

BRUTUS:
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties; make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS:
Let them assemble,
And on a safer judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took from you
The apprehension of his present portance,
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS:
Lay
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him.

SICINIUS:
Say, you chose him
More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections, and that your minds,
Preoccupied with what you rather must do
Than what you should, made you against the grain
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS:
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
How youngly he began to serve his country,
How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
And  
Twice being  
Was his great ancestor.

SICINIUS:
One thus descended,
That hath beside well in his person wrought
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrances: but you have found,
Scaling his present bearing with his past,
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your sudden approbation.

BRUTUS:
Say, you ne'er had done't--
Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to the Capitol.

All:
We will so: almost all
Repent in their election.

BRUTUS:
Let them go on;
This mutiny were better put in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
With their refusal, both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger.

SICINIUS:
To the Capitol, come:
We will be there before the stream o' the people;
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
Which we have goaded onward.

CORIOLANUS:
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

LARTIUS:
He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
Our swifter composition.

CORIOLANUS:
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
Upon's again.

COMINIUS:
They are worn, lord consul, so,
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again.

CORIOLANUS:
Saw you Aufidius?

LARTIUS:
On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS:
He did, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
How? what?

LARTIUS:
How often he had met you, sword to sword;
That of all things upon the earth he hated
Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
To hopeless restitution, so he might
Be call'd your vanquisher.

CORIOLANUS:
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS:
At Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
For they do prank them in authority,
Against all noble sufferance.

SICINIUS:
Pass no further.

CORIOLANUS:
Ha! what is that?

BRUTUS:
It will be dangerous to go on: no further.

CORIOLANUS:
What makes this change?

MENENIUS:
The matter?

COMINIUS:
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

BRUTUS:
Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS:
Have I had children's voices?

First Senator:
Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.

BRUTUS:
The people are incensed against him.

SICINIUS:
Stop,
Or all will fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS:
Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
your offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?

MENENIUS:
Be calm, be calm.

CORIOLANUS:
It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
To curb the will of the nobility:
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be ruled.

BRUTUS:
Call't not a plot:
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS:
Why, this was known before.

BRUTUS:
Not to them all.

CORIOLANUS:
Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS:
How! I inform them!

CORIOLANUS:
You are like to do such business.

BRUTUS:
Not unlike,
Each way, to better yours.

CORIOLANUS:
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Your fellow tribune.

SICINIUS:
You show too much of that
For which the people stir: if you will pass
To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Or never be so noble as a consul,
Nor yoke with him for tribune.

MENENIUS:
Let's be calm.

COMINIUS:
The people are abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
I' the plain way of his merit.

CORIOLANUS:
Tell me of corn!
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--

MENENIUS:
Not now, not now.

First Senator:
Not in this heat, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS:
Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
I crave their pardons:
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
Therein behold themselves: I say again,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
and scatter'd,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Which they have given to beggars.

MENENIUS:
Well, no more.

First Senator:
No more words, we beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
How! no more!
As for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles,
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
The very way to catch them.

BRUTUS:
You speak o' the people,
As if you were a god to punish, not
A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS:
'Twere well
We let the people know't.

MENENIUS:
What, what? his choler?

CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

SICINIUS:
It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further.

CORIOLANUS:
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
His absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS:
'Twas from the canon.

CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If he have power
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
If they be senators: and they are no less,
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
To know, when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by the other.

COMINIUS:
Well, on to the market-place.

CORIOLANUS:
Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in Greece,--

MENENIUS:
Well, well, no more of that.

CORIOLANUS:
Though there the people had more absolute power,
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state.

BRUTUS:
Why, shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?

CORIOLANUS:
I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
Which they have often made against the senate,
All cause unborn, could never be the motive
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
How shall this bisson multitude digest
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.

MENENIUS:
Come, enough.

BRUTUS:
Enough, with over-measure.

CORIOLANUS:
No, take more:
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of general ignorance,--it must omit
Real necessities, and give way the while
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
it follows,
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
That love the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
A noble life before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become't,
Not having the power to do the good it would,
For the in which doth control't.

BRUTUS:
Has said enough.

SICINIUS:
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
As traitors do.

CORIOLANUS:
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
On whom depending, their obedience fails
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
And throw their power i' the dust.

BRUTUS:
Manifest treason!

SICINIUS:
This a consul? no.

BRUTUS:
The aediles, ho!
Let him be apprehended.

SICINIUS:
Go, call the people:
in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
And follow to thine answer.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, old goat!

Senators, &C:
We'll surety him.

COMINIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments.

SICINIUS:
Help, ye citizens!

MENENIUS:
On both sides more respect.

SICINIUS:
Here's he that would take from you all your power.

BRUTUS:
Seize him, AEdiles!

Citizens:
Down with him! down with him!

Senators, &C:
Weapons, weapons, weapons!
'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'

MENENIUS:
What is about to be? I am out of breath;
Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius.

SICINIUS:
Hear me, people; peace!

Citizens:
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.

SICINIUS:
You are at point to lose your liberties:
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
Whom late you have named for consul.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

First Senator:
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.

SICINIUS:
What is the city but the people?

Citizens:
True,
The people are the city.

BRUTUS:
By the consent of all, we were establish'd
The people's magistrates.

Citizens:
You so remain.

MENENIUS:
And so are like to do.

COMINIUS:
That is the way to lay the city flat;
To bring the roof to the foundation,
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
In heaps and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS:
This deserves death.

BRUTUS:
Or let us stand to our authority,
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
Of present death.

SICINIUS:
Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
Into destruction cast him.

BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens:
Yield, Marcius, yield!

MENENIUS:
Hear me one word;
Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.

AEdile:
Peace, peace!

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
Sir, those cold ways,
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
And bear him to the rock.

CORIOLANUS:
No, I'll die here.
There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.

MENENIUS:
Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

BRUTUS:
Lay hands upon him.

COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You that be noble; help him, young and old!

Citizens:
Down with him, down with him!

MENENIUS:
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else.

Second Senator:
Get you gone.

COMINIUS:
Stand fast;
We have as many friends as enemies.

MENENIUS:
Sham it be put to that?

First Senator:
The gods forbid!
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
Leave us to cure this cause.

MENENIUS:
For 'tis a sore upon us,
You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.

COMINIUS:
Come, sir, along with us.

CORIOLANUS:
I would they were barbarians--as they are,
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--

MENENIUS:
Be gone;
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
One time will owe another.

CORIOLANUS:
On fair ground
I could beat forty of them.

COMINIUS:
I could myself
Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
two tribunes:
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
What they are used to bear.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, be gone:
I'll try whether my old wit be in request
With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
With cloth of any colour.

COMINIUS:
Nay, come away.

A Patrician:
This man has marr'd his fortune.

MENENIUS:
His nature is too noble for the world:
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
And, being angry, does forget that ever
He heard the name of death.
Here's goodly work!

Second Patrician:
I would they were abed!

MENENIUS:
I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
Could he not speak 'em fair?

SICINIUS:
Where is this viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself?

MENENIUS:
You worthy tribunes,--

SICINIUS:
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public power
Which he so sets at nought.

First Citizen:
He shall well know
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
And we their hands.

Citizens:
He shall, sure on't.

MENENIUS:
Sir, sir,--

SICINIUS:
Peace!

MENENIUS:
Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
With modest warrant.

SICINIUS:
Sir, how comes't that you
Have holp to make this rescue?

MENENIUS:
Hear me speak:
As I do know the consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults,--

SICINIUS:
Consul! what consul?

MENENIUS:
The consul Coriolanus.

BRUTUS:
He consul!

Citizens:
No, no, no, no, no.

MENENIUS:
If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
The which shall turn you to no further harm
Than so much loss of time.

SICINIUS:
Speak briefly then;
For we are peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
Were but one danger, and to keep him here
Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
He dies to-night.

MENENIUS:
Now the good gods forbid
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own!

SICINIUS:
He's a disease that must be cut away.

MENENIUS:
O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
And what is left, to lose it by his country,
Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
A brand to the end o' the world.

SICINIUS:
This is clean kam.

BRUTUS:
Merely awry: when he did love his country,
It honour'd him.

MENENIUS:
The service of the foot
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
For what before it was.

BRUTUS:
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
Spread further.

MENENIUS:
One word more, one word.
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
And sack great Rome with Romans.

BRUTUS:
If it were so,--

SICINIUS:
What do ye talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.

MENENIUS:
Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
In bolted language; meal and bran together
He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
In peace, to his utmost peril.

First Senator:
Noble tribunes,
It is the humane way: the other course
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
Unknown to the beginning.

SICINIUS:
Noble Menenius,
Be you then as the people's officer.
Masters, lay down your weapons.

BRUTUS:
Go not home.

SICINIUS:
Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
In our first way.

MENENIUS:
I'll bring him to you.
Let me desire your company: he must come,
Or what is worst will follow.

First Senator:
Pray you, let's to him.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
Be thus to them.

A Patrician:
You do the nobler.

CORIOLANUS:
I muse my mother
Does not approve me further, who was wont
To call them woollen vassals, things created
To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
When one but of my ordinance stood up
To speak of peace or war.
I talk of you:
Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
False to my nature? Rather say I play
The man I am.

VOLUMNIA:
O, sir, sir, sir,
I would have had you put your power well on,
Before you had worn it out.

CORIOLANUS:
Let go.

VOLUMNIA:
You might have been enough the man you are,
With striving less to be so; lesser had been
The thwartings of your dispositions, if
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
Ere they lack'd power to cross you.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them hang.

A Patrician:
Ay, and burn too.

MENENIUS:
Come, come, you have been too rough, something
too rough;
You must return and mend it.

First Senator:
There's no remedy;
Unless, by not so doing, our good city
Cleave in the midst, and perish.

VOLUMNIA:
Pray, be counsell'd:
I have a heart as little apt as yours,
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
To better vantage.

MENENIUS:
Well said, noble woman?
Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
Which I can scarcely bear.

CORIOLANUS:
What must I do?

MENENIUS:
Return to the tribunes.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, what then? what then?

MENENIUS:
Repent what you have spoke.

CORIOLANUS:
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?

VOLUMNIA:
You are too absolute;
Though therein you can never be too noble,
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
In peace what each of them by the other lose,
That they combine not there.

CORIOLANUS:
Tush, tush!

MENENIUS:
A good demand.

VOLUMNIA:
If it be honour in your wars to seem
The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
That it shall hold companionship in peace
With honour, as in war, since that to both
It stands in like request?

CORIOLANUS:
Why force you this?

VOLUMNIA:
Because that now it lies you on to speak
To the people; not by your own instruction,
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
But with such words that are but rooted in
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
Now, this no more dishonours you at all
Than to take in a town with gentle words,
Which else would put you to your fortune and
The hazard of much blood.
I would dissemble with my nature where
My fortunes and my friends at stake required
I should do so in honour: I am in this,
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
And you will rather show our general louts
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
Of what that want might ruin.

MENENIUS:
Noble lady!
Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
Of what is past.

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, my son,
Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
As thou hast power and person.

MENENIUS:
This but done,
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
As words to little purpose.

VOLUMNIA:
Prithee now,
Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
You make strong party, or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.

MENENIUS:
Only fair speech.

COMINIUS:
I think 'twill serve, if he
Can thereto frame his spirit.

VOLUMNIA:
He must, and will
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

CORIOLANUS:
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
You have put me now to such a part which never
I shall discharge to the life.

COMINIUS:
Come, come, we'll prompt you.

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
To have my praise for this, perform a part
Thou hast not done before.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, I must do't:
Away, my disposition, and possess me
Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
And by my body's action teach my mind
A most inherent baseness.

VOLUMNIA:
At thy choice, then:
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
But owe thy pride thyself.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray, be content:
Mother, I am going to the market-place;
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
I' the way of flattery further.

VOLUMNIA:
Do your will.

COMINIUS:
Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
To answer mildly; for they are prepared
With accusations, as I hear, more strong
Than are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS:
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
Let them accuse me by invention, I
Will answer in mine honour.

MENENIUS:
Ay, but mildly.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!

BRUTUS:
In this point charge him home, that he affects
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
Enforce him with his envy to the people,
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
Was ne'er distributed.
What, will he come?

AEdile:
He's coming.

BRUTUS:
How accompanied?

AEdile:
With old Menenius, and those senators
That always favour'd him.

SICINIUS:
Have you a catalogue
Of all the voices that we have procured
Set down by the poll?

AEdile:
I have; 'tis ready.

SICINIUS:
Have you collected them by tribes?

AEdile:
I have.

SICINIUS:
Assemble presently the people hither;
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the old prerogative
And power i' the truth o' the cause.

AEdile:
I shall inform them.

BRUTUS:
And when such time they have begun to cry,
Let them not cease, but with a din confused
Enforce the present execution
Of what we chance to sentence.

AEdile:
Very well.

SICINIUS:
Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
When we shall hap to give 't them.

BRUTUS:
Go about it.
Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
With us to break his neck.

SICINIUS:
Well, here he comes.

MENENIUS:
Calmly, I do beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
And not our streets with war!

First Senator:
Amen, amen.

MENENIUS:
A noble wish.

SICINIUS:
Draw near, ye people.

AEdile:
List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!

CORIOLANUS:
First, hear me speak.

Both Tribunes:
Well, say. Peace, ho!

CORIOLANUS:
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?

SICINIUS:
I do demand,
If you submit you to the people's voices,
Allow their officers and are content
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
As shall be proved upon you?

CORIOLANUS:
I am content.

MENENIUS:
Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
The warlike service he has done, consider; think
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
Like graves i' the holy churchyard.

CORIOLANUS:
Scratches with briers,
Scars to move laughter only.

MENENIUS:
Consider further,
That when he speaks not like a citizen,
You find him like a soldier: do not take
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
Rather than envy you.

COMINIUS:
Well, well, no more.

CORIOLANUS:
What is the matter
That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
You take it off again?

SICINIUS:
Answer to us.

CORIOLANUS:
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.

SICINIUS:
We charge you, that you have contrived to take
From Rome all season'd office and to wind
Yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which you are a traitor to the people.

CORIOLANUS:
How! traitor!

MENENIUS:
Nay, temperately; your promise.

CORIOLANUS:
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
As I do pray the gods.

SICINIUS:
Mark you this, people?

Citizens:
To the rock, to the rock with him!

SICINIUS:
Peace!
We need not put new matter to his charge:
What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
Those whose great power must try him; even this,
So criminal and in such capital kind,
Deserves the extremest death.

BRUTUS:
But since he hath
Served well for Rome,--

CORIOLANUS:
What do you prate of service?

BRUTUS:
I talk of that, that know it.

CORIOLANUS:
You?

MENENIUS:
Is this the promise that you made your mother?

COMINIUS:
Know, I pray you,--

CORIOLANUS:
I know no further:
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

SICINIUS:
For that he has,
As much as in him lies, from time to time
Envied against the people, seeking means
To pluck away their power, as now at last
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
Even from this instant, banish him our city,
In peril of precipitation
From off the rock Tarpeian never more
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
I say it shall be so.

Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.

COMINIUS:
Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--

SICINIUS:
He's sentenced; no more hearing.

COMINIUS:
Let me speak:
I have been consul, and can show for Rome
Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
My country's good with a respect more tender,
More holy and profound, than mine own life,
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
And treasure of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,--

SICINIUS:
We know your drift: speak what?

BRUTUS:
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
As enemy to the people and his country:
It shall be so.

Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so.

CORIOLANUS:
You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
And here remain with your uncertainty!
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
Fan you into despair! Have the power still
To banish your defenders; till at length
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
Making not reservation of yourselves,
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
Abated captives to some nation
That won you without blows! Despising,
For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
There is a world elsewhere.

AEdile:
The people's enemy is gone, is gone!

Citizens:
Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!

SICINIUS:
Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
As he hath followed you, with all despite;
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
Attend us through the city.

Citizens:
Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.

CORIOLANUS:
Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
Where is your ancient courage? you were used
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
That common chances common men could bear;
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
A noble cunning: you were used to load me
With precepts that would make invincible
The heart that conn'd them.

VIRGILIA:
O heavens! O heavens!

CORIOLANUS:
Nay! prithee, woman,--

VOLUMNIA:
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
And occupations perish!

CORIOLANUS:
What, what, what!
I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
If you had been the wife of Hercules,
Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
My hazards still have been your solace: and
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
Will or exceed the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practise.

VOLUMNIA:
My first son.
Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
With thee awhile: determine on some course,
More than a wild exposture to each chance
That starts i' the way before thee.

CORIOLANUS:
O the gods!

COMINIUS:
I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
I' the absence of the needer.

CORIOLANUS:
Fare ye well:
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
While I remain above the ground, you shall
Hear from me still, and never of me aught
But what is like me formerly.

MENENIUS:
That's worthily
As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
If I could shake off but one seven years
From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
I'ld with thee every foot.

CORIOLANUS:
Give me thy hand: Come.

SICINIUS:
Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
In his behalf.

BRUTUS:
Now we have shown our power,
Let us seem humbler after it is done
Than when it was a-doing.

SICINIUS:
Bid them home:
Say their great enemy is gone, and they
Stand in their ancient strength.

BRUTUS:
Dismiss them home.
Here comes his mother.

SICINIUS:
Let's not meet her.

BRUTUS:
Why?

SICINIUS:
They say she's mad.

BRUTUS:
They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.

VOLUMNIA:
O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
Requite your love!

MENENIUS:
Peace, peace; be not so loud.

VOLUMNIA:
If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
Nay, and you shall hear some.
Will you be gone?

VIRGILIA:

SICINIUS:
Are you mankind?

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
Than thou hast spoken words?

SICINIUS:
O blessed heavens!

VOLUMNIA:
More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
His good sword in his hand.

SICINIUS:
What then?

VIRGILIA:
What then!
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.

VOLUMNIA:
Bastards and all.
Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!

MENENIUS:
Come, come, peace.

SICINIUS:
I would he had continued to his country
As he began, and not unknit himself
The noble knot he made.

BRUTUS:
I would he had.

VOLUMNIA:
'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
As I can of those mysteries which heaven
Will not have earth to know.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us go.

VOLUMNIA:
Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
As far as doth the Capitol exceed
The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--
This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.

BRUTUS:
Well, well, we'll leave you.

SICINIUS:
Why stay we to be baited
With one that wants her wits?

VOLUMNIA:
Take my prayers with you.
I would the gods had nothing else to do
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
Of what lies heavy to't.

MENENIUS:
You have told them home;
And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?

VOLUMNIA:
Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!

Roman:
I know you well, sir, and you know
me: your name, I think, is Adrian.

Volsce:
It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.

Roman:
I am a Roman; and my services are,
as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?

Volsce:
Nicanor? no.

Roman:
The same, sir.

Volsce:
You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
to find you out there: you have well saved me a
day's journey.

Roman:
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.

Volsce:
Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.

Roman:
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
so to heart the banishment of that worthy
Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the people and to pluck from them
their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
breaking out.

Volsce:
Coriolanus banished!

Roman:
Banished, sir.

Volsce:
You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.

Roman:
The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
of his country.

Volsce:
He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
business, and I will merrily accompany you home.

Roman:
I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?

Volsce:
A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
and to be on foot at an hour's warning.

Roman:
I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.

Volsce:
You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
to be glad of yours.

Roman:
Well, let us go together.

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly city is this Antium. City,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
In puny battle slay me.
Save you, sir.

Citizen:
And you.

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be your will,
Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen:
He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
At his house this night.

CORIOLANUS:
Which is his house, beseech you?

Citizen:
This, here before you.

CORIOLANUS:
Thank you, sir: farewell.
O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
Unseparable, shall within this hour,
On a dissension of a doit, break out
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
To take the one the other, by some chance,
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
He does fair justice; if he give me way,
I'll do his country service.

First Servingman:
Wine, wine, wine! What service
is here! I think our fellows are asleep.

Second Servingman:
Where's Cotus? my master calls
for him. Cotus!

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
Appear not like a guest.

First Servingman:
What would you have, friend? whence are you?
Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.

CORIOLANUS:
I have deserved no better entertainment,
In being Coriolanus.

Second Servingman:
Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
Pray, get you out.

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

Second Servingman:
Away! get you away.

CORIOLANUS:
Now thou'rt troublesome.

Second Servingman:
Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.

Third Servingman:
What fellow's this?

First Servingman:
A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.

Third Servingman:
What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
the house.

CORIOLANUS:
Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.

Third Servingman:
What are you?

CORIOLANUS:
A gentleman.

Third Servingman:
A marvellous poor one.

CORIOLANUS:
True, so I am.

Third Servingman:
Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.

CORIOLANUS:
Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.

Third Servingman:
What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
strange guest he has here.

Second Servingman:
And I shall.

Third Servingman:
Where dwellest thou?

CORIOLANUS:
Under the canopy.

Third Servingman:
Under the canopy!

CORIOLANUS:
Ay.

Third Servingman:
Where's that?

CORIOLANUS:
I' the city of kites and crows.

Third Servingman:
I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
Then thou dwellest with daws too?

CORIOLANUS:
No, I serve not thy master.

Third Servingman:
How, sir! do you meddle with my master?

CORIOLANUS:
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
trencher, hence!

AUFIDIUS:
Where is this fellow?

Second Servingman:
Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
disturbing the lords within.

AUFIDIUS:
Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
If, Tullus,
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Commands me name myself.

AUFIDIUS:
What is thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
And harsh in sound to thine.

AUFIDIUS:
Say, what's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
thou me yet?

AUFIDIUS:
I know thee not: thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country are requited
But with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed
thee straight,
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee, for I will fight
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.

AUFIDIUS:
O Marcius, Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
The anvil of my sword, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
We have been down together in my sleep,
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
And take our friendly senators by the hands;
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Who am prepared against your territories,
Though not for Rome itself.

CORIOLANUS:
You bless me, gods!

AUFIDIUS:
Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
The leading of thine own revenges, take
The one half of my commission; and set down--
As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

First Servingman:
Here's a strange alteration!

Second Servingman:
By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him.

First Servingman:
What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.

Second Servingman:
Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
cannot tell how to term it.

First Servingman:
He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
but I thought there was more in him than I could think.

Second Servingman:
So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
man i' the world.

First Servingman:
I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.

Second Servingman:
Who, my master?

First Servingman:
Nay, it's no matter for that.

Second Servingman:
Worth six on him.

First Servingman:
Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
greater soldier.

Second Servingman:
Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.

First Servingman:
Ay, and for an assault too.

Third Servingman:
O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!

First Servingman:
What, what, what? let's partake.

Third Servingman:
I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
lieve be a condemned man.

First Servingman:
Wherefore? wherefore?

Third Servingman:
Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
Caius Marcius.

First Servingman:
Why do you say 'thwack our general '?

Third Servingman:
I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
good enough for him.

Second Servingman:
Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.

First Servingman:
He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a carbon ado.

Second Servingman:
An he had been cannibally given, he might have
broiled and eaten him too.

First Servingman:
But, more of thy news?

Third Servingman:
Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
question asked him by any of the senators, but they
stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
the middle and but one half of what he was
yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.

Second Servingman:
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.

Third Servingman:
Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.

First Servingman:
Directitude! what's that?

Third Servingman:
But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
and the man in blood, they will out of their
burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
him.

First Servingman:
But when goes this forward?

Third Servingman:
To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips.

Second Servingman:
Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
tailors, and breed ballad-makers.

First Servingman:
Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.

Second Servingman:
'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds.

First Servingman:
Ay, and it makes men hate one another.

Third Servingman:
Reason; because they then less need one another.
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.

All:
In, in, in, in!

SICINIUS:
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
His remedies are tame i' the present peace
And quietness of the people, which before
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions friendly.

BRUTUS:
We stood to't in good time.
Is this Menenius?

SICINIUS:
'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.

Both Tribunes:
Hail sir!

MENENIUS:
Hail to you both!

SICINIUS:
Your Coriolanus
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
Were he more angry at it.

MENENIUS:
All's well; and might have been much better, if
He could have temporized.

SICINIUS:
Where is he, hear you?

MENENIUS:
Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
Hear nothing from him.

Citizens:
The gods preserve you both!

SICINIUS:
God-den, our neighbours.

BRUTUS:
God-den to you all, god-den to you all.

First Citizen:
Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
Are bound to pray for you both.

SICINIUS:
Live, and thrive!

BRUTUS:
Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Had loved you as we did.

Citizens:
Now the gods keep you!

Both Tribunes:
Farewell, farewell.

SICINIUS:
This is a happier and more comely time
Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
Crying confusion.

BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
Self-loving,--

SICINIUS:
And affecting one sole throne,
Without assistance.

MENENIUS:
I think not so.

SICINIUS:
We should by this, to all our lamentation,
If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

BRUTUS:
The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
Sits safe and still without him.

AEdile:
Worthy tribunes,
There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.

MENENIUS:
'Tis Aufidius,
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
And durst not once peep out.

SICINIUS:
Come, what talk you
Of Marcius?

BRUTUS:
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
The Volsces dare break with us.

MENENIUS:
Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can,
And three examples of the like have been
Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
Before you punish him, where he heard this,
Lest you shall chance to whip your information
And beat the messenger who bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded.

SICINIUS:
Tell not me:
I know this cannot be.

BRUTUS:
Not possible.

Messenger:
The nobles in great earnestness are going
All to the senate-house: some news is come
That turns their countenances.

SICINIUS:
'Tis this slave;--
Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
Nothing but his report.

Messenger:
Yes, worthy sir,
The slave's report is seconded; and more,
More fearful, is deliver'd.

SICINIUS:
What more fearful?

Messenger:
It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
And vows revenge as spacious as between
The young'st and oldest thing.

SICINIUS:
This is most likely!

BRUTUS:
Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again.

SICINIUS:
The very trick on't.

MENENIUS:
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.

Second Messenger:
You are sent for to the senate:
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius, rages
Upon our territories; and have already
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
What lay before them.

COMINIUS:
O, you have made good work!

MENENIUS:
What news? what news?

COMINIUS:
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
To melt the city leads upon your pates,
To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--

MENENIUS:
What's the news? what's the news?

COMINIUS:
Your temples burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Into an auger's bore.

MENENIUS:
Pray now, your news?
You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--

COMINIUS:
If!
He is their god: he leads them like a thing
Made by some other deity than nature,
That shapes man better; and they follow him,
Against us brats, with no less confidence
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Or butchers killing flies.

MENENIUS:
You have made good work,
You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
on the voice of occupation and
The breath of garlic-eaters!

COMINIUS:
He will shake
Your Rome about your ears.

MENENIUS:
As Hercules
Did shake down mellow fruit.
You have made fair work!

BRUTUS:
But is this true, sir?

COMINIUS:
Ay; and you'll look pale
Before you find it other. All the regions
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
Your enemies and his find something in him.

MENENIUS:
We are all undone, unless
The noble man have mercy.

COMINIUS:
Who shall ask it?
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
As those should do that had deserved his hate,
And therein show'd like enemies.

MENENIUS:
'Tis true:
If he were putting to my house the brand
That should consume it, I have not the face
To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!

COMINIUS:
You have brought
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
So incapable of help.

Both Tribunes:
Say not we brought it.

MENENIUS:
How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
Who did hoot him out o' the city.

COMINIUS:
But I fear
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As if he were his officer: desperation
Is all the policy, strength and defence,
That Rome can make against them.

MENENIUS:
Here come the clusters.
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
if he could burn us all into one coal,
We have deserved it.

Citizens:
Faith, we hear fearful news.

First Citizen:
For mine own part,
When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.

Second Citizen:
And so did I.

Third Citizen:
And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
it was against our will.

COMINIUS:
Ye re goodly things, you voices!

MENENIUS:
You have made
Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?

COMINIUS:
O, ay, what else?

SICINIUS:
Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
These are a side that would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
And show no sign of fear.

First Citizen:
The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
him.

Second Citizen:
So did we all. But, come, let's home.

BRUTUS:
I do not like this news.

SICINIUS:
Nor I.

BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie!

SICINIUS:
Pray, let us go.

AUFIDIUS:
Do they still fly to the Roman?

Lieutenant:
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
Even by your own.

AUFIDIUS:
I cannot help it now,
Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
Even to my person, than I thought he would
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
What cannot be amended.

Lieutenant:
Yet I wish, sir,--
I mean for your particular,--you had not
Join'd in commission with him; but either
Had borne the action of yourself, or else
To him had left it solely.

AUFIDIUS:
I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
when he shall come to his account, he knows not
What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
Whene'er we come to our account.

Lieutenant:
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS:
All places yield to him ere he sits down;
And the nobility of Rome are his:
The senators and patricians love him too:
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
A noble servant to them; but he could not
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
Which out of daily fortune ever taints
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
To fail in the disposing of those chances
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
Not to be other than one thing, not moving
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
Even with the same austerity and garb
As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
As he hath spices of them all, not all,
For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
Lie in the interpretation of the time:
And power, unto itself most commendable,
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
To extol what it hath done.
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
Which was sometime his general; who loved him
In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.

COMINIUS:
He would not seem to know me.

MENENIUS:
Do you hear?

COMINIUS:
Yet one time he did call me by my name:
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
That we have bled together. Coriolanus
He would not answer to: forbad all names;
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
Of burning Rome.

MENENIUS:
Why, so: you have made good work!
A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!

COMINIUS:
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it was less expected: he replied,
It was a bare petition of a state
To one whom they had punish'd.

MENENIUS:
Very well:
Could he say less?

COMINIUS:
I offer'd to awaken his regard
For's private friends: his answer to me was,
He could not stay to pick them in a pile
Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
And still to nose the offence.

MENENIUS:
For one poor grain or two!
I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.

SICINIUS:
Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
More than the instant army we can make,
Might stop our countryman.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not meddle.

SICINIUS:
Pray you, go to him.

MENENIUS:
What should I do?

BRUTUS:
Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.

MENENIUS:
Well, and say that Marcius
Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
Unheard; what then?
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
With his unkindness? say't be so?

SICINIUS:
Yet your good will
must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
As you intended well.

MENENIUS:
I'll undertake 't:
I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
He was not taken well; he had not dined:
The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
We pout upon the morning, are unapt
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
These and these conveyances of our blood
With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
Till he be dieted to my request,
And then I'll set upon him.

BRUTUS:
You know the very road into his kindness,
And cannot lose your way.

MENENIUS:
Good faith, I'll prove him,
Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
Of my success.

COMINIUS:
He'll never hear him.

SICINIUS:
Not?

COMINIUS:
I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
So that all hope is vain.
Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.

First Senator:
Stay: whence are you?

Second Senator:
Stand, and go back.

MENENIUS:
You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
I am an officer of state, and come
To speak with Coriolanus.

First Senator:
From whence?

MENENIUS:
From Rome.

First Senator:
You may not pass, you must return: our general
Will no more hear from thence.

Second Senator:
You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
You'll speak with Coriolanus.

MENENIUS:
Good my friends,
If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.

First Senator:
Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
Is not here passable.

MENENIUS:
I tell thee, fellow,
The general is my lover: I have been
The book of his good acts, whence men have read
His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
For I have ever verified my friends,
Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
I must have leave to pass.

First Senator:
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
always factionary on the party of your general.

Second Senator:
Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
speak with him till after dinner.

First Senator:
You are a Roman, are you?

MENENIUS:
I am, as thy general is.

First Senator:
Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
when you have pushed out your gates the very
defender of them, and, in a violent popular
ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
front his revenges with the easy groans of old
women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
you out of reprieve and pardon.

MENENIUS:
Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
use me with estimation.

Second Senator:
Come, my captain knows you not.

MENENIUS:
I mean, thy general.

First Senator:
My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
the utmost of your having: back.

MENENIUS:
Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--

CORIOLANUS:
What's the matter?

MENENIUS:
Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:
You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
with him, if thou standest not i' the state of
hanging, or of some death more long in
spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
thee; but being assured none but myself could move
thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
access to thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

MENENIUS:
How! away!

CORIOLANUS:
Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
Are servanted to others: though I owe
My revenge properly, my remission lies
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!

AUFIDIUS:
You keep a constant temper.

First Senator:
Now, sir, is your name Menenius?

Second Senator:
'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
way home again.

First Senator:
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness back?

Second Senator:
What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?

MENENIUS:
I neither care for the world nor your general: for
such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,
ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
himself fears it not from another: let your general
do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and
your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
as I was said to, Away!

First Senator:
A noble fellow, I warrant him.

Second Senator:
The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
oak not to be wind-shaken.

CORIOLANUS:
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
Set down our host. My partner in this action,
You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
I have borne this business.

AUFIDIUS:
Only their ends
You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
The general suit of Rome; never admitted
A private whisper, no, not with such friends
That thought them sure of you.

CORIOLANUS:
This last old man,
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
Loved me above the measure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
The first conditions, which they did refuse
And cannot now accept; to grace him only
That thought he could do more, a very little
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
All bond and privilege of nature, break!
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
As if Olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod: and my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession, which
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
As if a man were author of himself
And knew no other kin.

VIRGILIA:
My lord and husband!

CORIOLANUS:
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

VIRGILIA:
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
Makes you think so.

CORIOLANUS:
Like a dull actor now,
I have forgot my part, and I am out,
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
And the most noble mother of the world
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
Of thy deep duty more impression show
Than that of common sons.

VOLUMNIA:
O, stand up blest!
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
I kneel before thee; and unproperly
Show duty, as mistaken all this while
Between the child and parent.

CORIOLANUS:
What is this?
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
Murdering impossibility, to make
What cannot be, slight work.

VOLUMNIA:
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?

CORIOLANUS:
The noble sister of Publicola,
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!

VOLUMNIA:
This is a poor epitome of yours,
Which by the interpretation of full time
May show like all yourself.

CORIOLANUS:
The god of soldiers,
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
And saving those that eye thee!

VOLUMNIA:
Your knee, sirrah.

CORIOLANUS:
That's my brave boy!

VOLUMNIA:
Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
Are suitors to you.

CORIOLANUS:
I beseech you, peace:
Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
To ally my rages and revenges with
Your colder reasons.

VOLUMNIA:
O, no more, no more!
You have said you will not grant us any thing;
For we have nothing else to ask, but that
Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
That, if you fail in our request, the blame
May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.

CORIOLANUS:
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?

VOLUMNIA:
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
And state of bodies would bewray what life
We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
How more unfortunate than all living women
Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
which should
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
with comforts,
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
Making the mother, wife and child to see
The son, the husband and the father tearing
His country's bowels out. And to poor we
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
Alas, how can we for our country pray.
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
Our comfort in the country. We must find
An evident calamity, though we had
Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
With manacles thorough our streets, or else
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
March to assault thy country than to tread--
Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
That brought thee to this world.

VIRGILIA:
Ay, and mine,
That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
Living to time.

Young MARCIUS:
A' shall not tread on me;
I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.

CORIOLANUS:
Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
I have sat too long.

VOLUMNIA:
Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
'This we received;' and each in either side
Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
To imitate the graces of the gods;
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more strength
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
His wife is in Corioli and his child
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
And then I'll speak a little.

CORIOLANUS:
O mother, mother!
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
Were you in my stead, would you have heard
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?

AUFIDIUS:
I was moved withal.

CORIOLANUS:
I dare be sworn you were:
And, sir, it is no little thing to make
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

AUFIDIUS:

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, by and by;
But we will drink together; and you shall bear
A better witness back than words, which we,
On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
To have a temple built you: all the swords
In Italy, and her confederate arms,
Could not have made this peace.

MENENIUS:
See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
corner-stone?

SICINIUS:
Why, what of that?

MENENIUS:
If it be possible for you to displace it with your
little finger, there is some hope the ladies of
Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
sentenced and stay upon execution.

SICINIUS:
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man!

MENENIUS:
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
creeping thing.

SICINIUS:
He loved his mother dearly.

MENENIUS:
So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne in.

SICINIUS:
Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.

MENENIUS:
I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that
shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
you.

SICINIUS:
The gods be good unto us!

MENENIUS:
No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.

Messenger:
Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
They'll give him death by inches.

SICINIUS:
What's the news?

Second Messenger:
Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

SICINIUS:
Friend,
Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?

Second Messenger:
As certain as I know the sun is fire:
Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
Make the sun dance. Hark you!

MENENIUS:
This is good news:
I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
This morning for ten thousand of your throats
I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!

SICINIUS:
First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
Accept my thankfulness.

Second Messenger:
Sir, we have all
Great cause to give great thanks.

SICINIUS:
They are near the city?

Second Messenger:
Almost at point to enter.

SICINIUS:
We will meet them,
And help the joy.

First Senator:
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'

All:
Welcome, ladies, Welcome!

AUFIDIUS:
Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
Deliver them this paper: having read it,
Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Intends to appear before the people, hoping
To purge herself with words: dispatch.
Most welcome!

First Conspirator:
How is it with our general?

AUFIDIUS:
Even so
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
And with his charity slain.

Second Conspirator:
Most noble sir,
If you do hold the same intent wherein
You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
Of your great danger.

AUFIDIUS:
Sir, I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do find the people.

Third Conspirator:
The people will remain uncertain whilst
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all.

AUFIDIUS:
I know it;
And my pretext to strike at him admits
A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
He bow'd his nature, never known before
But to be rough, unswayable and free.

Third Conspirator:
Sir, his stoutness
When he did stand for consul, which he lost
By lack of stooping,--

AUFIDIUS:
That I would have spoke of:
Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
My best and freshest men; served his designments
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
Which he did end all his; and took some pride
To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
He waged me with his countenance, as if
I had been mercenary.

First Conspirator:
So he did, my lord:
The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
For no less spoil than glory,--

AUFIDIUS:
There was it:
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!

First Conspirator:
Your native town you enter'd like a post,
And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
Splitting the air with noise.

Second Conspirator:
And patient fools,
Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
With giving him glory.

Third Conspirator:
Therefore, at your vantage,
Ere he express himself, or move the people
With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
Which we will second. When he lies along,
After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
His reasons with his body.

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more:
Here come the lords.

All The Lords:
You are most welcome home.

AUFIDIUS:
I have not deserved it.
But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
What I have written to you?

Lords:
We have.

First Lord:
And grieve to hear't.
What faults he made before the last, I think
Might have found easy fines: but there to end
Where he was to begin and give away
The benefit of our levies, answering us
With our own charge, making a treaty where
There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.

AUFIDIUS:
He approaches: you shall hear him.

CORIOLANUS:
Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
No more infected with my country's love
Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
Under your great command. You are to know
That prosperously I have attempted and
With bloody passage led your wars even to
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
The charges of the action. We have made peace
With no less honour to the Antiates
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
Together with the seal o' the senate, what
We have compounded on.

AUFIDIUS:
Read it not, noble lords;
But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
He hath abused your powers.

CORIOLANUS:
Traitor! how now!

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, traitor, Marcius!

CORIOLANUS:
Marcius!

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
Coriolanus in Corioli?
You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
He has betray'd your business, and given up,
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
He whined and roar'd away your victory,
That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
Look'd wondering each at other.

CORIOLANUS:
Hear'st thou, Mars?

AUFIDIUS:
Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS:
Ha!

AUFIDIUS:
No more.

CORIOLANUS:
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.

First Lord:
Peace, both, and hear me speak.

CORIOLANUS:
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Alone I did it. Boy!

AUFIDIUS:
Why, noble lords,
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
'Fore your own eyes and ears?

All Conspirators:
Let him die for't.

All The People:
'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'

Second Lord:
Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
The man is noble and his fame folds-in
This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
And trouble not the peace.

CORIOLANUS:
O that I had him,
With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
To use my lawful sword!

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

All Conspirators:
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

Lords:
Hold, hold, hold, hold!

AUFIDIUS:
My noble masters, hear me speak.

First Lord:
O Tullus,--

Second Lord:
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.

Third Lord:
Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
Put up your swords.

AUFIDIUS:
My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
Myself your loyal servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure.

First Lord:
Bear from hence his body;
And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
As the most noble corse that ever herald
Did follow to his urn.

Second Lord:
His own impatience
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Let's make the best of it.

AUFIDIUS:
My rage is gone;
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
Which to this hour bewail the injury,
Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.

GLOUCESTER:
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other:
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
Clarence comes.
Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
That waits upon your grace?

CLARENCE:
His majesty
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
Upon what cause?

CLARENCE:
Because my name is George.

GLOUCESTER:
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
O, belike his majesty hath some intent
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?

CLARENCE:
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be;
And, for my name of George begins with G,
It follows in his thought that I am he.
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
Have moved his highness to commit me now.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?

GLOUCESTER:
Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
If we will keep in favour with the king,
To be her men and wear her livery:
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference,
Of what degree soever, with his brother.

GLOUCESTER:
Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
You may partake of any thing we say:
We speak no treason, man: we say the king
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?

BRAKENBURY:
With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.

GLOUCESTER:
Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
Were best he do it secretly, alone.

BRAKENBURY:
What one, my lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.

CLARENCE:
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

GLOUCESTER:
We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
And whatsoever you will employ me in,
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.

CLARENCE:
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

GLOUCESTER:
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
Meantime, have patience.

CLARENCE:
I must perforce. Farewell.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?

HASTINGS:
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!

GLOUCESTER:
As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
Well are you welcome to the open air.
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?

HASTINGS:
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
That were the cause of my imprisonment.

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
For they that were your enemies are his,
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.

HASTINGS:
More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
What news abroad?

HASTINGS:
No news so bad abroad as this at home;
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
And his physicians fear him mightily.

GLOUCESTER:
Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
And overmuch consumed his royal person:
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
What, is he in his bed?

HASTINGS:
He is.

GLOUCESTER:
Go you before, and I will follow you.
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
Clarence hath not another day to live:
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father:
The which will I; not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent,
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
But yet I run before my horse to market:
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

LADY ANNE:
Set down, set down your honourable load,
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
If ever he have child, abortive be it,
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
If ever he have wife, let her he made
A miserable by the death of him
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
And still, as you are weary of the weight,
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.

GLOUCESTER:
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.

LADY ANNE:
What black magician conjures up this fiend,
To stop devoted charitable deeds?

GLOUCESTER:
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.

Gentleman:
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.

GLOUCESTER:
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.

LADY ANNE:
What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.

LADY ANNE:
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
Either heaven with lightning strike the
murderer dead,
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know no rules of charity,
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.

LADY ANNE:
Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

GLOUCESTER:
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.

LADY ANNE:
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!

GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.

LADY ANNE:
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
For these known evils, but to give me leave,
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.

GLOUCESTER:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

GLOUCESTER:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

GLOUCESTER:
Say that I slew them not?

LADY ANNE:
Why, then they are not dead:
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.

GLOUCESTER:
I did not kill your husband.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then he is alive.

GLOUCESTER:
Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.

LADY ANNE:
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.

GLOUCESTER:
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.

LADY ANNE:
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
Didst thou not kill this king?

GLOUCESTER:
I grant ye.

LADY ANNE:
Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!

GLOUCESTER:
The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.

LADY ANNE:
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.

GLOUCESTER:
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
For he was fitter for that place than earth.

LADY ANNE:
And thou unfit for any place but hell.

GLOUCESTER:
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.

LADY ANNE:
Some dungeon.

GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.

LADY ANNE:
I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!

GLOUCESTER:
So will it, madam till I lie with you.

LADY ANNE:
I hope so.

GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
As blameful as the executioner?

LADY ANNE:
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.

GLOUCESTER:
Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world,
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.

LADY ANNE:
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.

GLOUCESTER:
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
As all the world is cheered by the sun,
So I by that; it is my day, my life.

LADY ANNE:
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!

GLOUCESTER:
Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.

LADY ANNE:
I would I were, to be revenged on thee.

GLOUCESTER:
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
To be revenged on him that loveth you.

LADY ANNE:
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.

GLOUCESTER:
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
Did it to help thee to a better husband.

LADY ANNE:
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.

GLOUCESTER:
He lives that loves thee better than he could.

LADY ANNE:
Name him.

GLOUCESTER:
Plantagenet.

LADY ANNE:
Why, that was he.

GLOUCESTER:
The selfsame name, but one of better nature.

LADY ANNE:
Where is he?

GLOUCESTER:
Here.
Why dost thou spit at me?

LADY ANNE:
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!

GLOUCESTER:
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

LADY ANNE:
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.

GLOUCESTER:
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

LADY ANNE:
Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!

GLOUCESTER:
I would they were, that I might die at once;
For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
No, when my father York and Edward wept,
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
Told the sad story of my father's death,
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
Take up the sword again, or take up me.

LADY ANNE:
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
I will not be the executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.

LADY ANNE:
I have already.

GLOUCESTER:
Tush, that was in thy rage:
Speak it again, and, even with the word,
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.

LADY ANNE:
I would I knew thy heart.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis figured in my tongue.

LADY ANNE:
I fear me both are false.

GLOUCESTER:
Then never man was true.

LADY ANNE:
Well, well, put up your sword.

GLOUCESTER:
Say, then, my peace is made.

LADY ANNE:
That shall you know hereafter.

GLOUCESTER:
But shall I live in hope?

LADY ANNE:
All men, I hope, live so.

GLOUCESTER:
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

LADY ANNE:
To take is not to give.

GLOUCESTER:
Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.

LADY ANNE:
What is it?

GLOUCESTER:
That it would please thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
And presently repair to Crosby Place;
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
I will with all expedient duty see you:
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
Grant me this boon.

LADY ANNE:
With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
To see you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.

GLOUCESTER:
Bid me farewell.

LADY ANNE:
'Tis more than you deserve;
But since you teach me how to flatter you,
Imagine I have said farewell already.

GLOUCESTER:
Sirs, take up the corse.

GENTLEMEN:
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?

GLOUCESTER:
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, and these bars
against me,
And I nothing to back my suit at all,
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
And made her widow to a woful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
I do mistake my person all this while:
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
And entertain some score or two of tailors,
To study fashions to adorn my body:
Since I am crept in favour with myself,
Will maintain it with some little cost.
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as I pass.

RIVERS:
Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.

GREY:
In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If he were dead, what would betide of me?

RIVERS:
No other harm but loss of such a lord.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The loss of such a lord includes all harm.

GREY:
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
To be your comforter when he is gone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, he is young and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.

RIVERS:
Is it concluded that he shall be protector?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It is determined, not concluded yet:
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.

GREY:
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good time of day unto your royal grace!

DERBY:
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.

DERBY:
I do beseech you, either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
Or, if she be accused in true report,
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.

RIVERS:
Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?

DERBY:
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant him health! Did you confer with him?

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Would all were well! but that will never be
I fear our happiness is at the highest.

GLOUCESTER:
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
Who are they that complain unto the king,
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
But thus his simple truth must be abused
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?

RIVERS:
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?

GLOUCESTER:
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
The king, of his own royal disposition,
And not provoked by any suitor else;
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
Which in your outward actions shows itself
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
Since every Jack became a gentleman
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and my friends':
God grant we never may have need of you!

GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
Myself disgraced, and the nobility
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By Him that raised me to this careful height
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did incense his majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
My lord, you do me shameful injury,
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

GLOUCESTER:
You may deny that you were not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

RIVERS:
She may, my lord, for--

GLOUCESTER:
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that:
She may help you to many fair preferments,
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
And lay those honours on your high deserts.
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--

RIVERS:
What, marry, may she?

GLOUCESTER:
What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
I wis your grandam had a worser match.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
With those gross taunts I often have endured.
I had rather be a country servant-maid
Than a great queen, with this condition,
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
Small joy have I in being England's queen.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.

GLOUCESTER:
What! threat you me with telling of the king?
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king:
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Out, devil! I remember them too well:
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.

GLOUCESTER:
Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends:
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.

GLOUCESTER:
In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
What you have been ere now, and what you are;
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.

GLOUCESTER:
Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

QUEEN MARGARET:
Which God revenge!

GLOUCESTER:
To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
I am too childish-foolish for this world.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.

RIVERS:
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
So should we you, if you should be our king.

GLOUCESTER:
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
As little joy may you suppose in me.
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
O gentle villain, do not turn away!

GLOUCESTER:
Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?

QUEEN MARGARET:
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
That will I make before I let thee go.

GLOUCESTER:
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband and a son thou owest to me;
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

GLOUCESTER:
The curse my noble father laid on thee,
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So just is God, to right the innocent.

HASTINGS:
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!

RIVERS:
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.

DORSET:
No man but prophesied revenge for it.

BUCKINGHAM:
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What were you snarling all before I came,
Ready to catch each other by the throat,
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
As ours by murder, to make him a king!
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
And see another, as I see thee now,
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
Long die thy happy days before thy death;
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
That none of you may live your natural age,
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!

GLOUCESTER:
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

QUEEN MARGARET:
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
And then hurl down their indignation
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
Thou rag of honour! thou detested--

GLOUCESTER:
Margaret.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

GLOUCESTER:
Ha!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call thee not.

GLOUCESTER:
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
O, let me make the period to my curse!

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.

HASTINGS:
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.

RIVERS:
Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.

QUEEN MARGARET:
To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!

DORSET:
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
O, that your young nobility could judge
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.

GLOUCESTER:
Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.

DORSET:
It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.

GLOUCESTER:
Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done! for shame, if not for charity.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
My charity is outrage, life my shame
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done, have done.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
In sign of league and amity with thee:
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.

QUEEN MARGARET:
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
Have not to do with him, beware of him;
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
And all their ministers attend on him.

GLOUCESTER:
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember this another day,
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!

HASTINGS:
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.

RIVERS:
And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
My part thereof that I have done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did her any, to my knowledge.

GLOUCESTER:
But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good,
That is too cold in thinking of it now.
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
God pardon them that are the cause of it!

RIVERS:
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
To pray for them that have done scathe to us.

GLOUCESTER:
So do I ever:
being well-advised.
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.

CATESBY:
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?

RIVERS:
Madam, we will attend your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gulls
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
And say it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
But, soft! here come my executioners.
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?

First Murderer:
We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
That we may be admitted where he is.

GLOUCESTER:
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.

First Murderer:
Tush!
Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
Talkers are no good doers: be assured
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.

GLOUCESTER:
Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
I like you, lads; about your business straight;
Go, go, dispatch.

First Murderer:
We will, my noble lord.

BRAKENBURY:
Why looks your grace so heavily today?

CLARENCE:
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time!

BRAKENBURY:
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.

BRAKENBURY:
Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?

CLARENCE:
Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.

BRAKENBURY:
Awaked you not with this sore agony?

CLARENCE:
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
I trembling waked, and for a season after
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
Such terrible impression made the dream.

BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
Which now bear evidence against my soul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

BRAKENBURY:
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
Princes have but their tides for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward toil;
And, for unfelt imagination,
They often feel a world of restless cares:
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.

First Murderer:
Ho! who's here?

BRAKENBURY:
In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?

First Murderer:
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.

BRAKENBURY:
Yea, are you so brief?

Second Murderer:
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
him our commission; talk no more.

BRAKENBURY:
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
I'll to the king; and signify to him
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.

First Murderer:
Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.

Second Murderer:
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?

First Murderer:
No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.

Second Murderer:
When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
the judgment-day.

First Murderer:
Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.

Second Murderer:
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
of remorse in me.

First Murderer:
What, art thou afraid?

Second Murderer:
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.

First Murderer:
I thought thou hadst been resolute.

Second Murderer:
So I am, to let him live.

First Murderer:
Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.

Second Murderer:
I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty.

First Murderer:
How dost thou feel thyself now?

Second Murderer:
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
within me.

First Murderer:
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.

Second Murderer:
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.

First Murderer:
Where is thy conscience now?

Second Murderer:
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.

First Murderer:
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
thy conscience flies out.

Second Murderer:
Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.

First Murderer:
How if it come to thee again?

Second Murderer:
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it.

First Murderer:
'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
not to kill the duke.

Second Murderer:
Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.

First Murderer:
Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
I warrant thee.

Second Murderer:
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?

First Murderer:
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
in the next room.

Second Murderer:
O excellent devise! make a sop of him.

First Murderer:
Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?

Second Murderer:
No, first let's reason with him.

CLARENCE:
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.

Second murderer:
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.

CLARENCE:
In God's name, what art thou?

Second Murderer:
A man, as you are.

CLARENCE:
But not, as I am, royal.

Second Murderer:
Nor you, as we are, loyal.

CLARENCE:
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

Second Murderer:
My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.

CLARENCE:
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?

Both:
To, to, to--

CLARENCE:
To murder me?

Both:
Ay, ay.

CLARENCE:
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

First Murderer:
Offended us you have not, but the king.

CLARENCE:
I shall be reconciled to him again.

Second Murderer:
Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.

CLARENCE:
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of law,
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
That you depart and lay no hands on me
The deed you undertake is damnable.

First Murderer:
What we will do, we do upon command.

Second Murderer:
And he that hath commanded is the king.

CLARENCE:
Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.

Second Murderer:
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
For false forswearing and for murder too:
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.

First Murderer:
And, like a traitor to the name of God,
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.

Second Murderer:
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.

First Murderer:
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?

CLARENCE:
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder me for this
For in this sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be revenged for this deed.
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off those that have offended him.

First Murderer:
Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?

CLARENCE:
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.

First Murderer:
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE:
Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.

Second Murderer:
You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.

CLARENCE:
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
Go you to him from me.

Both:
Ay, so we will.

CLARENCE:
Tell him, when that our princely father York
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
And charged us from his soul to love each other,
He little thought of this divided friendship:
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.

First Murderer:
Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.

CLARENCE:
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.

First Murderer:
Right,
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE:
It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
That he would labour my delivery.

Second Murderer:
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.

First Murderer:
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.

CLARENCE:
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.

Second Murderer:
What shall we do?

CLARENCE:
Relent, and save your souls.

First Murderer:
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.

CLARENCE:
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
Would not entreat for life?
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
As you would beg, were you in my distress
A begging prince what beggar pities not?

Second Murderer:
Look behind you, my lord.

First Murderer:
Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.

Second Murderer:
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!

First Murderer:
How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!

Second Murderer:
I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
For I repent me that the duke is slain.

First Murderer:
So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
Now must I hide his body in some hole,
Until the duke take order for his burial:
And when I have my meed, I must away;
For this will out, and here I must not stay.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
You peers, continue this united league:
I every day expect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.

RIVERS:
By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.

HASTINGS:
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!

KING EDWARD IV:
Take heed you dally not before your king;
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
Either of you to be the other's end.

HASTINGS:
So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!

RIVERS:
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!

KING EDWARD IV:
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
You have been factious one against the other,
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!

KING EDWARD IV:
Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.

DORSET:
This interchange of love, I here protest,
Upon my part shall be unviolable.

HASTINGS:
And so swear I, my lord

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
And make me happy in your unity.

BUCKINGHAM:
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yours,
but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love!
When I have most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
When I am cold in zeal to yours.

KING EDWARD IV:
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
To make the perfect period of this peace.

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.

GLOUCESTER:
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!

KING EDWARD IV:
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
Brother, we done deeds of charity;
Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

GLOUCESTER:
A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
Hold me a foe;
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
By any in this presence, I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
That without desert have frown'd on me;
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the infant that is born to-night
I thank my God for my humility.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
To be so bouted in this royal presence?
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
You do him injury to scorn his corse.

RIVERS:
Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All seeing heaven, what a world is this!

BUCKINGHAM:
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?

DORSET:
Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.

GLOUCESTER:
But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
And that a winged Mercury did bear:
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
That came too lag to see him buried.
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
And yet go current from suspicion!

DORSET:
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!

KING EDWARD IV:
I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.

DORSET:
I will not rise, unless your highness grant.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.

DORSET:
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.

KING EDWARD IV:
Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
And yet his punishment was cruel death.
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
And I unjustly too, must grant it you
But for my brother not a man would speak,
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
Have been beholding to him in his life;
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
Oh, poor Clarence!

GLOUCESTER:
This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the king!
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
To comfort Edward with our company.

BUCKINGHAM:
We wait upon your grace.

Boy:
Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, boy.

Boy:
Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'

Girl:
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
If that our noble father be alive?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
I do lament the sickness of the king.
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.

Boy:
Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
The king my uncle is to blame for this:
God will revenge it; whom I will importune
With daily prayers all to that effect.

Girl:
And so will I.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
Incapable and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess who caused your father's death.

Boy:
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
Devised impeachments to imprison him :
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
Bade me rely on him as on my father,
And he would love me dearly as his child.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

Boy:
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ay, boy.

Boy:
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
I'll join with black despair against my soul,
And to myself become an enemy.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What means this scene of rude impatience?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To make an act of tragic violence:
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble husband!
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
And lived by looking on his images:
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
And I for comfort have but one false glass,
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!

Boy:
Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?

Girl:
Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Give me no help in lamentation;
I am not barren to bring forth complaints
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!

Children:
Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.

Children:
What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What stays had I but they? and they are gone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Was never widow had so dear a loss!

Children:
Were never orphans had so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Was never mother had so dear a loss!
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
And I will pamper it with lamentations.

DORSET:
Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.

RIVERS:
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.

GLOUCESTER:
Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shining star;
But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
Now cheer each other in each other's love
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.

RIVERS:
Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
Which would be so much the more dangerous
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
And may direct his course as please himself,
As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.

GLOUCESTER:
I hope the king made peace with all of us
And the compact is firm and true in me.

RIVERS:
And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
Which haply by much company might be urged:
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.

HASTINGS:
And so say I.

GLOUCESTER:
Then be it so; and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
To give your censures in this weighty business?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
With all our harts.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
As index to the story we late talk'd of,
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.

GLOUCESTER:
My other self, my counsel's consistory,
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.

First Citizen:
Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?

Second Citizen:
I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
Hear you the news abroad?

First Citizen:
Ay, that the king is dead.

Second Citizen:
Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.

Third Citizen:
Neighbours, God speed!

First Citizen:
Give you good morrow, sir.

Third Citizen:
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?

Second Citizen:
Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!

Third Citizen:
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.

First Citizen:
No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.

Third Citizen:
Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!

Second Citizen:
In him there is a hope of government,
That in his nonage council under him,
And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.

First Citizen:
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.

Third Citizen:
Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
For then this land was famously enrich'd
With politic grave counsel; then the king
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.

First Citizen:
Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.

Third Citizen:
Better it were they all came by the father,
Or by the father there were none at all;
For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
This sickly land might solace as before.

First Citizen:
Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.

Third Citizen:
When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.

Second Citizen:
Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
Ye cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and full of fear.

Third Citizen:
Before the times of change, still is it so:
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
But leave it all to God. whither away?

Second Citizen:
Marry, we were sent for to the justices.

Third Citizen:
And so was I: I'll bear you company.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I long with all my heart to see the prince:
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But I hear, no; they say my son of York
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.

YORK:
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.

YORK:
Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
Gloucester,
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
In him that did object the same to thee;
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
So long a-growing and so leisurely,
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.

YORK:
Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.

YORK:
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?

YORK:
Grandam, his nurse.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.

YORK:
If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Good madam, be not angry with the child.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Pitchers have ears.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Here comes a messenger. What news?

Messenger:
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How fares the prince?

Messenger:
Well, madam, and in health.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is thy news then?

Messenger:
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who hath committed them?

Messenger:
The mighty dukes
Gloucester and Buckingham.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For what offence?

Messenger:
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
Why or for what these nobles were committed
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
I see, as in a map, the end of all.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
My husband lost his life to get the crown;
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
And being seated, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
Self against self: O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
Or let me die, to look on death no more!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
Madam, farewell.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'll go along with you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You have no cause.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
My gracious lady, go;
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours!
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
The weary way hath made you melancholy.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
I want more uncles here to welcome me.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!

PRINCE EDWARD:
God keep me from false friends! but they were none.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.

Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace with health and happy days!

PRINCE EDWARD:
I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
I thought my mother, and my brother York,
Would long ere this have met us on the way
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
To tell us whether they will come or no!

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?

HASTINGS:
On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
The queen your mother, and your brother York,
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
But by his mother was perforce withheld.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently?
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

CARDINAL:
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
We should infringe the holy privilege
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.

BUCKINGHAM:
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
Too ceremonious and traditional
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
The benefit thereof is always granted
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
And those who have the wit to claim the place:
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
You break no privilege nor charter there.
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.

CARDINAL:
My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?

HASTINGS:
I go, my lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?

GLOUCESTER:
Where it seems best unto your royal self.
If I may counsel you, some day or two
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
For your best health and recreation.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I do not like the Tower, of any place.
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Is it upon record, or else reported
Successively from age to age, he built it?

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon record, my gracious lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
Even to the general all-ending day.

GLOUCESTER:

PRINCE EDWARD:
What say you, uncle?

GLOUCESTER:
I say, without characters, fame lives long.
Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two meanings in one word.

PRINCE EDWARD:
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
With what his valour did enrich his wit,
His wit set down to make his valour live
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--

BUCKINGHAM:
What, my gracious lord?

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if I live until I be a man,
I'll win our ancient right in France again,
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?

YORK:
Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
Too late he died that might have kept that title,
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.

GLOUCESTER:
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?

YORK:
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.

GLOUCESTER:
He hath, my lord.

YORK:
And therefore is he idle?

GLOUCESTER:
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.

YORK:
Then is he more beholding to you than I.

GLOUCESTER:
He may command me as my sovereign;
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.

YORK:
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.

GLOUCESTER:
My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.

PRINCE EDWARD:
A beggar, brother?

YORK:
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.

GLOUCESTER:
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.

YORK:
A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.

GLOUCESTER:
A gentle cousin, were it light enough.

YORK:
O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.

GLOUCESTER:
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.

YORK:
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

GLOUCESTER:
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?

YORK:
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.

GLOUCESTER:
How?

YORK:
Little.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.

YORK:
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
Because that I am little, like an ape,
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.

BUCKINGHAM:
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
So cunning and so young is wonderful.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, will't please you pass along?
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother, to entreat of her
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.

YORK:
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?

PRINCE EDWARD:
My lord protector needs will have it so.

YORK:
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what should you fear?

YORK:
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
My grandam told me he was murdered there.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I fear no uncles dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Nor none that live, I hope.

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.

BUCKINGHAM:
Think you, my lord, this little prating York
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
As closely to conceal what we impart:
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
For the instalment of this noble duke
In the seat royal of this famous isle?

CATESBY:
He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
That he will not be won to aught against him.

BUCKINGHAM:
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?

CATESBY:
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
To sit about the coronation.
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
And give us notice of his inclination:
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.

CATESBY:
My good lords both, with all the heed I may.

GLOUCESTER:
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

CATESBY:
You shall, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?

GLOUCESTER:
Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.

BUCKINGHAM:
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.

GLOUCESTER:
And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
We may digest our complots in some form.

Messenger:
What, ho! my lord!

HASTINGS:

Messenger:
A messenger from the Lord Stanley.

HASTINGS:
What is't o'clock?

Messenger:
Upon the stroke of four.

HASTINGS:
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?

Messenger:
So it should seem by that I have to say.
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.

HASTINGS:
And then?

Messenger:
And then he sends you word
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
Besides, he says there are two councils held;
And that may be determined at the one
which may make you and him to rue at the other.
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
If presently you will take horse with him,
And with all speed post with him toward the north,
To shun the danger that his soul divines.

HASTINGS:
Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
Bid him not fear the separated councils
His honour and myself are at the one,
And at the other is my servant Catesby
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
Were to incense the boar to follow us
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
And we will both together to the Tower,
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.

Messenger:
My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.

CATESBY:
Many good morrows to my noble lord!

HASTINGS:
Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
What news, what news, in this our tottering state?

CATESBY:
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
And I believe twill never stand upright
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.

HASTINGS:
How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?

CATESBY:
Ay, my good lord.

HASTINGS:
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?

CATESBY:
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
Upon his party for the gain thereof:
And thereupon he sends you this good news,
That this same very day your enemies,
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.

HASTINGS:
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
Because they have been still mine enemies:
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
God knows I will not do it, to the death.

CATESBY:
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!

HASTINGS:
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
That they who brought me in my master's hate
I live to look upon their tragedy.
I tell thee, Catesby--

CATESBY:
What, my lord?

HASTINGS:
Ere a fortnight make me elder,
I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.

CATESBY:
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
When men are unprepared and look not for it.

HASTINGS:
O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
With some men else, who think themselves as safe
As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.

CATESBY:
The princes both make high account of you;
For they account his head upon the bridge.

HASTINGS:
I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?

STANLEY:
My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
I do not like these several councils, I.

HASTINGS:
My lord,
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
And never in my life, I do protest,
Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
Think you, but that I know our state secure,
I would be so triumphant as I am?

STANLEY:
The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.

HASTINGS:
Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.

LORD STANLEY:
They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
But come, my lord, let us away.

HASTINGS:
Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?

Pursuivant:
The better that your lordship please to ask.

HASTINGS:
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
This day those enemies are put to death,
And I in better state than e'er I was.

Pursuivant:
God hold it, to your honour's good content!

HASTINGS:
Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.

Pursuivant:
God save your lordship!

Priest:
Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.

HASTINGS:
I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
I am in your debt for your last exercise;
Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.

BUCKINGHAM:
What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.

HASTINGS:
Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
Those men you talk of came into my mind.
What, go you toward the Tower?

BUCKINGHAM:
I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
I shall return before your lordship thence.

HASTINGS:
'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.

BUCKINGHAM:

HASTINGS:
I'll wait upon your lordship.

RATCLIFF:
Come, bring forth the prisoners.

RIVERS:
Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.

GREY:
God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!

VAUGHAN:
You live that shall cry woe for this after.

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.

RIVERS:
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.

GREY:
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.

RIVERS:
Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
And for my sister and her princely sons,
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

RATCLIFF:
Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.

RIVERS:
Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.

HASTINGS:
My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
Is, to determine of the coronation.
In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?

BUCKINGHAM:
Are all things fitting for that royal time?

DERBY:
It is, and wants but nomination.

BISHOP OF ELY:
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
Who is most inward with the royal duke?

BISHOP OF ELY:
Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
Than I of yours;
Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.

HASTINGS:
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
But, for his purpose in the coronation.
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
His gracious pleasure any way therein:
But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.

GLOUCESTER:
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence doth neglect no great designs,
Which by my presence might have been concluded.

BUCKINGHAM:
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.

GLOUCESTER:
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.

HASTINGS:
I thank your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord of Ely!

BISHOP OF ELY:
My lord?

GLOUCESTER:
When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I do beseech you send for some of them.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.

GLOUCESTER:
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
As he will lose his head ere give consent
His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.

BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.

DERBY:
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
For I myself am not so well provided
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
strawberries.

HASTINGS:
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
There's some conceit or other likes him well,
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
I think there's never a man in Christendom
That can less hide his love or hate than he;
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.

DERBY:
What of his heart perceive you in his face
By any likelihood he show'd to-day?

HASTINGS:
Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.

DERBY:
I pray God he be not, I say.

GLOUCESTER:
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
Upon my body with their hellish charms?

HASTINGS:
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
Makes me most forward in this noble presence
To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.

GLOUCESTER:
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

HASTINGS:
If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--

GLOUCESTER:
If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
I will not dine until I see the same.
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.

HASTINGS:
Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
I now repent I told the pursuivant
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
And I myself secure in grace and favour.
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.

HASTINGS:
O momentary grace of mortal men,
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.

LOVEL:
Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.

HASTINGS:
O bloody Richard! miserable England!
I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
And then begin again, and stop again,
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?

BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
And both are ready in their offices,
At any time, to grace my stratagems.
But what, is Catesby gone?

GLOUCESTER:
He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--

GLOUCESTER:
Look to the drawbridge there!

BUCKINGHAM:
Hark! a drum.

GLOUCESTER:
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--

GLOUCESTER:
Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.

BUCKINGHAM:
God and our innocency defend and guard us!

GLOUCESTER:
Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.

LOVEL:
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

GLOUCESTER:
So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts:
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
He lived from all attainder of suspect.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
That ever lived.
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
Were't not that, by great preservation,
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
This day had plotted, in the council-house
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?

Lord Mayor:
What, had he so?

GLOUCESTER:
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we would, against the form of law,
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
But that the extreme peril of the case,
The peace of England and our persons' safety,
Enforced us to this execution?

Lord Mayor:
Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
I never look'd for better at his hands,
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.

GLOUCESTER:
Yet had not we determined he should die,
Until your lordship came to see his death;
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
The traitor speak, and timorously confess
The manner and the purpose of his treason;
That you might well have signified the same
Unto the citizens, who haply may
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.

Lord Mayor:
But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
As well as I had seen and heard him speak
And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
With all your just proceedings in this cause.

GLOUCESTER:
And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
To avoid the carping censures of the world.

BUCKINGHAM:
But since you come too late of our intents,
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
Only for saying he would make his son
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
And bestial appetite in change of lust;
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
Without control, listed to make his prey.
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
Tell them, when that my mother went with child
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
My princely father then had wars in France
And, by just computation of the time,
Found that the issue was not his begot;
Which well appeared in his lineaments,
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.

GLOUCESTER:
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
Where you shall find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.

BUCKINGHAM:
I go: and towards three or four o'clock
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
Now will I in, to take some privy order,
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
And to give notice, that no manner of person
At any time have recourse unto the princes.

Scrivener:
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
The precedent was full as long a-doing:
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
That seeth not this palpable device?
Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.

GLOUCESTER:
How now, my lord, what say the citizens?

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.

GLOUCESTER:
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?

BUCKINGHAM:
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his contract by deputy in France;
The insatiate greediness of his desires,
And his enforcement of the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
As being got, your father then in France,
His resemblance, being not like the duke;
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
Being the right idea of your father,
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
And when mine oratory grew to an end
I bid them that did love their country's good
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'

GLOUCESTER:
Ah! and did they so?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
His answer was, the people were not wont
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
When he had done, some followers of mine own,
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
And thus I took the vantage of those few,
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
'This general applause and loving shout
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
And even here brake off, and came away.

GLOUCESTER:
What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my troth, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?

BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
And be not easily won to our request:
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.

GLOUCESTER:
I go; and if you plead as well for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself,
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.

BUCKINGHAM:
Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
What says he?

CATESBY:
My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
To visit him to-morrow or next day:
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
Divinely bent to meditation;
And no worldly suit would he be moved,
To draw him from his holy exercise.

BUCKINGHAM:
Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
In deep designs and matters of great moment,
No less importing than our general good,
Are come to have some conference with his grace.

CATESBY:
I'll tell him what you say, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
But on his knees at meditation;
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
But meditating with two deep divines;
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
Happy were England, would this gracious prince
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.

Lord Mayor:
Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!

BUCKINGHAM:
I fear he will.
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?

CATESBY:
My lord,
He wonders to what end you have assembled
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
And so once more return and tell his grace.
When holy and devout religious men
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
So sweet is zealous contemplation.

Lord Mayor:
See, where he stands between two clergymen!

BUCKINGHAM:
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
To stay him from the fall of vanity:
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
True ornaments to know a holy man.
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
Lend favourable ears to our request;
And pardon us the interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, there needs no such apology:
I rather do beseech you pardon me,
Who, earnest in the service of my God,
Neglect the visitation of my friends.
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.

GLOUCESTER:
I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.

BUCKINGHAM:
You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!

GLOUCESTER:
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?

BUCKINGHAM:
Then know, it is your fault that you resign
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
The lineal glory of your royal house,
To the corruption of a blemished stock:
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
Which here we waken to our country's good,
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
Which to recure, we heartily solicit
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
And kingly government of this your land,
Not as protector, steward, substitute,
Or lowly factor for another's gain;
But as successively from blood to blood,
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
For this, consorted with the citizens,
Your very worshipful and loving friends,
And by their vehement instigation,
In this just suit come I to move your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
I know not whether to depart in silence,
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
If not to answer, you might haply think
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
So season'd with your faithful love to me.
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
Definitively thus I answer you.
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
First if all obstacles were cut away,
And that my path were even to the crown,
As my ripe revenue and due by birth
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
So mighty and so many my defects,
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
Will well become the seat of majesty,
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
On him I lay what you would lay on me,
The right and fortune of his happy stars;
Which God defend that I should wring from him!

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
All circumstances well considered.
You say that Edward is your brother's son:
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
And afterward by substitute betroth'd
To Bona, sister to the King of France.
These both put by a poor petitioner,
A care-crazed mother of a many children,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
Even in the afternoon of her best days,
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
To base declension and loathed bigamy
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
More bitterly could I expostulate,
Save that, for reverence to some alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
If non to bless us and the land withal,
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusing times,
Unto a lineal true-derived course.

Lord Mayor:
Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.

BUCKINGHAM:
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.

CATESBY:
O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
I am unfit for state and majesty;
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.

BUCKINGHAM:
If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
Which we have noted in you to your kin,
And egally indeed to all estates,--
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
But we will plant some other in the throne,
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
And in this resolution here we leave you.--
Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.

GLOUCESTER:
O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.

CATESBY:
Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.

GLOUCESTER:
Would you enforce me to a world of care?
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
I must have patience to endure the load:
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
Attend the sequel of your imposition,
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
For God he knows, and you may partly see,
How far I am from the desire thereof.

Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.

GLOUCESTER:
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.

BUCKINGHAM:
Then I salute you with this kingly title:
Long live Richard, England's royal king!

Lord Mayor:
Amen.

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?

GLOUCESTER:
Even when you please, since you will have it so.

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
And so most joyfully we take our leave.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, let us to our holy task again.
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
Daughter, well met.

LADY ANNE:
God give your graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As much to you, good sister! Whither away?

LADY ANNE:
No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
To gratulate the gentle princes there.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?

BRAKENBURY:
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
I may not suffer you to visit them;
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king! why, who's that?

BRAKENBURY:
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am their fathers mother; I will see them.

LADY ANNE:
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.

BRAKENBURY:
No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.

LORD STANLEY:
Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
With this dead-killing news!

LADY ANNE:
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!

DORSET:
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

LORD STANLEY:
Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
You shall have letters from me to my son
To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

LORD STANLEY:
Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.

LADY ANNE:
And I in all unwillingness will go.
I would to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.

LADY ANNE:
No! why?  When he that is my husband now
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
Which issued from my other angel husband
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
For making me, so young, so old a widow!
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
As miserable by the life of thee
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
For never yet one hour in his bed
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.

LADY ANNE:
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!

LADY ANNE:
Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!

DUCHESS OF YORK:

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
For tender princes, use my babies well!
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

KING RICHARD III:
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!

BUCKINGHAM:
My gracious sovereign?

KING RICHARD III:
Give me thy hand.
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
But shall we wear these honours for a day?
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?

BUCKINGHAM:
Still live they and for ever may they last!

KING RICHARD III:
O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
To try if thou be current gold indeed
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.

BUCKINGHAM:
Say on, my loving lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.

KING RICHARD III:
Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
True, noble prince.

KING RICHARD III:
O bitter consequence,
That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.

BUCKINGHAM:
Your grace may do your pleasure.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?

BUCKINGHAM:
Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord
Before I positively herein:
I will resolve your grace immediately.

CATESBY:

KING RICHARD III:
I will converse with iron-witted fools
And unrespective boys: none are for me
That look into me with considerate eyes:
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
Boy!

Page:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?

Page:
My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,
Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
Gold were as good as twenty orators,
And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.

KING RICHARD III:
What is his name?

Page:
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.

KING RICHARD III:
I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
Hath he so long held out with me untired,
And stops he now for breath?
How now! what news with you?

STANLEY:
My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
Where he abides.

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

CATESBY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Rumour it abroad
That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
I will take order for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
About it; for it stands me much upon,
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
I must be married to my brother's daughter,
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
Is thy name Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.

KING RICHARD III:
Art thou, indeed?

TYRREL:
Prove me, my gracious sovereign.

KING RICHARD III:
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?

TYRREL:
Ay, my lord;
But I had rather kill two enemies.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

TYRREL:
Let me have open means to come to them,
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.

KING RICHARD III:
Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
There is no more but so: say it is done,
And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.

TYRREL:
'Tis done, my gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?

TYRREL:
Ye shall, my Lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
The late demand that you did sound me in.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
I hear that news, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
The which you promised I should possess.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.

BUCKINGHAM:
What says your highness to my just demand?

KING RICHARD III:
As I remember, Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
How chance the prophet could not at that time
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, your promise for the earldom,--

KING RICHARD III:
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
Because a bard of Ireland told me once
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM:
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
Of what you promised me.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, but what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon the stroke of ten.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let it strike.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike?

KING RICHARD III:
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein to-day.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut,
Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.

BUCKINGHAM:
Is it even so? rewards he my true service
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!

TYRREL:
The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
The most arch of piteous massacre
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
Within their innocent alabaster arms:
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
The most replenished sweet work of nature,
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
They could not speak; and so I left them both,
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
And here he comes.
All hail, my sovereign liege!

KING RICHARD III:
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?

TYRREL:
If to have done the thing you gave in charge
Beget your happiness, be happy then,
For it is done, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
But didst thou see them dead?

TYRREL:
I did, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
But how or in what place I do not know.

KING RICHARD III:
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
And be inheritor of thy desire.
Farewell till soon.
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.

CATESBY:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?

CATESBY:
Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

KING RICHARD III:
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
Then fiery expedition be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So, now prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
A dire induction am I witness to,
And will to France, hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
Hover about me with your airy wings
And hear your mother's lamentation!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hover about her; say, that right for right
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
So many miseries have crazed my voice,
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?

QUEEN MARGARET:
When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?

QUEEN MARGARET:
If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
Give mine the benefit of seniory,
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can admit society,
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
Young York he is but boot, because both they
Match not the high perfection of my loss:
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
And the beholders of this tragic play,
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
To have him suddenly convey'd away.
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
The presentation of but what I was;
The flattering index of a direful pageant;
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
And left thee but a very prey to time;
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
From which even here I slip my weary neck,
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
These English woes will make me smile in France.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
Compare dead happiness with living woe;
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
And he that slew them fouler than he is:
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why should calamity be full of words?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Windy attorneys to their client woes,
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
Poor breathing orators of miseries!
Let them have scope: though what they do impart
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.

KING RICHARD III:
Who intercepts my expedition?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, she that might have intercepted thee,
By strangling thee in her accursed womb
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
Where should be graven, if that right were right,
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?

KING RICHARD III:
A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
Or with the clamorous report of war
Thus will I drown your exclamations.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou my son?

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Then patiently hear my impatience.

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, let me speak!

KING RICHARD III:
Do then: but I'll not hear.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will be mild and gentle in my speech.

KING RICHARD III:
And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

KING RICHARD III:
And came I not at last to comfort you?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
treacherous,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
What comfortable hour canst thou name,
That ever graced me in thy company?

KING RICHARD III:
Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious in your sight,
Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
Strike the drum.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I prithee, hear me speak.

KING RICHARD III:
You speak too bitterly.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hear me a word;
For I shall never speak to thee again.

KING RICHARD III:
So.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never look upon thy face again.
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
My prayers on the adverse party fight;
And there the little souls of Edward's children
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
And promise them success and victory.
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
Abides in me; I say amen to all.

KING RICHARD III:
Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I have no more sons of the royal blood
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
And therefore level not to hit their lives.

KING RICHARD III:
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And must she die for this? O, let her live,
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
Throw over her the veil of infamy:
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.

KING RICHARD III:
Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.

KING RICHARD III:
Her life is only safest in her birth.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And only in that safety died her brothers.

KING RICHARD III:
Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.

KING RICHARD III:
All unavoided is the doom of destiny.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.

KING RICHARD III:
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars,
As I intend more good to you and yours,
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
To be discover'd, that can do me good?

KING RICHARD III:
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?

KING RICHARD III:
No, to the dignity and height of honour
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?

KING RICHARD III:
Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
Will I withal endow a child of thine;
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.

KING RICHARD III:
Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.

KING RICHARD III:
What do you think?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.

KING RICHARD III:
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
And mean to make her queen of England.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?

KING RICHARD III:
Even he that makes her queen who should be else?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What, thou?

KING RICHARD III:
I, even I: what think you of it, madam?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How canst thou woo her?

KING RICHARD III:
That would I learn of you,
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And wilt thou learn of me?

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, with all my heart.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
If this inducement force her not to love,
Send her a story of thy noble acts;
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

KING RICHARD III:
Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
To win our daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There is no other way
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
And not be Richard that hath done all this.

KING RICHARD III:
Say that I did all this for love of her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.

KING RICHARD III:
Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
Which after hours give leisure to repent.
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
A grandam's name is little less in love
Than is the doting title of a mother;
They are as children but one step below,
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
Your children were vexation to your youth,
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
The loss you have is but a son being king,
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
I cannot make you what amends I would,
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
To high promotions and great dignity:
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
Again shall you be mother to a king,
And all the ruins of distressful times
Repair'd with double riches of content.
What! we have many goodly days to see:
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
Advantaging their loan with interest
Of ten times double gain of happiness.
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
To whom I will retail my conquest won,
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What were I best to say? her father's brother
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
Under what title shall I woo for thee,
That God, the law, my honour and her love,
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?

KING RICHARD III:
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.

KING RICHARD III:
Say that the king, which may command, entreats.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands which the king's King forbids.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To wail the tide, as her mother doth.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I will love her everlastingly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long shall that title 'ever' last?

KING RICHARD III:
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?

KING RICHARD III:
So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So long as hell and Richard likes of it.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.

KING RICHARD III:
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.

KING RICHARD III:
Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.

KING RICHARD III:
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.

KING RICHARD III:
Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.

KING RICHARD III:
I swear--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By nothing; for this is no oath:
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by the world--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.

KING RICHARD III:
My father's death--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thy life hath that dishonour'd.

KING RICHARD III:
Then, by myself--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thyself thyself misusest.

KING RICHARD III:
Why then, by God--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God's wrong is most of all.
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The unity the king thy brother made
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
Had graced the tender temples of my child,
And both the princes had been breathing here,
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
What canst thou swear by now?

KING RICHARD III:
The time to come.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
For I myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
The children live, whose parents thou hast
slaughter'd,
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.

KING RICHARD III:
As I intend to prosper and repent,
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
In her consists my happiness and thine;
Without her, follows to this land and me,
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
It cannot be avoided but by this;
It will not be avoided but by this.
Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
Be the attorney of my love to her:
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
Urge the necessity and state of times,
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I forget myself to be myself?

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But thou didst kill my children.

KING RICHARD III:
But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

KING RICHARD III:
And be a happy mother by the deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I go. Write to me very shortly.
And you shall understand from me her mind.

KING RICHARD III:
Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
How now! what news?

RATCLIFF:
My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
And there they hull, expecting but the aid
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.

KING RICHARD III:
Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?

CATESBY:
Here, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Fly to the duke:
Post thou to Salisbury
When thou comest thither--
Dull, unmindful villain,
Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?

CATESBY:
First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.

KING RICHARD III:
O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
The greatest strength and power he can make,
And meet me presently at Salisbury.

CATESBY:
I go.

RATCLIFF:
What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
Salisbury?

KING RICHARD III:
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?

RATCLIFF:
Your highness told me I should post before.

KING RICHARD III:
My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
How now, what news with you?

STANLEY:
None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.

KING RICHARD III:
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou run so many mile about,
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
Once more, what news?

STANLEY:
Richmond is on the seas.

KING RICHARD III:
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?

STANLEY:
I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?

STANLEY:
Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
He makes for England, there to claim the crown.

KING RICHARD III:
Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
What heir of York is there alive but we?
And who is England's king but great York's heir?
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?

STANLEY:
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.

KING RICHARD III:
Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.

STANLEY:
No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.

KING RICHARD III:
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not now upon the western shore.
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!

STANLEY:
No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.

KING RICHARD III:
Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?

STANLEY:
They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
Please it your majesty to give me leave,
I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
Where and what time your majesty shall please.

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
I will not trust you, sir.

STANLEY:
Most mighty sovereign,
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
I never was nor never will be false.

KING RICHARD III:
Well,
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.

STANLEY:
So deal with him as I prove true to you.

Messenger:
My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
As I by friends am well advertised,
Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate
Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,
With many more confederates, are in arms.

Second Messenger:
My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
And every hour more competitors
Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.

Third Messenger:
My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--

KING RICHARD III:
Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?
Take that, until thou bring me better news.

Third Messenger:
The news I have to tell your majesty
Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;
And he himself wander'd away alone,
No man knows whither.

KING RICHARD III:
I cry thee mercy:
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
Reward to him that brings the traitor in?

Third Messenger:
Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.

Fourth Messenger:
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
If they were his assistants, yea or no;
Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.
Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.

KING RICHARD III:
March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
If not to fight with foreign enemies,
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

CATESBY:
My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.

KING RICHARD III:
Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
A royal battle might be won and lost
Some one take order Buckingham be brought
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.

DERBY:
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
That in the sty of this most bloody boar
My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
The fear of that withholds my present aid.
But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?

CHRISTOPHER:
At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
What men of name resort to him?

CHRISTOPHER:
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
And many more of noble fame and worth:
And towards London they do bend their course,
If by the way they be not fought withal.

DERBY:
Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:
Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.

BUCKINGHAM:
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?

Sheriff:
No, my good lord; therefore be patient.

BUCKINGHAM:
Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
If that your moody discontented souls
Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
Even for revenge mock my destruction!
This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?

Sheriff:
It is, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
False to his children or his wife's allies
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
By the false faith of him I trusted most;
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
That high All-Seer that I dallied with
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.

RICHMOND:
Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Have we march'd on without impediment;
And here receive we from our father Stanley
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.

OXFORD:
Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
To fight against that bloody homicide.

HERBERT:
I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.

BLUNT:
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.

RICHMOND:
All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.

KING RICHARD III:
Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?

SURREY:
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.

KING RICHARD III:
My Lord of Norfolk,--

NORFOLK:
Here, most gracious liege.

KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?

NORFOLK:
We must both give and take, my gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.
Who hath descried the number of the foe?

NORFOLK:
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, our battalion trebles that account:
Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
Which they upon the adverse party want.
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
Let us survey the vantage of the field
Call for some men of sound direction
Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.

RICHMOND:
The weary sun hath made a golden set,
And by the bright track of his fiery car,
Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
Give me some ink and paper in my tent
I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
Limit each leader to his several charge,
And part in just proportion our small strength.
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him
And by the second hour in the morning
Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?

BLUNT:
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
Which well I am assured I have not done,
His regiment lies half a mile at least
South from the mighty power of the king.

RICHMOND:
If without peril it be possible,
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
And give him from me this most needful scroll.

BLUNT:
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!

RICHMOND:
Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.

KING RICHARD III:
What is't o'clock?

CATESBY:
It's supper-time, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

KING RICHARD III:
I will not sup to-night.
Give me some ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armour laid into my tent?

CATESBY:
If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.

KING RICHARD III:
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.

NORFOLK:
I go, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.

NORFOLK:
I warrant you, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

CATESBY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Send out a pursuivant at arms
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?

RATCLIFF:
Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.

KING RICHARD III:
So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
I have not that alacrity of spirit,
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

RATCLIFF:
It is, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Bid my guard watch; leave me.
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.

DERBY:
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!

RICHMOND:
All comfort that the dark night can afford
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?

DERBY:
I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother
Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
With best advantage will deceive the time,
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
But on thy side I may not be too forward
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
Be executed in his father's sight.
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
God give us leisure for these rites of love!
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!

RICHMOND:
Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
When I should mount with wings of victory:
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
That they may crush down with a heavy fall
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
That we may praise thee in the victory!
To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!

Ghost of Prince Edward:

Ghost of King Henry VI:

Ghost of CLARENCE:

Ghost of RIVERS:

Ghost of GREY:

Ghost of VAUGHAN:

All:

Ghost of HASTINGS:

Ghosts of young Princes:

Ghost of LADY ANNE:

Ghost of BUCKINGHAM:

KING RICHARD III:
Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
That I myself have done unto myself?
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree
Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
All several sins, all used in each degree,
Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
Find in myself no pity to myself?
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
Came to my tent; and every one did threat
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

RATCLIFF:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
'Zounds! who is there?

RATCLIFF:
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?

RATCLIFF:
No doubt, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--

RATCLIFF:
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.

KING RICHARD III:
By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
To see if any mean to shrink from me.

LORDS:
Good morrow, Richmond!

RICHMOND:
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

LORDS:
How have you slept, my lord?

RICHMOND:
The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
Have I since your departure had, my lords.
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
I promise you, my soul is very jocund
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
How far into the morning is it, lords?

LORDS:
Upon the stroke of four.

RICHMOND:
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
More than I have said, loving countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
God and our good cause fight upon our side;
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
Richard except, those whom we fight against
Had rather have us win than him they follow:
For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
One that made means to come by what he hath,
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
One that hath ever been God's enemy:
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
If you do fight against your country's foes,
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
If you do free your children from the sword,
Your children's children quit it in your age.
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!

KING RICHARD III:
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?

RATCLIFF:
That he was never trained up in arms.

KING RICHARD III:
He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?

RATCLIFF:
He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'

KING RICHARD III:
He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
Who saw the sun to-day?

RATCLIFF:
Not I, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
He should have braved the east an hour ago
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
The sun will not be seen to-day;
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

NORFOLK:
Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.

KING RICHARD III:
Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
And thus my battle shall be ordered:
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
Consisting equally of horse and foot;
Our archers shall be placed in the midst
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
They thus directed, we will follow
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?

NORFOLK:
A good direction, warlike sovereign.
This found I on my tent this morning.

KING RICHARD III:

Messenger:
My lord, he doth deny to come.

KING RICHARD III:
Off with his son George's head!

NORFOLK:
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh
After the battle let George Stanley die.

KING RICHARD III:
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
Advance our standards, set upon our foes
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.

CATESBY:
Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
Daring an opposite to every danger:
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!

KING RICHARD III:
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

CATESBY:
Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.

KING RICHARD III:
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
And I will stand the hazard of the die:
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

RICHMOND:
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.

DERBY:
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

RICHMOND:
Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?

DERBY:
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.

RICHMOND:
What men of name are slain on either side?

DERBY:
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.

RICHMOND:
Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
That in submission will return to us:
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
We will unite the white rose and the red:
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
All this divided York and Lancaster,
Divided in their dire division,
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
The true succeeders of each royal house,
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
That would reduce these bloody days again,
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
Let them not live to taste this land's increase
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
That she may long live here, God say amen!

KING RICHARD II:
Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I have, my liege.

KING RICHARD II:
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
On some known ground of treachery in him?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
As near as I could sift him on that argument,
On some apparent danger seen in him
Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.

KING RICHARD II:
Then call them to our presence; face to face,
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
The accuser and the accused freely speak:
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Many years of happy days befal
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Each day still better other's happiness;
Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
Add an immortal title to your crown!

KING RICHARD II:
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
As well appeareth by the cause you come;
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
First, heaven be the record to my speech!
In the devotion of a subject's love,
Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
And free from other misbegotten hate,
Come I appellant to this princely presence.
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
My body shall make good upon this earth,
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
Too good to be so and too bad to live,
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
Which else would post until it had return'd
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
I do defy him, and I spit at him;
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
Or any other ground inhabitable,
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
I take it up; and by that sword I swear
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
And when I mount, alive may I not light,
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!

KING RICHARD II:
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
It must be great that can inherit us
So much as of a thought of ill in him.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
Besides I say and will in battle prove,
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
That ever was survey'd by English eye,
That all the treasons for these eighteen years
Complotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
Further I say and further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make all this good,
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
And consequently, like a traitor coward,
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
To me for justice and rough chastisement;
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.

KING RICHARD II:
How high a pitch his resolution soars!
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
O, let my sovereign turn away his face
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
Till I have told this slander of his blood,
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.

KING RICHARD II:
Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
As he is but my father's brother's son,
Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
The other part reserved I by consent,
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
Upon remainder of a dear account,
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
The honourable father to my foe
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
But ere I last received the sacrament
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,
It issues from the rancour of a villain,
A recreant and most degenerate traitor
Which in myself I boldly will defend;
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
To prove myself a loyal gentleman
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
Your highness to assign our trial day.

KING RICHARD II:
Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
This we prescribe, though no physician;
Deep malice makes too deep incision;
Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
To be a make-peace shall become my age:
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.

KING RICHARD II:
And, Norfolk, throw down his.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
When, Harry, when?
Obedience bids I should not bid again.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
Which breathed this poison.

KING RICHARD II:
Rage must be withstood:
Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
The purest treasure mortal times afford
Is spotless reputation: that away,
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
Take honour from me, and my life is done:
Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
In that I live and for that will I die.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting fear,
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.

KING RICHARD II:
We were not born to sue, but to command;
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
The swelling difference of your settled hate:
Since we can not atone you, we shall see
Justice design the victor's chivalry.
Lord marshal, command our officers at arms
Be ready to direct these home alarms.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
To stir against the butchers of his life!
But since correction lieth in those hands
Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.

DUCHESS:
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,
By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
In some large measure to thy father's death,
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
Who was the model of thy father's life.
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
That which in mean men we intitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
His deputy anointed in His sight,
Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
An angry arm against His minister.

DUCHESS:
Where then, alas, may I complain myself?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
To God, the widow's champion and defence.

DUCHESS:
Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
They may break his foaming courser's back,
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
With her companion grief must end her life.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
As much good stay with thee as go with me!

DUCHESS:
Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
I take my leave before I have begun,
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
Alack, and what shall good old York there see
But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

Lord Marshal:
My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.

Lord Marshal:
The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,
Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay
For nothing but his majesty's approach.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms:
Ask him his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
In God's name and the king's, say who thou art
And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,
Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:
Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
Who hither come engaged by my oath--
Which God defend a knight should violate!--
Both to defend my loyalty and truth
To God, my king and my succeeding issue,
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me
And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
To prove him, in defending of myself,
A traitor to my God, my king, and me:
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
Both who he is and why he cometh hither
Thus plated in habiliments of war,
And formally, according to our law,
Depose him in the justice of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,
Before King Richard in his royal lists?
Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!

Lord Marshal:
On pain of death, no person be so bold
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
Except the marshal and such officers
Appointed to direct these fair designs.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
And bow my knee before his majesty:
For Mowbray and myself are like two men
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;
Then let us take a ceremonious leave
And loving farewell of our several friends.

Lord Marshal:
The appellant in all duty greets your highness,
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.

KING RICHARD II:
We will descend and fold him in our arms.
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O let no noble eye profane a tear
For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:
As confident as is the falcon's flight
Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
Not sick, although I have to do with death,
But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:
O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
To reach at victory above my head,
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,
And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,
Even in the lusty havior of his son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
Be swift like lightning in the execution;
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
However God or fortune cast my lot,
There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,
A loyal, just and upright gentleman:
Never did captive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
This feast of battle with mine adversary.
Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
As gentle and as jocund as to jest
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, my lord: securely I espy
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
Order the trial, marshal, and begin.

Lord Marshal:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.

Lord Marshal:
Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.

First Herald:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,
On pain to be found false and recreant,
To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
A traitor to his God, his king and him;
And dares him to set forward to the fight.

Second Herald:
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
On pain to be found false and recreant,
Both to defend himself and to approve
Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;
Courageously and with a free desire
Attending but the signal to begin.

Lord Marshal:
Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.

KING RICHARD II:
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
And both return back to their chairs again:
Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound
While we return these dukes what we decree.
Draw near,
And list what with our council we have done.
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
And for we think the eagle-winged pride
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
With rival-hating envy, set on you
To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,
With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,
Therefore, we banish you our territories:
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Your will be done: this must my comfort be,
Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;
And those his golden beams to you here lent
Shall point on me and gild my banishment.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
The sly slow hours shall not determinate
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
The hopeless word of 'never to return'
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
As to be cast forth in the common air,
Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
The language I have learn'd these forty years,
My native English, now I must forego:
And now my tongue's use is to me no more
Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
Or like a cunning instrument cased up,
Or, being open, put into his hands
That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
Too far in years to be a pupil now:
What is thy sentence then but speechless death,
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?

KING RICHARD II:
It boots thee not to be compassionate:
After our sentence plaining comes too late.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then thus I turn me from my country's light,
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.

KING RICHARD II:
Return again, and take an oath with thee.
Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;
Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
To keep the oath that we administer:
You never shall, so help you truth and God!
Embrace each other's love in banishment;
Nor never look upon each other's face;
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
Nor never by advised purpose meet
To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I swear.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
And I, to keep all this.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--
By this time, had the king permitted us,
One of our souls had wander'd in the air.
Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,
As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
Since thou hast far to go, bear not along
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
My name be blotted from the book of life,
And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;
And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
Save back to England, all the world's my way.

KING RICHARD II:
Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
Hath from the number of his banish'd years
Pluck'd four away.
Six frozen winter spent,
Return with welcome home from banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How long a time lies in one little word!
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
End in a word: such is the breath of kings.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I thank my liege, that in regard of me
He shortens four years of my son's exile:
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
For, ere the six years that he hath to spend
Can change their moons and bring their times about
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
And blindfold death not let me see my son.

KING RICHARD II:
Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;
Thy word is current with him for my death,
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.

KING RICHARD II:
Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather
You would have bid me argue like a father.
O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.
Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
I was too strict to make mine own away;
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
Against my will to do myself this wrong.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:
Six years we banish him, and he shall go.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
From where you do remain let paper show.

Lord Marshal:
My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
As far as land will let me, by your side.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I have too few to take my leave of you,
When the tongue's office should be prodigal
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Joy absent, grief is present for that time.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
What is six winters? they are quickly gone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
The sullen passage of thy weary steps
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
The precious jewel of thy home return.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
Will but remember me what a deal of world
I wander from the jewels that I love.
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages, and in the end,
Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
But that I was a journeyman to grief?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
All places that the eye of heaven visits
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
Teach thy necessity to reason thus;
There is no virtue like necessity.
Think not the king did banish thee,
But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
And not the king exiled thee; or suppose
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:
Suppose the singing birds musicians,
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,
The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
Than a delightful measure or a dance;
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
The man that mocks at it and sets it light.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, who can hold a fire in his hand
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
By bare imagination of a feast?
Or wallow naked in December snow
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
O, no! the apprehension of the good
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:
Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,
Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.

KING RICHARD II:
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the next highway, and there I left him.

KING RICHARD II:
And say, what store of parting tears were shed?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.

KING RICHARD II:
What said our cousin when you parted with him?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
'Farewell:'
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
And added years to his short banishment,
He should have had a volume of farewells;
But since it would not, he had none of me.

KING RICHARD II:
He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
When time shall call him home from banishment,
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
Observed his courtship to the common people;
How he did seem to dive into their hearts
With humble and familiar courtesy,
What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
And patient underbearing of his fortune,
As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
And had the tribute of his supple knee,
With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
As were our England in reversion his,
And he our subjects' next degree in hope.

GREEN:
Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
Ere further leisure yield them further means
For their advantage and your highness' loss.

KING RICHARD II:
We will ourself in person to this war:
And, for our coffers, with too great a court
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
For our affairs in hand: if that come short,
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
And send them after to supply our wants;
For we will make for Ireland presently.
Bushy, what news?

BUSHY:
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
To entreat your majesty to visit him.

KING RICHARD II:
Where lies he?

BUSHY:
At Ely House.

KING RICHARD II:
Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
To help him to his grave immediately!
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!

All:
Amen.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Will the king come, that I may breathe my last
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?

DUKE OF YORK:
Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, but they say the tongues of dying men
Enforce attention like deep harmony:
Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
He that no more must say is listen'd more
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
The setting sun, and music at the close,
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
Writ in remembrance more than things long past:
Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,
My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.

DUKE OF YORK:
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,
As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
The open ear of youth doth always listen;
Report of fashions in proud Italy,
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation.
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
And thus expiring do foretell of him:
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war,
This happy breed of men, this little world,
This precious stone set in the silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against the envy of less happier lands,
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
For Christian service and true chivalry,
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,
This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
Dear for her reputation through the world,
Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,
Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
England, bound in with the triumphant sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
That England, that was wont to conquer others,
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
How happy then were my ensuing death!

DUKE OF YORK:
The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.

QUEEN:
How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?

KING RICHARD II:
What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O how that name befits my composition!
Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;
Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;
And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:
Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.

KING RICHARD II:
Can sick men play so nicely with their names?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.

KING RICHARD II:
Should dying men flatter with those that live?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, no, men living flatter those that die.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.

KING RICHARD II:
I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;
And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.
O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,
Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.
Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
It were a shame to let this land by lease;
But for thy world enjoying but this land,
Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
Landlord of England art thou now, not king:
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--

KING RICHARD II:
A lunatic lean-witted fool,
Presuming on an ague's privilege,
Darest with thy frozen admonition
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
With fury from his native residence.
Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,
Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
For that I was his father Edward's son;
That blood already, like the pelican,
Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!
May be a precedent and witness good
That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:
Join with the present sickness that I have;
And thy unkindness be like crooked age,
To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:
Love they to live that love and honour have.

KING RICHARD II:
And let them die that age and sullens have;
For both hast thou, and both become the grave.

DUKE OF YORK:
I do beseech your majesty, impute his words
To wayward sickliness and age in him:
He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.

KING RICHARD II:
Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;
As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.

KING RICHARD II:
What says he?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, nothing; all is said
His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.

DUKE OF YORK:
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

KING RICHARD II:
The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
Which live like venom where no venom else
But only they have privilege to live.
And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
Towards our assistance we do seize to us
The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
In war was never lion raged more fierce,
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
Than was that young and princely gentleman.
His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,
Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;
But when he frown'd, it was against the French
And not against his friends; his noble hand
Did will what he did spend and spent not that
Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
Or else he never would compare between.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, uncle, what's the matter?

DUKE OF YORK:
O my liege,
Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time
His charters and his customary rights;
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
But by fair sequence and succession?
Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,
Call in the letters patent that he hath
By his attorneys-general to sue
His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
Which honour and allegiance cannot think.

KING RICHARD II:
Think what you will, we seize into our hands
His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.

DUKE OF YORK:
I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:
What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;
But by bad courses may be understood
That their events can never fall out good.

KING RICHARD II:
Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
Bid him repair to us to Ely House
To see this business. To-morrow next
We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:
And we create, in absence of ourself,
Our uncle York lord governor of England;
For he is just and always loved us well.
Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;
Be merry, for our time of stay is short

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.

LORD ROSS:
And living too; for now his son is duke.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Barely in title, not in revenue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if justice had her right.

LORD ROSS:
My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
If it be so, out with it boldly, man;
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.

LORD ROSS:
No good at all that I can do for him;
Unless you call it good to pity him,
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
In him, a royal prince, and many moe
Of noble blood in this declining land.
The king is not himself, but basely led
By flatterers; and what they will inform,
Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,
That will the king severely prosecute
'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.

LORD ROSS:
The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,
And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined
For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And daily new exactions are devised,
As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:
But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
But basely yielded upon compromise
That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.

LORD ROSS:
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.

LORD ROSS:
He hath not money for these Irish wars,
His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,
But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
And yet we strike not, but securely perish.

LORD ROSS:
We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
And unavoided is the danger now,
For suffering so the causes of our wreck.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
I spy life peering; but I dare not say
How near the tidings of our comfort is.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.

LORD ROSS:
Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,
Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
In Brittany, received intelligence
That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,
All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne
With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
Are making hither with all due expedience
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
The first departing of the king for Ireland.
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
And make high majesty look like itself,
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
Stay and be secret, and myself will go.

LORD ROSS:
To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.

BUSHY:
Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
You promised, when you parted with the king,
To lay aside life-harming heaviness
And entertain a cheerful disposition.

QUEEN:
To please the king I did; to please myself
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,
Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
More than with parting from my lord the king.

BUSHY:
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
Divides one thing entire to many objects;
Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.

QUEEN:
It may be so; but yet my inward soul
Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.

BUSHY:
'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.

QUEEN:
'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
For nothing had begot my something grief;
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
But what it is, that is not yet known; what
I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.

GREEN:
God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:
I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.

QUEEN:
Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?

GREEN:
That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
At Ravenspurgh.

QUEEN:
Now God in heaven forbid!

GREEN:
Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.

BUSHY:
Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
And all the rest revolted faction traitors?

GREEN:
We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
And all the household servants fled with him
To Bolingbroke.

QUEEN:
So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,
Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.

BUSHY:
Despair not, madam.

QUEEN:
Who shall hinder me?
I will despair, and be at enmity
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
A parasite, a keeper back of death,
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
Which false hope lingers in extremity.

GREEN:
Here comes the Duke of York.

QUEEN:
With signs of war about his aged neck:
O, full of careful business are his looks!
Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.

DUKE OF YORK:
Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
Here am I left to underprop his land,
Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;
Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.

Servant:
My lord, your son was gone before I came.

DUKE OF YORK:
He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,
And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
Hold, take my ring.

Servant:
My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
To-day, as I came by, I called there;
But I shall grieve you to report the rest.

DUKE OF YORK:
What is't, knave?

Servant:
An hour before I came, the duchess died.

DUKE OF YORK:
God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
I know not what to do: I would to God,
So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
How shall we do for money for these wars?
Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.
Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
And bring away the armour that is there.
Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
If I know how or which way to order these affairs
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,
Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
And duty bids defend; the other again
Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
Dispose of you.
Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
And meet me presently at Berkeley.
I should to Plashy too;
But time will not permit: all is uneven,
And every thing is left at six and seven.

BUSHY:
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
But none returns. For us to levy power
Proportionable to the enemy
Is all unpossible.

GREEN:
Besides, our nearness to the king in love
Is near the hate of those love not the king.

BAGOT:
And that's the wavering commons: for their love
Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.

BUSHY:
Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.

BAGOT:
If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
Because we ever have been near the king.

GREEN:
Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.

BUSHY:
Thither will I with you; for little office
The hateful commons will perform for us,
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
Will you go along with us?

BAGOT:
No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.

BUSHY:
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.

GREEN:
Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.

BUSHY:
Well, we may meet again.

BAGOT:
I fear me, never.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Believe me, noble lord,
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
But I bethink me what a weary way
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
The tediousness and process of my travel:
But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
The present benefit which I possess;
And hope to joy is little less in joy
Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
By sight of what I have, your noble company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Of much less value is my company
Than your good words. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my son, young Harry Percy,
Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
Harry, how fares your uncle?

HENRY PERCY:
I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Why, is he not with the queen?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
Broken his staff of office and dispersed
The household of the king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What was his reason?
He was not so resolved when last we spake together.

HENRY PERCY:
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,
And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover
What power the Duke of York had levied there;
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,
I never in my life did look on him.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.

HENRY PERCY:
My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
To more approved service and desert.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
I count myself in nothing else so happy
As in a soul remembering my good friends;
And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,
It shall be still thy true love's recompense:
My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
Keeps good old York there with his men of war?

HENRY PERCY:
There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
None else of name and noble estimate.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
A banish'd traitor: all my treasury
Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd
Shall be your love and labour's recompense.

LORD ROSS:
Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And far surmounts our labour to attain it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.

LORD BERKELEY:
My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
And I am come to seek that name in England;
And I must find that title in your tongue,
Before I make reply to aught you say.

LORD BERKELEY:
Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
To raze one title of your honour out:
To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,
From the most gracious regent of this land,
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
To take advantage of the absent time
And fright our native peace with self-born arms.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I shall not need transport my words by you;
Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!

DUKE OF YORK:
Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
Whose duty is deceiveable and false.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious uncle--

DUKE OF YORK:
Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
And ostentation of despised arms?
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
And minister correction to thy fault!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
On what condition stands it and wherein?

DUKE OF YORK:
Even in condition of the worst degree,
In gross rebellion and detested treason:
Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come
Before the expiration of thy time,
In braving arms against thy sovereign.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
You are my father, for methinks in you
I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
If that my cousin king be King of England,
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
I am denied to sue my livery here,
And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
What would you have me do? I am a subject,
And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;
And therefore, personally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free descent.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke hath been too much abused.

LORD ROSS:
It stands your grace upon to do him right.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Base men by his endowments are made great.

DUKE OF YORK:
My lords of England, let me tell you this:
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
And laboured all I could to do him right;
But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
Be his own carver and cut out his way,
To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
And you that do abet him in this kind
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own; and for the right of that
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
Because my power is weak and all ill left:
But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
I would attach you all and make you stoop
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
But since I cannot, be it known to you
I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
Unless you please to enter in the castle
And there repose you for this night.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
But we must win your grace to go with us
To Bristol castle, which they say is held
By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.

DUKE OF YORK:
It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
For I am loath to break our country's laws.
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
Things past redress are now with me past care.

Captain:
My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,
And hardly kept our countrymen together,
And yet we hear no tidings from the king;
Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.

Captain:
'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;
The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
The other to enjoy by rage and war:
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,
As well assured Richard their king is dead.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind
I see thy glory like a shooting star
Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bring forth these men.
Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
Since presently your souls must part your bodies--
With too much urging your pernicious lives,
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
From off my hands, here in the view of men
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
You have misled a prince, a royal king,
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
You have in manner with your sinful hours
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
Broke the possession of a royal bed
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
Near to the king in blood, and near in love
Till you did make him misinterpret me,
Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
From my own windows torn my household coat,
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
Save men's opinions and my living blood,
To show the world I am a gentleman.
This and much more, much more than twice all this,
Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over
To execution and the hand of death.

BUSHY:
More welcome is the stroke of death to me
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.

GREEN:
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;
For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:
Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
With letters of your love to her at large.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
To fight with Glendower and his complices:
Awhile to work, and after holiday.

KING RICHARD II:
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?

KING RICHARD II:
Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
To stand upon my kingdom once again.
Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
As a long-parted mother with her child
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
And do thee favours with my royal hands.
Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
The proffer'd means of succor and redress.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
Grows strong and great in substance and in power.

KING RICHARD II:
Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his light through every guilty hole,
Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
Not able to endure the sight of day,
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
The breath of worldly men cannot depose
The deputy elected by the Lord:
For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.
Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?

KING RICHARD II:
But now the blood of twenty thousand men
Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
And, till so much blood thither come again,
Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
All souls that will be safe fly from my side,
For time hath set a blot upon my pride.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.

KING RICHARD II:
I had forgot myself; am I not king?
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
More health and happiness betide my liege
Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!

KING RICHARD II:
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
And what loss is it to be rid of care?
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
They break their faith to God as well as us:
Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
The worst is death, and death will have his day.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
To bear the tidings of calamity.
Like an unseasonable stormy day,
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
So high above his limits swells the rage
Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.

KING RICHARD II:
Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
That they have let the dangerous enemy
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
Upon their spotted souls for this offence!

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the duke my father with his power?

KING RICHARD II:
No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
And nothing can we call our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
As if this flesh which walls about our life,
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,
For you have but mistook me all this while:
I live with bread like you, feel want,
Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
How can you say to me, I am a king?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
But presently prevent the ways to wail.
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
And so your follies fight against yourself.
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
And fight and die is death destroying death;
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My father hath a power; inquire of him
And learn to make a body of a limb.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
An easy task it is to win our own.
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Men judge by the complexion of the sky
The state and inclination of the day:
So may you by my dull and heavy eye,
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
I play the torturer, by small and small
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,
And all your northern castles yielded up,
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his party.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou hast said enough.
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
What say you now? what comfort have we now?
By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
That bids me be of comfort any more.
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
That power I have, discharge; and let them go
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
For I have none: let no man speak again
To alter this, for counsel is but vain.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My liege, one word.

KING RICHARD II:
He does me double wrong
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
Discharge my followers: let them hence away,
From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So that by this intelligence we learn
The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury
Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
With some few private friends upon this coast.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The news is very fair and good, my lord:
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.

DUKE OF YORK:
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day
When such a sacred king should hide his head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief
Left I his title out.

DUKE OF YORK:
The time hath been,
Would you have been so brief with him, he would
Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,
For taking so the head, your whole head's length.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.

DUKE OF YORK:
Take not, good cousin, further than you should.
Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
Against their will. But who comes here?
Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?

HENRY PERCY:
The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
Against thy entrance.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Royally!
Why, it contains no king?

HENRY PERCY:
Yes, my good lord,
It doth contain a king; King Richard lies
Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Noble lords,
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
Henry Bolingbroke
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
To his most royal person, hither come
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
Provided that my banishment repeal'd
And lands restored again be freely granted:
If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
Go, signify as much, while here we march
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,
That from this castle's tatter'd battlements
Our fair appointments may be well perused.
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
With no less terror than the elements
Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,
As doth the blushing discontented sun
From out the fiery portal of the east,
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
To dim his glory and to stain the track
Of his bright passage to the occident.

DUKE OF YORK:
Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth
Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,
That any harm should stain so fair a show!

KING RICHARD II:
We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
To pay their awful duty to our presence?
If we be not, show us the hand of God
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
And though you think that all, as you have done,
Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
And we are barren and bereft of friends;
Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
That lift your vassal hands against my head
And threat the glory of my precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
That every stride he makes upon my land
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
The purple testament of bleeding war;
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
Shall ill become the flower of England's face,
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
To scarlet indignation and bedew
Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
Should so with civil and uncivil arms
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
And by the honourable tomb he swears,
That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,
And by the royalties of both your bloods,
Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
And by the worth and honour of himself,
Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
His coming hither hath no further scope
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:
Which on thy royal party granted once,
His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
To faithful service of your majesty.
This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;
And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
His noble cousin is right welcome hither;
And all the number of his fair demands
Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:
With all the gracious utterance thou hast
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
Defiance to the traitor, and so die?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.

KING RICHARD II:
O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,
That laid the sentence of dread banishment
On yon proud man, should take it off again
With words of sooth! O that I were as great
As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
Or that I could forget what I have been,
Or not remember what I must be now!
Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
What must the king do now? must he submit?
The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
The king shall be contented: must he lose
The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
My subjects for a pair of carved saints
And my large kingdom for a little grave,
A little little grave, an obscure grave;
Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,
Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
And buried once, why not upon my head?
Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!
We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
And make a dearth in this revolting land.
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
As thus, to drop them still upon one place,
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies
Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, in the base court he doth attend
To speak with you; may it please you to come down.

KING RICHARD II:
Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,
Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
should sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What says his majesty?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Sorrow and grief of heart
Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man
Yet he is come.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Stand all apart,
And show fair duty to his majesty.
My gracious lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
Me rather had my heart might feel your love
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
Thus high at least, although your knee be low.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.

KING RICHARD II:
Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
As my true service shall deserve your love.

KING RICHARD II:
Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,
That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
Though you are old enough to be my heir.
What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;
For do we must what force will have us do.
Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yea, my good lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Then I must not say no.

QUEEN:
What sport shall we devise here in this garden,
To drive away the heavy thought of care?

Lady:
Madam, we'll play at bowls.

QUEEN:
'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
And that my fortune rubs against the bias.

Lady:
Madam, we'll dance.

QUEEN:
My legs can keep no measure in delight,
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.

Lady:
Madam, we'll tell tales.

QUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?

Lady:
Of either, madam.

QUEEN:
Of neither, girl:
For of joy, being altogether wanting,
It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
Or if of grief, being altogether had,
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
For what I have I need not to repeat;
And what I want it boots not to complain.

Lady:
Madam, I'll sing.

QUEEN:
'Tis well that thou hast cause
But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.

Lady:
I could weep, madam, would it do you good.

QUEEN:
And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
And never borrow any tear of thee.
But stay, here come the gardeners:
Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
They'll talk of state; for every one doth so
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.

Gardener:
Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
Which, like unruly children, make their sire
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
Go thou, and like an executioner,
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
All must be even in our government.
You thus employ'd, I will go root away
The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.

Servant:
Why should we in the compass of a pale
Keep law and form and due proportion,
Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,
Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
Swarming with caterpillars?

Gardener:
Hold thy peace:
He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,
Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.

Servant:
What, are they dead?

Gardener:
They are; and Bolingbroke
Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it
That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
As we this garden! We at time of year
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,
Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
With too much riches it confound itself:
Had he done so to great and growing men,
They might have lived to bear and he to taste
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:
Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.

Servant:
What, think you then the king shall be deposed?

Gardener:
Depress'd he is already, and deposed
'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,
That tell black tidings.

QUEEN:
O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
To make a second fall of cursed man?
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.

Gardener:
Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
King Richard, he is in the mighty hold
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:
In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
And some few vanities that make him light;
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
Besides himself, are all the English peers,
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
Post you to London, and you will find it so;
I speak no more than every one doth know.

QUEEN:
Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st
To serve me last, that I may longest keep
Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,
To meet at London London's king in woe.
What, was I born to this, that my sad look
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,
Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.

GARDENER:
Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
Here did she fall a tear; here in this place
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:
Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,
In the remembrance of a weeping queen.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Call forth Bagot.
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd
The bloody office of his timeless end.

BAGOT:
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.

BAGOT:
My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
That reacheth from the restful English court
As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
Amongst much other talk, that very time,
I heard you say that you had rather refuse
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
Adding withal how blest this land would be
In this your cousin's death.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Princes and noble lords,
What answer shall I make to this base man?
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
On equal terms to give him chastisement?
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting one, I would he were the best
In all this presence that hath moved me so.

LORD FITZWATER:
If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.

LORD FITZWATER:
Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.

HENRY PERCY:
Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
To prove it on thee to the extremest point
Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
An if I do not, may my hands rot off
And never brandish more revengeful steel
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!

Lord:
I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
And spur thee on with full as many lies
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
To answer twenty thousand such as you.

DUKE OF SURREY:
My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
The very time Aumerle and you did talk.

LORD FITZWATER:
'Tis very true: you were in presence then;
And you can witness with me this is true.

DUKE OF SURREY:
As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.

LORD FITZWATER:
Surrey, thou liest.

DUKE OF SURREY:
Dishonourable boy!
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
That it shall render vengeance and revenge
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.

LORD FITZWATER:
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,
And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,
To tie thee to my strong correction.
As I intend to thrive in this new world,
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
To execute the noble duke at Calais.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,
If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
These differences shall all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,
And, though mine enemy, restored again
To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
To Italy; and there at Venice gave
His body to that pleasant country's earth,
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
Under whose colours he had fought so long.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
As surely as I live, my lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,
Your differences shall all rest under gage
Till we assign you to your days of trial.

DUKE OF YORK:
Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
To the possession of thy royal hand:
Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
And long live Henry, fourth of that name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Marry. God forbid!
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
Would God that any in this noble presence
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
What subject can give sentence on his king?
And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
And shall the figure of God's majesty,
His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
Be judged by subject and inferior breath,
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
That in a Christian climate souls refined
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
The blood of English shall manure the ground,
And future ages groan for this foul act;
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
O, if you raise this house against this house,
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
Of capital treason we arrest you here.
My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
To keep him safely till his day of trial.
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
He may surrender; so we shall proceed
Without suspicion.

DUKE OF YORK:
I will be his conduct.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
Little are we beholding to your love,
And little look'd for at your helping hands.

KING RICHARD II:
Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
To this submission. Yet I well remember
The favours of these men: were they not mine?
Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?
So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,
Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.
God save the king! Will no man say amen?
Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.
God save the king! although I be not he;
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.
To do what service am I sent for hither?

DUKE OF YORK:
To do that office of thine own good will
Which tired majesty did make thee offer,
The resignation of thy state and crown
To Henry Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
Here cousin:
On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
Now is this golden crown like a deep well
That owes two buckets, filling one another,
The emptier ever dancing in the air,
The other down, unseen and full of water:
That bucket down and full of tears am I,
Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thought you had been willing to resign.

KING RICHARD II:
My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
You may my glories and my state depose,
But not my griefs; still am I king of those.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Part of your cares you give me with your crown.

KING RICHARD II:
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
My care is loss of care, by old care done;
Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
The cares I give I have, though given away;
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Are you contented to resign the crown?

KING RICHARD II:
Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
Now mark me, how I will undo myself;
I give this heavy weight from off my head
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
With mine own hands I give away my crown,
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
With mine own breath release all duty's rites:
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!
God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
And send him many years of sunshine days!
What more remains?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No more, but that you read
These accusations and these grievous crimes
Committed by your person and your followers
Against the state and profit of this land;
That, by confessing them, the souls of men
May deem that you are worthily deposed.

KING RICHARD II:
Must I do so? and must I ravel out
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,
If thy offences were upon record,
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
Containing the deposing of a king
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:
Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates
Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,
And water cannot wash away your sin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.

KING RICHARD II:
Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:
And yet salt water blinds them not so much
But they can see a sort of traitors here.
Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
I find myself a traitor with the rest;
For I have given here my soul's consent
To undeck the pompous body of a king;
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,
No, not that name was given me at the font,
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,
That I have worn so many winters out,
And know not now what name to call myself!
O that I were a mockery king of snow,
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,
To melt myself away in water-drops!
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
An if my word be sterling yet in England,
Let it command a mirror hither straight,
That it may show me what a face I have,
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.

KING RICHARD II:
Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The commons will not then be satisfied.

KING RICHARD II:
They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,
When I do see the very book indeed
Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.
Give me the glass, and therein will I read.
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
So many blows upon this face of mine,
And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,
Like to my followers in prosperity,
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
That every day under his household roof
Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face
That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
Was this the face that faced so many follies,
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
A brittle glory shineth in this face:
As brittle as the glory is the face;
For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,
How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
The shadow or your face.

KING RICHARD II:
Say that again.
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
And these external manners of laments
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
That swells with silence in the tortured soul;
There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,
For thy great bounty, that not only givest
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
And then be gone and trouble you no more.
Shall I obtain it?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Name it, fair cousin.

KING RICHARD II:
'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
For when I was a king, my flatterers
Were then but subjects; being now a subject,
I have a king here to my flatterer.
Being so great, I have no need to beg.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yet ask.

KING RICHARD II:
And shall I have?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You shall.

KING RICHARD II:
Then give me leave to go.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Whither?

KING RICHARD II:
Whither you will, so I were from your sights.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.

KING RICHARD II:
O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.

Abbot:
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
You holy clergymen, is there no plot
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?

Abbot:
My lord,
Before I freely speak my mind herein,
You shall not only take the sacrament
To bury mine intents, but also to effect
Whatever I shall happen to devise.
I see your brows are full of discontent,
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay
A plot shall show us all a merry day.

QUEEN:
This way the king will come; this is the way
To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
Have any resting for her true king's queen.
But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,
When triumph is become an alehouse guest?

KING RICHARD II:
Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
To think our former state a happy dream;
From which awaked, the truth of what we are
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
To grim Necessity, and he and I
Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France
And cloister thee in some religious house:
Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
Which our profane hours here have stricken down.

QUEEN:
What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed
Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
And fawn on rage with base humility,
Which art a lion and a king of beasts?

KING RICHARD II:
A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
I had been still a happy king of men.
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,
As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
Of woeful ages long ago betid;
And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
For why, the senseless brands will sympathize
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
And in compassion weep the fire out;
And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
For the deposing of a rightful king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;
With all swift speed you must away to France.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
The time shall not be many hours of age
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,
Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
It is too little, helping him to all;
And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way
To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,
Being ne'er so little urged, another way
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
The love of wicked men converts to fear;
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
To worthy danger and deserved death.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.

KING RICHARD II:
Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,
And then betwixt me and my married wife.
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,
She came adorned hither like sweet May,
Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.

QUEEN:
And must we be divided? must we part?

KING RICHARD II:
Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.

QUEEN:
Banish us both and send the king with me.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
That were some love but little policy.

QUEEN:
Then whither he goes, thither let me go.

KING RICHARD II:
So two, together weeping, make one woe.
Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.
Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.

QUEEN:
So longest way shall have the longest moans.

KING RICHARD II:
Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.

QUEEN:
Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
So, now I have mine own again, be gone,
That I might strive to kill it with a groan.

KING RICHARD II:
We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
When weeping made you break the story off,
of our two cousins coming into London.

DUKE OF YORK:
Where did I leave?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
At that sad stop, my lord,
Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.

DUKE OF YORK:
Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,
Bolingbroke!'
You would have thought the very windows spake,
So many greedy looks of young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Upon his visage, and that all the walls
With painted imagery had said at once
'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?

DUKE OF YORK:
As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
Are idly bent on him that enters next,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
His face still combating with tears and smiles,
The badges of his grief and patience,
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
And barbarism itself have pitied him.
But heaven hath a hand in these events,
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
Whose state and honour I for aye allow.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Here comes my son Aumerle.

DUKE OF YORK:
Aumerle that was;
But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
I am in parliament pledge for his truth
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
That strew the green lap of the new come spring?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
God knows I had as lief be none as one.

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For aught I know, my lord, they do.

DUKE OF YORK:
You will be there, I know.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
If God prevent not, I purpose so.

DUKE OF YORK:
What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My lord, 'tis nothing.

DUKE OF YORK:
No matter, then, who see it;
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
It is a matter of small consequence,
Which for some reasons I would not have seen.

DUKE OF YORK:
Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
I fear, I fear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What should you fear?
'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.

DUKE OF YORK:
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
Boy, let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.

DUKE OF YORK:
I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the matter, my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
Ho! who is within there?
Saddle my horse.
God for his mercy, what treachery is here!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, what is it, my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,
I will appeach the villain.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the matter?

DUKE OF YORK:
Peace, foolish woman.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Good mother, be content; it is no more
Than my poor life must answer.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thy life answer!

DUKE OF YORK:
Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots, I say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, York, what wilt thou do?
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
And rob me of a happy mother's name?
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou fond mad woman,
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
And interchangeably set down their hands,
To kill the king at Oxford.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
He shall be none;
We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?

DUKE OF YORK:
Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,
I would appeach him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hadst thou groan'd for him
As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
He is as like thee as a man may be,
Not like to me, or any of my kin,
And yet I love him.

DUKE OF YORK:
Make way, unruly woman!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
Spur post, and get before him to the king,
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:
And never will I rise up from the ground
Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
'Tis full three months since I did see him last;
If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
I would to God, my lords, he might be found:
Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,
For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,
With unrestrained loose companions,
Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,
And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
Takes on the point of honour to support
So dissolute a crew.

HENRY PERCY:
My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And what said the gallant?

HENRY PERCY:
His answer was, he would unto the stews,
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,
And wear it as a favour; and with that
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years
May happily bring forth. But who comes here?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the king?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What means our cousin, that he stares and looks
So wildly?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
To have some conference with your grace alone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
What is the matter with our cousin now?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Intended or committed was this fault?
If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,
To win thy after-love I pardon thee.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
That no man enter till my tale be done.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Have thy desire.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Villain, I'll make thee safe.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What is the matter, uncle? speak;
Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,
That we may arm us to encounter it.

DUKE OF YORK:
Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
The treason that my haste forbids me show.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
I do repent me; read not my name there
My heart is not confederate with my hand.

DUKE OF YORK:
It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;
Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
O loyal father of a treacherous son!
Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
From when this stream through muddy passages
Hath held his current and defiled himself!
Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
This deadly blot in thy digressing son.

DUKE OF YORK:
So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,
The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
Speak with me, pity me, open the door.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,
And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'
My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.

DUKE OF YORK:
If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.
This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;
This let alone will all the rest confound.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
Love loving not itself none other can.

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Rise up, good aunt.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Not yet, I thee beseech:
For ever will I walk upon my knees,
And never see day that the happy sees,
Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,
By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.

DUKE OF YORK:
Against them both my true joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;
His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:
He prays but faintly and would be denied;
We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have
That mercy which true prayer ought to have.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
I never long'd to hear a word till now;
Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.

DUKE OF YORK:
Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
That set'st the word itself against the word!
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
The chopping French we do not understand.
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I do not sue to stand;
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
But makes one pardon strong.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
With all my heart
I pardon him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A god on earth thou art.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,
With all the rest of that consorted crew,
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
Good uncle, help to order several powers
To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:
They shall not live within this world, I swear,
But I will have them, if I once know where.
Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.

EXTON:
Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
Was it not so?

Servant:
These were his very words.

EXTON:
'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
And urged it twice together, did he not?

Servant:
He did.

EXTON:
And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,
And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'
That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.

KING RICHARD II:
I have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world:
And for because the world is populous
And here is not a creature but myself,
I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
My soul the father; and these two beget
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
And these same thoughts people this little world,
In humours like the people of this world,
For no thought is contented. The better sort,
As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
With scruples and do set the word itself
Against the word:
As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
'It is as hard to come as for a camel
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
That many have and others must sit there;
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
Of such as have before endured the like.
Thus play I in one person many people,
And none contented: sometimes am I king;
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
And so I am: then crushing penury
Persuades me I was better when a king;
Then am I king'd again: and by and by
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,
Nor I nor any man that but man is
With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
With being nothing. Music do I hear?
Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,
When time is broke and no proportion kept!
So is it in the music of men's lives.
And here have I the daintiness of ear
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
But for the concord of my state and time
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
This music mads me; let it sound no more;
For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

Groom:
Hail, royal prince!

KING RICHARD II:
Thanks, noble peer;
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
What art thou? and how comest thou hither,
Where no man never comes but that sad dog
That brings me food to make misfortune live?

Groom:
I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,
With much ado at length have gotten leave
To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
In London streets, that coronation-day,
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!

KING RICHARD II:
Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
How went he under him?

Groom:
So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.

KING RICHARD II:
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
Since thou, created to be awed by man,
Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.

Keeper:
Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.

KING RICHARD II:
If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.

Groom:
What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.

Keeper:
My lord, will't please you to fall to?

KING RICHARD II:
Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.

Keeper:
My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
lately came from the king, commands the contrary.

KING RICHARD II:
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.

Keeper:
Help, help, help!

KING RICHARD II:
How now! what means death in this rude assault?
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.
Go thou, and fill another room in hell.
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand
Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.

EXTON:
As full of valour as of royal blood:
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
For now the devil, that told me I did well,
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
This dead king to the living king I'll bear
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
Is that the rebels have consumed with fire
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
Welcome, my lord what is the news?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
The next news is, I have to London sent
The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:
The manner of their taking may appear
At large discoursed in this paper here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;
Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.

HENRY PERCY:
The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy
Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
But here is Carlisle living, to abide
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Carlisle, this is your doom:
Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,
More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;
So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.

EXTON:
Great king, within this coffin I present
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my head and all this famous land.

EXTON:
From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
They love not poison that do poison need,
Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
But neither my good word nor princely favour:
With Cain go wander through shades of night,
And never show thy head by day nor light.
Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:
Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,
And put on sullen black incontinent:
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:
March sadly after; grace my mournings here;
In weeping after this untimely bier.


SAMPSON:
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

GREGORY:
No, for then we should be colliers.

SAMPSON:
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

GREGORY:
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.

SAMPSON:
I strike quickly, being moved.

GREGORY:
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON:
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

GREGORY:
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

SAMPSON:
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

GREGORY:
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
to the wall.

SAMPSON:
True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
to the wall.

GREGORY:
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

SAMPSON:
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
maids, and cut off their heads.

GREGORY:
The heads of the maids?

SAMPSON:
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.

GREGORY:
They must take it in sense that feel it.

SAMPSON:
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

GREGORY:
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
two of the house of the Montagues.

SAMPSON:
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.

GREGORY:
How! turn thy back and run?

SAMPSON:
Fear me not.

GREGORY:
No, marry; I fear thee!

SAMPSON:
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

GREGORY:
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
they list.

SAMPSON:
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:
I do bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
bite my thumb, sir.

GREGORY:
Do you quarrel, sir?

ABRAHAM:
Quarrel sir! no, sir.

SAMPSON:
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.

ABRAHAM:
No better.

SAMPSON:
Well, sir.

GREGORY:
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.

SAMPSON:
Yes, better, sir.

ABRAHAM:
You lie.

SAMPSON:
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

BENVOLIO:
Part, fools!
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

TYBALT:
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

BENVOLIO:
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.

TYBALT:
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward!

First Citizen:
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

CAPULET:
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULET:
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

CAPULET:
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

MONTAGUE:
Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE:
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

PRINCE:
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You Capulet; shall go along with me:
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

MONTAGUE:
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

BENVOLIO:
Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Till the prince came, who parted either part.

LADY MONTAGUE:
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

BENVOLIO:
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE:
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

BENVOLIO:
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

MONTAGUE:
I neither know it nor can learn of him.

BENVOLIO:
Have you importuned him by any means?

MONTAGUE:
Both by myself and many other friends:
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give cure as know.

BENVOLIO:
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

MONTAGUE:
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

BENVOLIO:
Good-morrow, cousin.

ROMEO:
Is the day so young?

BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine.

ROMEO:
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

BENVOLIO:
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO:
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

BENVOLIO:
In love?

ROMEO:
Out--

BENVOLIO:
Of love?

ROMEO:
Out of her favour, where I am in love.

BENVOLIO:
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

ROMEO:
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?

BENVOLIO:
No, coz, I rather weep.

ROMEO:
Good heart, at what?

BENVOLIO:
At thy good heart's oppression.

ROMEO:
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.

BENVOLIO:
Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

ROMEO:
Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

BENVOLIO:
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

ROMEO:
What, shall I groan and tell thee?

BENVOLIO:
Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.

ROMEO:
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO:
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

ROMEO:
A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.

BENVOLIO:
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

ROMEO:
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.

BENVOLIO:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

ROMEO:
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For beauty starved with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

ROMEO:
O, teach me how I should forget to think.

BENVOLIO:
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.

ROMEO:
'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

BENVOLIO:
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

CAPULET:
But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.

PARIS:
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET:
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

PARIS:
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

CAPULET:
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
Come, go with me.
Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

Servant:
Find them out whose names are written here! It is
written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
sent to find those persons whose names are here
writ, and can never find what names the writing
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.

ROMEO:
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

BENVOLIO:
For what, I pray thee?

ROMEO:
For your broken shin.

BENVOLIO:
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

ROMEO:
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.

Servant:
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

ROMEO:
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

Servant:
Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
pray, can you read any thing you see?

ROMEO:
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

Servant:
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

ROMEO:
Stay, fellow; I can read.
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
assembly: whither should they come?

Servant:
Up.

ROMEO:
Whither?

Servant:
To supper; to our house.

ROMEO:
Whose house?

Servant:
My master's.

ROMEO:
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

Servant:
Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest you merry!

BENVOLIO:
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO:
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

ROMEO:
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

LADY CAPULET:
Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

Nurse:
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

JULIET:
How now! who calls?

Nurse:
Your mother.

JULIET:
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

LADY CAPULET:
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

Nurse:
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

LADY CAPULET:
She's not fourteen.

Nurse:
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET:
A fortnight and odd days.

Nurse:
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man--took up the child:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

LADY CAPULET:
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

Nurse:
Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

JULIET:
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

Nurse:
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
An I might live to see thee married once,
I have my wish.

LADY CAPULET:
Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?

JULIET:
It is an honour that I dream not of.

Nurse:
An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers: by my count,
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

Nurse:
A man, young lady! lady, such a man
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

LADY CAPULET:
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

Nurse:
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

LADY CAPULET:
What say you? can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.

Nurse:
No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

LADY CAPULET:
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

JULIET:
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

Servant:
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

LADY CAPULET:
We follow thee.
Juliet, the county stays.

Nurse:
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

ROMEO:
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without a apology?

BENVOLIO:
The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they will;
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

ROMEO:
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

ROMEO:
Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

MERCUTIO:
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.

ROMEO:
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

MERCUTIO:
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

ROMEO:
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

MERCUTIO:
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in:
A visor for a visor! what care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

BENVOLIO:
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
But every man betake him to his legs.

ROMEO:
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

MERCUTIO:
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO:
Nay, that's not so.

MERCUTIO:
I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

ROMEO:
And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go.

MERCUTIO:
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO:
I dream'd a dream to-night.

MERCUTIO:
And so did I.

ROMEO:
Well, what was yours?

MERCUTIO:
That dreamers often lie.

ROMEO:
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

MERCUTIO:
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Then dreams, he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night,
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she--

ROMEO:
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing.

MERCUTIO:
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

BENVOLIO:
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

ROMEO:
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

BENVOLIO:
Strike, drum.

First Servant:
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

Second Servant:
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

First Servant:
Away with the joint-stools, remove the
court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony, and Potpan!

Second Servant:
Ay, boy, ready.

First Servant:
You are looked for and called for, asked for and
sought for, in the great chamber.

Second Servant:
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

CAPULET:
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?

Second Capulet:
By'r lady, thirty years.

CAPULET:
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

Second Capulet:
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
His son is thirty.

CAPULET:
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.

ROMEO:

Servant:
I know not, sir.

ROMEO:
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

TYBALT:
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

CAPULET:
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT:
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.

CAPULET:
Young Romeo is it?

TYBALT:
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET:
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

TYBALT:
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him.

CAPULET:
He shall be endured:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

TYBALT:
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

CAPULET:
Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

TYBALT:
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO:
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

JULIET:
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

ROMEO:
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIET:
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO:
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET:
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

ROMEO:
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.

JULIET:
You kiss by the book.

Nurse:
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

ROMEO:
What is her mother?

Nurse:
Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.

ROMEO:
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

BENVOLIO:
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

ROMEO:
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

CAPULET:
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
I'll to my rest.

JULIET:
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

Nurse:
The son and heir of old Tiberio.

JULIET:
What's he that now is going out of door?

Nurse:
Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

JULIET:
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

Nurse:
I know not.

JULIET:
Go ask his name: if he be married.
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

Nurse:
His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
The only son of your great enemy.

JULIET:
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.

Nurse:
What's this? what's this?

JULIET:
A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal.

Nurse:
Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

Chorus:
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

ROMEO:
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

MERCUTIO:
He is wise;
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.

BENVOLIO:
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

BENVOLIO:
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

MERCUTIO:
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
I conjure only but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO:
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO:
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?

BENVOLIO:
Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.

ROMEO:
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!

JULIET:
Ay me!

ROMEO:
She speaks:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.

JULIET:
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

ROMEO:
I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

JULIET:
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO:
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.

JULIET:
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

ROMEO:
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET:
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO:
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

JULIET:
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

ROMEO:
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.

JULIET:
I would not for the world they saw thee here.

ROMEO:
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

JULIET:
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

ROMEO:
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.

JULIET:
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

ROMEO:
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

JULIET:
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

ROMEO:
What shall I swear by?

JULIET:
Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.

ROMEO:
If my heart's dear love--

JULIET:
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

ROMEO:
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET:
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

ROMEO:
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

JULIET:
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.

ROMEO:
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

JULIET:
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.

ROMEO:
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

JULIET:
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

Nurse:

JULIET:
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--

Nurse:

JULIET:
By and by, I come:--
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will I send.

ROMEO:
So thrive my soul--

JULIET:
A thousand times good night!

ROMEO:
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

JULIET:
Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

ROMEO:
It is my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears!

JULIET:
Romeo!

ROMEO:
My dear?

JULIET:
At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?

ROMEO:
At the hour of nine.

JULIET:
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

ROMEO:
Let me stand here till thou remember it.

JULIET:
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.

ROMEO:
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.

JULIET:
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

ROMEO:
I would I were thy bird.

JULIET:
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

ROMEO:
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

ROMEO:
Good morrow, father.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

ROMEO:
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?

ROMEO:
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?

ROMEO:
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

ROMEO:
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combined, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when and where and how
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

ROMEO:
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

ROMEO:
And bad'st me bury love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Not in a grave,
To lay one in, another out to have.

ROMEO:
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

ROMEO:
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

MERCUTIO:
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?

BENVOLIO:
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

MERCUTIO:
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

MERCUTIO:
A challenge, on my life.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo will answer it.

MERCUTIO:
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

BENVOLIO:
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
dares, being dared.

MERCUTIO:
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO:
Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCUTIO:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
very first house, of the first and second cause:
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
hai!

BENVOLIO:
The what?

MERCUTIO:
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!

BENVOLIO:
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.

MERCUTIO:
Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.

ROMEO:
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

ROMEO:
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

MERCUTIO:
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.

ROMEO:
Meaning, to court'sy.

MERCUTIO:
Thou hast most kindly hit it.

ROMEO:
A most courteous exposition.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

ROMEO:
Pink for flower.

MERCUTIO:
Right.

ROMEO:
Why, then is my pump well flowered.

MERCUTIO:
Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.

ROMEO:
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
singleness.

MERCUTIO:
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

ROMEO:
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
was I with you there for the goose?

ROMEO:
Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose.

MERCUTIO:
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

ROMEO:
Nay, good goose, bite not.

MERCUTIO:
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.

ROMEO:
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO:
O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!

ROMEO:
I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

MERCUTIO:
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO:
Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO:
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

BENVOLIO:
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO:
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.

ROMEO:
Here's goodly gear!

MERCUTIO:
A sail, a sail!

BENVOLIO:
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

Nurse:
Peter!

PETER:
Anon!

Nurse:
My fan, Peter.

MERCUTIO:
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
fairer face.

Nurse:
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

MERCUTIO:
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.

Nurse:
Is it good den?

MERCUTIO:
'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the prick of noon.

Nurse:
Out upon you! what a man are you!

ROMEO:
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
mar.

Nurse:
By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
may find the young Romeo?

ROMEO:
I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

Nurse:
You say well.

MERCUTIO:
Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely.

Nurse:
if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
you.

BENVOLIO:
She will indite him to some supper.

MERCUTIO:
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

ROMEO:
What hast thou found?

MERCUTIO:
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
An old hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in lent
But a hare that is hoar
Is too much for a score,
When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
to dinner, thither.

ROMEO:
I will follow you.

MERCUTIO:
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
'lady, lady, lady.'

Nurse:
Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?

ROMEO:
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
to in a month.

Nurse:
An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?

PETER:
I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
good quarrel, and the law on my side.

Nurse:
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

ROMEO:
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
protest unto thee--

Nurse:
Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

ROMEO:
What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

Nurse:
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

ROMEO:
Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.

Nurse:
No truly sir; not a penny.

ROMEO:
Go to; I say you shall.

Nurse:
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

ROMEO:
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

Nurse:
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

ROMEO:
What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

Nurse:
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

ROMEO:
I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

NURSE:
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?

ROMEO:
Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.

Nurse:
Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
the--No; I know it begins with some other
letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
to hear it.

ROMEO:
Commend me to thy lady.

Nurse:
Ay, a thousand times.
Peter!

PETER:
Anon!

Nurse:
Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.

JULIET:
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she comes!
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

Nurse:
Peter, stay at the gate.

JULIET:
Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.

Nurse:
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

JULIET:
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

Nurse:
Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?

JULIET:
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

Nurse:
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?

JULIET:
No, no: but all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? what of that?

Nurse:
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

JULIET:
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

Nurse:
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

JULIET:
Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is your mother?'

Nurse:
O God's lady dear!
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.

JULIET:
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?

Nurse:
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

JULIET:
I have.

Nurse:
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way,
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

JULIET:
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!

ROMEO:
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
It is enough I may but call her mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air,
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

JULIET:
Good even to my ghostly confessor.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

JULIET:
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.

JULIET:
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one.

BENVOLIO:
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

MERCUTIO:
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

BENVOLIO:
Am I like such a fellow?

MERCUTIO:
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
soon moody to be moved.

BENVOLIO:
And what to?

MERCUTIO:
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

BENVOLIO:
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

MERCUTIO:
The fee-simple! O simple!

BENVOLIO:
By my head, here come the Capulets.

MERCUTIO:
By my heel, I care not.

TYBALT:
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.

MERCUTIO:
And but one word with one of us? couple it with
something; make it a word and a blow.

TYBALT:
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
will give me occasion.

MERCUTIO:
Could you not take some occasion without giving?

TYBALT:
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

MERCUTIO:
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!

BENVOLIO:
We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

MERCUTIO:
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

TYBALT:
Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.

MERCUTIO:
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'

TYBALT:
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
No better term than this,--thou art a villain.

ROMEO:
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

TYBALT:
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

ROMEO:
I do protest, I never injured thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

MERCUTIO:
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

TYBALT:
What wouldst thou have with me?

MERCUTIO:
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out.

TYBALT:
I am for you.

ROMEO:
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

MERCUTIO:
Come, sir, your passado.

ROMEO:
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

MERCUTIO:
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?

BENVOLIO:
What, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO:
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

ROMEO:
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

MERCUTIO:
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
was hurt under your arm.

ROMEO:
I thought all for the best.

MERCUTIO:
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too: your houses!

ROMEO:
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

BENVOLIO:
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

ROMEO:
This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but begins the woe, others must end.

BENVOLIO:
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

ROMEO:
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

TYBALT:
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.

ROMEO:
This shall determine that.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

ROMEO:
O, I am fortune's fool!

BENVOLIO:
Why dost thou stay?

First Citizen:
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

BENVOLIO:
There lies that Tybalt.

First Citizen:
Up, sir, go with me;
I charge thee in the princes name, obey.

PRINCE:
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

BENVOLIO:
O noble prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET:
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!

PRINCE:
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET:
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

PRINCE:
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

MONTAGUE:
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.

PRINCE:
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

JULIET:
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch?

Nurse:
Ay, ay, the cords.

JULIET:
Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

Nurse:
Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

JULIET:
Can heaven be so envious?

Nurse:
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

JULIET:
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I, if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

Nurse:
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

JULIET:
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

Nurse:
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead!

JULIET:
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?

Nurse:
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

JULIET:
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

Nurse:
It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

JULIET:
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!

Nurse:
There's no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!

JULIET:
Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

Nurse:
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

JULIET:
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lamentations might have moved?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

Nurse:
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

JULIET:
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
He made you for a highway to my bed;
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

Nurse:
Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

JULIET:
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And thou art wedded to calamity.

ROMEO:
Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company:
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

ROMEO:
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
Not body's death, but body's banishment.

ROMEO:
Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hence from Verona art thou banished:
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

ROMEO:
There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death: then banished,
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

ROMEO:
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But Romeo may not: more validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished:
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.

ROMEO:
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

ROMEO:
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

ROMEO:
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

ROMEO:
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.

ROMEO:
Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

Nurse:

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Welcome, then.

Nurse:
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

Nurse:
O, he is even in my mistress' case,
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
Why should you fall into so deep an O?

ROMEO:
Nurse!

Nurse:
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

ROMEO:
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
With blood removed but little from her own?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

Nurse:
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.

ROMEO:
As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold thy desperate hand:
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Romeo is coming.

Nurse:
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

ROMEO:
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

Nurse:
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

ROMEO:
How well my comfort is revived by this!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here:
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

ROMEO:
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

CAPULET:
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

PARIS:
These times of woe afford no time to woo.
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

LADY CAPULET:
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

CAPULET:
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
But, soft! what day is this?

PARIS:
Monday, my lord,

CAPULET:
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

PARIS:
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

CAPULET:
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me! it is so very very late,
That we may call it early by and by.
Good night.

JULIET:
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

ROMEO:
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

JULIET:
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

ROMEO:
Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
I have more care to stay than will to go:
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.

JULIET:
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

ROMEO:
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!

Nurse:
Madam!

JULIET:
Nurse?

Nurse:
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
The day is broke; be wary, look about.

JULIET:
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

ROMEO:
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.

JULIET:
Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!

ROMEO:
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

JULIET:
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

ROMEO:
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.

JULIET:
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

ROMEO:
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

JULIET:
O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
But send him back.

LADY CAPULET:

JULIET:
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

LADY CAPULET:
Why, how now, Juliet!

JULIET:
Madam, I am not well.

LADY CAPULET:
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

JULIET:
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

LADY CAPULET:
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.

JULIET:
Feeling so the loss,
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

JULIET:
What villain madam?

LADY CAPULET:
That same villain, Romeo.

JULIET:

LADY CAPULET:
That is, because the traitor murderer lives.

JULIET:
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

LADY CAPULET:
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

JULIET:
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!

LADY CAPULET:
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

JULIET:
And joy comes well in such a needy time:
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

LADY CAPULET:
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.

JULIET:
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

LADY CAPULET:
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

JULIET:
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

LADY CAPULET:
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
And see how he will take it at your hands.

CAPULET:
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother's son
It rains downright.
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
Without a sudden calm, will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave!

CAPULET:
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

JULIET:
Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.

CAPULET:
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!

LADY CAPULET:
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

JULIET:
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

CAPULET:
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
Or never after look me in the face:
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!

Nurse:
God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

CAPULET:
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

Nurse:
I speak no treason.

CAPULET:
O, God ye god-den.

Nurse:
May not one speak?

CAPULET:
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
For here we need it not.

LADY CAPULET:
You are too hot.

CAPULET:
God's bread! it makes me mad:
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match'd: and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
the streets,
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.

JULIET:
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse.

Nurse:
Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.

JULIET:
Speakest thou from thy heart?

Nurse:
And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both.

JULIET:
Amen!

Nurse:
What?

JULIET:
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
To make confession and to be absolved.

Nurse:
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

JULIET:
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else fail, myself have power to die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

PARIS:
My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
You say you do not know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the course, I like it not.

PARIS:
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears;
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society:
Now do you know the reason of this haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:

PARIS:
Happily met, my lady and my wife!

JULIET:
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

PARIS:
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

JULIET:
What must be shall be.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
That's a certain text.

PARIS:
Come you to make confession to this father?

JULIET:
To answer that, I should confess to you.

PARIS:
Do not deny to him that you love me.

JULIET:
I will confess to you that I love him.

PARIS:
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

JULIET:
If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

PARIS:
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.

JULIET:
The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.

PARIS:
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.

JULIET:
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

PARIS:
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

JULIET:
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

PARIS:
God shield I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

JULIET:
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this county.

JULIET:
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution.
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That copest with death himself to scape from it:
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

JULIET:
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
Each part, deprived of supple government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
Then, as the manner of our country is,
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
And hither shall he come: and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame;
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
Abate thy valour in the acting it.

JULIET:
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

JULIET:
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father!

CAPULET:
So many guests invite as here are writ.
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

Second Servant:
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
can lick their fingers.

CAPULET:
How canst thou try them so?

Second Servant:
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
fingers goes not with me.

CAPULET:
Go, be gone.
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

Nurse:
Ay, forsooth.

CAPULET:
Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

Nurse:
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

CAPULET:
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

JULIET:
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

CAPULET:
Send for the county; go tell him of this:
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

JULIET:
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.

CAPULET:
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
Our whole city is much bound to him.

JULIET:
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

LADY CAPULET:
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

CAPULET:
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

LADY  CAPULET:
We shall be short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.

CAPULET:
Tush, I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

JULIET:
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.

LADY CAPULET:
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

JULIET:
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
In this so sudden business.

LADY CAPULET:
Good night:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

JULIET:
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

LADY CAPULET:
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

Nurse:
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

CAPULET:
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
Spare not for the cost.

Nurse:
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
For this night's watching.

CAPULET:
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.

CAPULET:
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Now, fellow,
What's there?

First Servant:
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

CAPULET:
Make haste, make haste.
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

Second Servant:
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
And never trouble Peter for the matter.

CAPULET:
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
The county will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
Make haste, I say.

Nurse:
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest,
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

LADY CAPULET:
What noise is here?

Nurse:
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET:
What is the matter?

Nurse:
Look, look! O heavy day!

LADY CAPULET:
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Help, help! Call help.

CAPULET:
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

Nurse:
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!

LADY CAPULET:
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

CAPULET:
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Life and these lips have long been separated:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

Nurse:
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET:
O woful time!

CAPULET:
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

CAPULET:
Ready to go, but never to return.
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

PARIS:
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

LADY CAPULET:
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

Nurse:
O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woful day, O woful day!

PARIS:
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
O love! O life! not life, but love in death!

CAPULET:
Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
And all the better is it for the maid:
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
She's not well married that lives married long;
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
In all her best array bear her to church:
For though fond nature bids us an lament,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

CAPULET:
All things that we ordained festival,
Turn from their office to black funeral;
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

First Musician:
Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.

Nurse:
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.

First Musician:
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

PETER:
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

First Musician:
Why 'Heart's ease?'

PETER:
O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
to comfort me.

First Musician:
Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.

PETER:
You will not, then?

First Musician:
No.

PETER:
I will then give it you soundly.

First Musician:
What will you give us?

PETER:
No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
I will give you the minstrel.

First Musician:
Then I will give you the serving-creature.

PETER:
Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
I'll fa you; do you note me?

First Musician:
An you re us and fa us, you note us.

Second Musician:
Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

PETER:
Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
me like men:
'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
Then music with her silver sound'--
why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?

Musician:
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

PETER:
Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

Second Musician:
I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.

PETER:
Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?

Third Musician:
Faith, I know not what to say.

PETER:
O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
because musicians have no gold for sounding:
'Then music with her silver sound
With speedy help doth lend redress.'

First Musician:
What a pestilent knave is this same!

Second Musician:
Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
mourners, and stay dinner.

ROMEO:
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
to think!--
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
That I revived, and was an emperor.
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.

BALTHASAR:
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And presently took post to tell it you:
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

ROMEO:
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.

BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.

ROMEO:
Tush, thou art deceived:
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

BALTHASAR:
No, my good lord.

ROMEO:
No matter: get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary,--
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said
'An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
What, ho! apothecary!

Apothecary:
Who calls so loud?

ROMEO:
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

Apothecary:
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that utters them.

ROMEO:
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

Apothecary:
My poverty, but not my will, consents.

ROMEO:
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

Apothecary:
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

ROMEO:
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

FRIAR JOHN:
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

FRIAR JOHN:
Going to find a bare-foot brother out
One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

FRIAR JOHN:
I could not send it,--here it is again,--
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
Unto my cell.

FRIAR JOHN:
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Now must I to the monument alone;
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

PARIS:
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

PAGE:

PARIS:
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.

ROMEO:
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my lady's face;
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

BALTHASAR:
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

ROMEO:
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.

BALTHASAR:

ROMEO:
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!

PARIS:
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
It is supposed, the fair creature died;
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

ROMEO:
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head,
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

PARIS:
I do defy thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

ROMEO:
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

PAGE:
O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.

PARIS:
O, I am slain!
If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

ROMEO:
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O, how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

BALTHASAR:
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in the Capel's monument.

BALTHASAR:
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
One that you love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who is it?

BALTHASAR:
Romeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
How long hath he been there?

BALTHASAR:
Full half an hour.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go with me to the vault.

BALTHASAR:
I dare not, sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
And fearfully did menace me with death,
If I did stay to look on his intents.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR:
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo!
Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The lady stirs.

JULIET:
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
Come, go, good Juliet,
I dare no longer stay.

JULIET:
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make die with a restorative.
Thy lips are warm.

First Watchman:

JULIET:
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
This is thy sheath;
there rust, and let me die.

PAGE:
This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.

First Watchman:
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.

Second Watchman:
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

First Watchman:
Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.

Third Watchman:
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
We took this mattock and this spade from him,
As he was coming from this churchyard side.

First Watchman:
A great suspicion: stay the friar too.

PRINCE:
What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning's rest?

CAPULET:
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULET:
The people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With open outcry toward our monument.

PRINCE:
What fear is this which startles in our ears?

First Watchman:
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE:
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

First Watchman:
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
With instruments upon them, fit to open
These dead men's tombs.

CAPULET:
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,--
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

LADY CAPULET:
O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

PRINCE:
Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE:
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
What further woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE:
Look, and thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE:
O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
To press before thy father to a grave?

PRINCE:
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their
true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me of this direful murder;
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excused.

PRINCE:
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
And bear this work of heaven with patience:
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE:
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

BALTHASAR:
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
I departed not and left him there.

PRINCE:
Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

PAGE:
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by and by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.

PRINCE:
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

CAPULET:
O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE:
But I can give thee more:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET:
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

PRINCE:
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

WARWICK:
I wonder how the king escaped our hands.

YORK:
While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
He slily stole away and left his men:
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.

EDWARD:
Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
That this is true, father, behold his blood.

MONTAGUE:
And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.

RICHARD:
Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.

YORK:
Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?

NORFOLK:
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!

RICHARD:
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.

WARWICK:
And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
Before I see thee seated in that throne
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
This is the palace of the fearful king,
And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'

YORK:
Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
For hither we have broken in by force.

NORFOLK:
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.

YORK:
Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;
And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.

WARWICK:
And when the king comes, offer no violence,
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.

YORK:
The queen this day here holds her parliament,
But little thinks we shall be of her council:
By words or blows here let us win our right.

RICHARD:
Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.

WARWICK:
The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.

YORK:
Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
I mean to take possession of my right.

WARWICK:
Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.

KING HENRY VI:
My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
Even in the chair of state: belike he means,
Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.
And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!

CLIFFORD:
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.

WESTMORELAND:
What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.

KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.

CLIFFORD:
Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
My gracious lord, here in the parliament
Let us assail the family of York.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, know you not the city favours them,
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?

EXETER:
But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.

KING HENRY VI:
Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
I am thy sovereign.

YORK:
I am thine.

EXETER:
For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.

YORK:
'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.

EXETER:
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.

WARWICK:
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
In following this usurping Henry.

CLIFFORD:
Whom should he follow but his natural king?

WARWICK:
True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.

KING HENRY VI:
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?

YORK:
It must and shall be so: content thyself.

WARWICK:
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.

WESTMORELAND:
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.

WARWICK:
And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
That we are those which chased you from the field
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
March'd through the city to the palace gates.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.

WESTMORELAND:
Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.

CLIFFORD:
Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
As shall revenge his death before I stir.

WARWICK:
Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!

YORK:
Will you we show our title to the crown?
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.

KING HENRY VI:
What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
And seized upon their towns and provinces.

WARWICK:
Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.

KING HENRY VI:
The lord protector lost it, and not I:
When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.

RICHARD:
You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.

EDWARD:
Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.

MONTAGUE:
Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.

RICHARD:
Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.

YORK:
Sons, peace!

KING HENRY VI:
Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.

WARWICK:
Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
And be you silent and attentive too,
For he that interrupts him shall not live.

KING HENRY VI:
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
My title's good, and better far than his.

WARWICK:
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.

KING HENRY VI:
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.

YORK:
'Twas by rebellion against his king.

KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
What then?

KING HENRY VI:
An if he may, then am I lawful king;
For Richard, in the view of many lords,
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
Whose heir my father was, and I am his.

YORK:
He rose against him, being his sovereign,
And made him to resign his crown perforce.

WARWICK:
Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?

EXETER:
No; for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.

KING HENRY VI:
Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?

EXETER:
His is the right, and therefore pardon me.

YORK:
Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?

EXETER:
My conscience tells me he is lawful king.

KING HENRY VI:

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.

WARWICK:
Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
Can set the duke up in despite of me.

CLIFFORD:
King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!

KING HENRY VI:
O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!

YORK:
Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?

WARWICK:
Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
Or I will fill the house with armed men,
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
Write up his title with usurping blood.

KING HENRY VI:
My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:
Let me for this my life-time reign as king.

YORK:
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.

KING HENRY VI:
I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.

CLIFFORD:
What wrong is this unto the prince your son!

WARWICK:
What good is this to England and himself!

WESTMORELAND:
Base, fearful and despairing Henry!

CLIFFORD:
How hast thou injured both thyself and us!

WESTMORELAND:
I cannot stay to hear these articles.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nor I.

CLIFFORD:
Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.

WESTMORELAND:
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
And die in bands for this unmanly deed!

CLIFFORD:
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!

WARWICK:
Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.

EXETER:
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, Exeter!

WARWICK:
Why should you sigh, my lord?

KING HENRY VI:
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
But be it as it may: I here entail
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
And neither by treason nor hostility
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.

YORK:
This oath I willingly take and will perform.

WARWICK:
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.

KING HENRY VI:
And long live thou and these thy forward sons!

YORK:
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.

EXETER:
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!

YORK:
Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.

WARWICK:
And I'll keep London with my soldiers.

NORFOLK:
And I to Norfolk with my followers.

MONTAGUE:
And I unto the sea from whence I came.

KING HENRY VI:
And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.

EXETER:
Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:
I'll steal away.

KING HENRY VI:
Exeter, so will I.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.

KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Who can be patient in such extremes?
Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
And disinherited thine only son.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Father, you cannot disinherit me:
If you be king, why should not I succeed?

KING HENRY VI:
Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
And given unto the house of York such head
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
And creep into it far before thy time?
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
The duke is made protector of the realm;
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
Before I would have granted to that act.
But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
Whereby my son is disinherited.
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
And utter ruin of the house of York.
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.

KING HENRY VI:
Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.

KING HENRY VI:
Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.

PRINCE EDWARD:
When I return with victory from the field
I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.

KING HENRY VI:
Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.

EXETER:
And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
3 KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.

EDWARD:
No, I can better play the orator.

MONTAGUE:
But I have reasons strong and forcible.

YORK:
Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
What is your quarrel? how began it first?

EDWARD:
No quarrel, but a slight contention.

YORK:
About what?

RICHARD:
About that which concerns your grace and us;
The crown of England, father, which is yours.

YORK:
Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.

RICHARD:
Your right depends not on his life or death.

EDWARD:
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
It will outrun you, father, in the end.

YORK:
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.

EDWARD:
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.

RICHARD:
No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.

YORK:
I shall be, if I claim by open war.

RICHARD:
I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.

YORK:
Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.

RICHARD:
An oath is of no moment, being not took
Before a true and lawful magistrate,
That hath authority over him that swears:
Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.

YORK:
Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,
And tell him privily of our intent.
You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:
In them I trust; for they are soldiers,
Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,
But that I seek occasion how to rise,
And yet the king not privy to my drift,
Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?

Messenger:
The queen with all the northern earls and lords
Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
She is hard by with twenty thousand men;
And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.

YORK:
Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
My brother Montague shall post to London:
Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
Whom we have left protectors of the king,
With powerful policy strengthen themselves,
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.

MONTAGUE:
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,
You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;
The army of the queen mean to besiege us.

JOHN MORTIMER:
She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.

YORK:
What, with five thousand men?

RICHARD:
Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:
A woman's general; what should we fear?

EDWARD:
I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,
And issue forth and bid them battle straight.

YORK:
Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,
I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.
Many a battle have I won in France,
When as the enemy hath been ten to one:
Why should I not now have the like success?
3 KING HENRY VI

RUTLAND:
Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!

CLIFFORD:
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
As for the brat of this accursed duke,
Whose father slew my father, he shall die.

Tutor:
And I, my lord, will bear him company.

CLIFFORD:
Soldiers, away with him!

Tutor:
Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
Lest thou be hated both of God and man!

CLIFFORD:
How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.

RUTLAND:
So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
That trembles under his devouring paws;
And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
And not with such a cruel threatening look.
Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.

CLIFFORD:
In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.

RUTLAND:
Then let my father's blood open it again:
He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.

CLIFFORD:
Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine
Were not revenge sufficient for me;
No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
The sight of any of the house of York
Is as a fury to torment my soul;
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
Therefore--

RUTLAND:
O, let me pray before I take my death!
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!

CLIFFORD:
Such pity as my rapier's point affords.

RUTLAND:
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?

CLIFFORD:
Thy father hath.

RUTLAND:
But 'twas ere I was born.
Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,
Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
He be as miserably slain as I.
Ah, let me live in prison all my days;
And when I give occasion of offence,
Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.

CLIFFORD:
No cause!
Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.

RUTLAND:
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!

CLIFFORD:
Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,
Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.
3 KING HENRY VI

YORK:
The army of the queen hath got the field:
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
And all my followers to the eager foe
Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:
But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
Like men born to renown by life or death.
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
With bootless labour swim against the tide
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:
The sands are number'd that make up my life;
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
I am your butt, and I abide your shot.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
With downright payment, show'd unto my father.
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,
And made an evening at the noontide prick.

YORK:
My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
A bird that will revenge upon you all:
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?

CLIFFORD:
So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;
So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.

YORK:
O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;
And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,
And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!

CLIFFORD:
I will not bandy with thee word for word,
But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:
What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,
When he might spurn him with his foot away?
It is war's prize to take all vantages;
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
So doth the cony struggle in the net.

YORK:
So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What would your grace have done unto him now?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
What! was it you that would be England's king?
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
And made a preachment of your high descent?
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,
Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
And if thine eyes can water for his death,
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
I should lament thy miserable state.
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:
York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:
Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
And this is he was his adopted heir.
But how is it that great Plantagenet
Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
As I bethink me, you should not be king
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
And rob his temples of the diadem,
Now in his life, against your holy oath?
O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!
Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.

CLIFFORD:
That is my office, for my father's sake.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.

YORK:
She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
Unless the adage must be verified,
That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
The want thereof makes thee abominable:
Thou art as opposite to every good
As the Antipodes are unto us,
Or as the south to the septentrion.
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
Frenchwoman.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.

YORK:
That face of his the hungry cannibals
Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:
But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
And I with tears do wash the blood away.
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:
My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
I should not for my life but weep with him.
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.

CLIFFORD:
Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.

YORK:
Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
So York may overlook the town of York.
3 KING HENRY VI

EDWARD:
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
The happy tidings of his good escape.
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?

RICHARD:
I cannot joy, until I be resolved
Where our right valiant father is become.
I saw him in the battle range about;
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
So fared our father with his enemies;
So fled his enemies my warlike father:
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.
See how the morning opes her golden gates,
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
How well resembles it the prime of youth,
Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!

EDWARD:
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?

RICHARD:
Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
Not separated with the racking clouds,
But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
As if they vow'd some league inviolable:
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
In this the heaven figures some event.

EDWARD:
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
Each one already blazing by our meeds,
Should notwithstanding join our lights together
And over-shine the earth as this the world.
Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
Upon my target three fair-shining suns.

RICHARD:
Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
You love the breeder better than the male.
But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?

Messenger:
Ah, one that was a woful looker-on
When as the noble Duke of York was slain,
Your princely father and my loving lord!

EDWARD:
O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.

RICHARD:
Say how he died, for I will hear it all.

Messenger:
Environed he was with many foes,
And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
And many strokes, though with a little axe,
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
By many hands your father was subdued;
But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,
Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
They took his head, and on the gates of York
They set the same; and there it doth remain,
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.

EDWARD:
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
For never henceforth shall I joy again,
Never, O never shall I see more joy!

RICHARD:
I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me
Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
Or die renowned by attempting it.

EDWARD:
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
His dukedom and his chair with me is left.

RICHARD:
Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;
Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.

WARWICK:
How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?

RICHARD:
Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!

EDWARD:
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.

WARWICK:
Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
And now, to add more measure to your woes,
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
I, then in London keeper of the king,
Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
And very well appointed, as I thought,
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
Bearing the king in my behalf along;
For by my scouts I was advertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late decree in parliament
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
Or whether 'twas report of her success;
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
With promise of high pay and great rewards:
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
And we in them no hope to win the day;
So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
For in the marches here we heard you were,
Making another head to fight again.

EDWARD:
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
And when came George from Burgundy to England?

WARWICK:
Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
And for your brother, he was lately sent
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
With aid of soldiers to this needful war.

RICHARD:
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.

WARWICK:
Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
Were he as famous and as bold in war
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.

RICHARD:
I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
But in this troublous time what's to be done?
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.

WARWICK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
And of their feather many more proud birds,
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
He swore consent to your succession,
His oath enrolled in the parliament;
And now to London all the crew are gone,
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
May make against the house of Lancaster.
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
But never once again turn back and fly.

RICHARD:
Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.

EDWARD:
Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!

WARWICK:
No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
The next degree is England's royal throne;
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
In every borough as we pass along;
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
But sound the trumpets, and about our task.

RICHARD:
Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.

EDWARD:
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!

WARWICK:
How now! what news?

Messenger:
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,
The queen is coming with a puissant host;
And craves your company for speedy counsel.

WARWICK:
Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.
3 KING HENRY VI

QUEEN MARGARET:
Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.

CLIFFORD:
My gracious liege, this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
And long hereafter say unto his child,
'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away'?
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
And let his manly face, which promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.

KING HENRY VI:
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
Inferring arguments of mighty force.
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
That things ill-got had ever bad success?
And happy always was it for that son
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
And would my father had left me no more!
For all the rest is held at such a rate
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!

QUEEN MARGARET:
My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
You promised knighthood to our forward son:
Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.
Edward, kneel down.

KING HENRY VI:
Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.

PRINCE:
My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
And in that quarrel use it to the death.

CLIFFORD:
Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.

Messenger:
Royal commanders, be in readiness:
For with a band of thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;
And in the towns, as they do march along,
Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:
Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.

CLIFFORD:
I would your highness would depart the field:
The queen hath best success when you are absent.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be it with resolution then to fight.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My royal father, cheer these noble lords
And hearten those that fight in your defence:
Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'

EDWARD:
Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
And set thy diadem upon my head;
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?

EDWARD:
I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
I was adopted heir by his consent:
Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,
Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
To blot out me, and put his own son in.

CLIFFORD:
And reason too:
Who should succeed the father but the son?

RICHARD:
Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!

CLIFFORD:
Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
Or any he the proudest of thy sort.

RICHARD:
'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?

CLIFFORD:
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.

RICHARD:
For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.

WARWICK:
What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,
Your legs did better service than your hands.

WARWICK:
Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.

CLIFFORD:
You said so much before, and yet you fled.

WARWICK:
'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.

RICHARD:
Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
The execution of my big-swoln heart
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.

CLIFFORD:
I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?

RICHARD:
Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.

KING HENRY VI:
Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.

KING HENRY VI:
I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:
I am a king, and privileged to speak.

CLIFFORD:
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.

RICHARD:
Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
By him that made us all, I am resolved
that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.

EDWARD:
Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.

WARWICK:
If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
For York in justice puts his armour on.

PRINCE EDWARD:
If that be right which Warwick says is right,
There is no wrong, but every thing is right.

RICHARD:
Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.

QUEEN MARGARET:
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.

RICHARD:
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
Whose father bears the title of a king,--
As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?

EDWARD:
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
To make this shameless callet know herself.
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
By that false woman, as this king by thee.
His father revell'd in the heart of France,
And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd according to his state,
He might have kept that glory to this day;
But when he took a beggar to his bed,
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
And we, in pity of the gentle king,
Had slipp'd our claim until another age.

GEORGE:
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
And that thy summer bred us no increase,
We set the axe to thy usurping root;
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.

EDWARD:
And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
Not willing any longer conference,
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
And either victory, or else a grave.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Stay, Edward.

EDWARD:
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
I lay me down a little while to breathe;
For strokes received, and many blows repaid,
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.

EDWARD:
Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.

WARWICK:
How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?

GEORGE:
Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;
Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:
What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?

EDWARD:
Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.

RICHARD:
Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
And in the very pangs of death he cried,
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'
So, underneath the belly of their steeds,
That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.

WARWICK:
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.
Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;
And look upon, as if the tragedy
Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
Here on my knee I vow to God above,
I'll never pause again, never stand still,
Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
Or fortune given me measure of revenge.

EDWARD:
O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,
I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,
Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
That to my foes this body must be prey,
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!
Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.

RICHARD:
Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:
I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
That winter should cut off our spring-time so.

WARWICK:
Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.

GEORGE:
Yet let us all together to our troops,
And give them leave to fly that will not stay;
And call them pillars that will stand to us;
And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards
As victors wear at the Olympian games:
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;
For yet is hope of life and victory.
Forslow no longer, make we hence amain.
3 KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,
And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,
Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.

CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
To execute the like upon thyself;
And so, have at thee!

RICHARD:
Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING HENRY VI:
This battle fares like to the morning's war,
When dying clouds contend with growing light,
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
Forced to retire by fury of the wind:
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
Now one the better, then another best;
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
So is the equal of this fell war.
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
To whom God will, there be the victory!
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
They prosper best of all when I am thence.
Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
For what is in this world but grief and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
To be no better than a homely swain;
To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
How many make the hour full complete;
How many hours bring about the day;
How many days will finish up the year;
How many years a mortal man may live.
When this is known, then to divide the times:
So many hours must I tend my flock;
So many hours must I take my rest;
So many hours must I contemplate;
So many hours must I sport myself;
So many days my ewes have been with young;
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
Pass'd over to the end they were created,
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
His body couched in a curious bed,
When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

Son:
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
May be possessed with some store of crowns;
And I, that haply take them from him now,
May yet ere night yield both my life and them
To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.
O heavy times, begetting such events!
From London by the king was I press'd forth;
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;
And I, who at his hands received my life, him
Have by my hands of life bereaved him.
Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.

KING HENRY VI:
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;
And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.

Father:
Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,
Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:
For I have bought it with an hundred blows.
But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
O, pity, God, this miserable age!
What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,
Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!

KING HENRY VI:
Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
The red rose and the white are on his face,
The fatal colours of our striving houses:
The one his purple blood right well resembles;
The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:
Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;
If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.

Son:
How will my mother for a father's death
Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!

Father:
How will my wife for slaughter of my son
Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!

KING HENRY VI:
How will the country for these woful chances
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!

Son:
Was ever son so rued a father's death?

Father:
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?

KING HENRY VI:
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.

Son:
I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.

Father:
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,
For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;
And so obsequious will thy father be,
Even for the loss of thee, having no more,
As Priam was for all his valiant sons.
I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,
For I have murdered where I should not kill.

KING HENRY VI:
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
Here sits a king more woful than you are.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds
Having the fearful flying hare in sight,
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.

EXETER:
Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;
Or else come after: I'll away before.

KING HENRY VI:
Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:
Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!
3 KING HENRY VI

CLIFFORD:
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
More than my body's parting with my soul!
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
The common people swarm like summer flies;
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
Or as thy father and his father did,
Giving no ground unto the house of York,
They never then had sprung like summer flies;
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our death;
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.

EDWARD:
Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
That led calm Henry, though he were a king,
As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
Command an argosy to stem the waves.
But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?

WARWICK:
No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
For, though before his face I speak the words
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.

EDWARD:
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?

RICHARD:
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.

EDWARD:
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
If friend or foe, let him be gently used.

RICHARD:
Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
But set his murdering knife unto the root
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
I mean our princely father, Duke of York.

WARWICK:
From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;
Instead whereof let this supply the room:
Measure for measure must be answered.

EDWARD:
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.

WARWICK:
I think his understanding is bereft.
Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.

RICHARD:
O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
Which in the time of death he gave our father.

GEORGE:
If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.

RICHARD:
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.

EDWARD:
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.

WARWICK:
Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.

GEORGE:
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.

RICHARD:
Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.

EDWARD:
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.

GEORGE:
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?

WARWICK:
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.

RICHARD:
What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,
If this right hand would buy two hour's life,
That I in all despite might rail at him,
This hand should chop it off, and with the
issuing blood
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
York and young Rutland could not satisfy.

WARWICK:
Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,
And rear it in the place your father's stands.
And now to London with triumphant march,
There to be crowned England's royal king:
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
First will I see the coronation;
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,
To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.

EDWARD:
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
And never will I undertake the thing
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.

RICHARD:
Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.

WARWICK:
Tut, that's a foolish observation:
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,
To see these honours in possession.
3 KING HENRY VI

First Keeper:
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
For through this laund anon the deer will come;
And in this covert will we make our stand,
Culling the principal of all the deer.

Second Keeper:
I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.

First Keeper:
That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
In this self-place where now we mean to stand.

Second Keeper:
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.

KING HENRY VI:
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
No humble suitors press to speak for right,
No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
For how can I help them, and not myself?

First Keeper:
Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:
This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.

KING HENRY VI:
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
For wise men say it is the wisest course.

Second Keeper:
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.

First Keeper:
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.

KING HENRY VI:
My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
For Warwick is a subtle orator,
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
By this account then Margaret may win him;
For she's a woman to be pitied much:
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
And in conclusion wins the king from her,
With promise of his sister, and what else,
To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!

Second Keeper:
Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?

KING HENRY VI:
More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
A man at least, for less I should not be;
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?

Second Keeper:
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.

Second Keeper:
But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?

KING HENRY VI:
My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.

Second Keeper:
Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
Your crown content and you must be contented
To go along with us; for as we think,
You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his enemy.

KING HENRY VI:
But did you never swear, and break an oath?

Second Keeper:
No, never such an oath; nor will not now.

KING HENRY VI:
Where did you dwell when I was King of England?

Second Keeper:
Here in this country, where we now remain.

KING HENRY VI:
I was anointed king at nine months old;
My father and my grandfather were kings,
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?

First Keeper:
No;
For we were subjects but while you were king.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
And as the air blows it to me again,
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
And yielding to another when it blows,
Commanded always by the greater gust;
Such is the lightness of you common men.
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.

First Keeper:
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.

KING HENRY VI:
So would you be again to Henry,
If he were seated as King Edward is.

First Keeper:
We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
To go with us unto the officers.

KING HENRY VI:
In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
And what God will, that let your king perform;
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
Which we in justice cannot well deny,
Because in quarrel of the house of York
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

GLOUCESTER:
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were dishonour to deny it her.

KING EDWARD IV:
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Widow, we will consider of your suit;
And come some other time to know our mind.

LADY GREY:
Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
May it please your highness to resolve me now;
And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:

LADY GREY:
Three, my most gracious lord.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.

LADY GREY:
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.

KING EDWARD IV:
Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?

LADY GREY:
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.

KING EDWARD IV:
And would you not do much to do them good?

LADY GREY:
To do them good, I would sustain some harm.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.

LADY GREY:
Therefore I came unto your majesty.

KING EDWARD IV:
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.

LADY GREY:
So shall you bind me to your highness' service.

KING EDWARD IV:
What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?

LADY GREY:
What you command, that rests in me to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
But you will take exceptions to my boon.

LADY GREY:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.

LADY GREY:
Why, then I will do what your grace commands.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

LADY GREY:
Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?

KING EDWARD IV:
An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.

LADY GREY:
That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.

LADY GREY:
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.

LADY GREY:
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?

LADY GREY:
My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.

LADY GREY:
Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.

KING EDWARD IV:
But now you partly may perceive my mind.

LADY GREY:
My mind will never grant what I perceive
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.

KING EDWARD IV:
To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.

LADY GREY:
To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.

LADY GREY:
Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
For by that loss I will not purchase them.

KING EDWARD IV:
Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.

LADY GREY:
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.

LADY GREY:
Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:

LADY GREY:
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
I am a subject fit to jest withal,
But far unfit to be a sovereign.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
I speak no more than what my soul intends;
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.

LADY GREY:
And that is more than I will yield unto:
I know I am too mean to be your queen,
And yet too good to be your concubine.

KING EDWARD IV:
You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.

LADY GREY:
'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.

KING EDWARD IV:
No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
To be the father unto many sons.
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:
Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.

GLOUCESTER:
The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.

KING EDWARD IV:
You'll think it strange if I should marry her.

CLARENCE:
To whom, my lord?

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, Clarence, to myself.

GLOUCESTER:
That would be ten days' wonder at the least.

CLARENCE:
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.

GLOUCESTER:
By so much is the wonder in extremes.

KING EDWARD IV:
Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.

Nobleman:
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.

KING EDWARD IV:
See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
To question of his apprehension.
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
To cross me from the golden time I look for!
And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
The lustful Edward's title buried--
Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
Like one that stands upon a promontory,
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:
So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
Flattering me with impossibilities.
My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
What other pleasure can the world afford?
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
O miserable thought! and more unlikely
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
To make an envious mountain on my back,
Where sits deformity to mock my body;
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion me in every part,
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
That carries no impression like the dam.
And am I then a man to be beloved?
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such
As are of better person than myself,
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
And yet I know not how to get the crown,
For many lives stand between me and home:
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
Seeking a way and straying from the way;
Not knowing how to find the open air,
But toiling desperately to find it out,--
Torment myself to catch the English crown:
And from that torment I will free myself,
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
And frame my face to all occasions.
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING LEWIS XI:
Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
But now mischance hath trod my title down,
And with dishonour laid me on the ground;
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
And to my humble seat conform myself.

KING LEWIS XI:
Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?

QUEEN MARGARET:
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.

KING LEWIS XI:
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
And sit thee by our side:
Yield not thy neck
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
Is of a king become a banish'd man,
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
Usurps the regal title and the seat
Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:
Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
Our people and our peers are both misled,
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.

KING LEWIS XI:
Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
While we bethink a means to break it off.

QUEEN MARGARET:
The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.

KING LEWIS XI:
The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!

KING LEWIS XI:
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.

KING LEWIS XI:
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
For this is he that moves both wind and tide.

WARWICK:
From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
And then to crave a league of amity;
And lastly, to confirm that amity
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
To England's king in lawful marriage.

QUEEN MARGARET:

WARWICK:

QUEEN MARGARET:
King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
But from deceit bred by necessity;
For how can tyrants safely govern home,
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.

WARWICK:
Injurious Margaret!

PRINCE EDWARD:
And why not queen?

WARWICK:
Because thy father Henry did usurp;
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.

OXFORD:
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
Who by his prowess conquered all France:
From these our Henry lineally descends.

WARWICK:
Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
Of threescore and two years; a silly time
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.

OXFORD:
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?

WARWICK:
Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.

OXFORD:
Call him my king by whose injurious doom
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
When nature brought him to the door of death?
No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.

WARWICK:
And I the house of York.

KING LEWIS XI:
Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,
While I use further conference with Warwick.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!

KING LEWIS XI:
Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.

WARWICK:
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.

KING LEWIS XI:
But is he gracious in the people's eye?

WARWICK:
The more that Henry was unfortunate.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then further, all dissembling set aside,
Tell me for truth the measure of his love
Unto our sister Bona.

WARWICK:
Such it seems
As may beseem a monarch like himself.
Myself have often heard him say and swear
That this his love was an eternal plant,
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.

KING LEWIS XI:
Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.

BONA:
Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
Yet I confess that often ere this day,
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
Touching the jointure that your king must make,
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, but not to the English king.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
By this alliance to make void my suit:
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.

KING LEWIS XI:
And still is friend to him and Margaret:
But if your title to the crown be weak,
As may appear by Edward's good success,
Then 'tis but reason that I be released
From giving aid which late I promised.
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
That your estate requires and mine can yield.

WARWICK:
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
You have a father able to maintain you;
And better 'twere you troubled him than France.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.

Post:

OXFORD:
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
I hope all's for the best.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.

WARWICK:
Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.

KING LEWIS XI:
What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I told your majesty as much before:
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.

WARWICK:
King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
No more my king, for he dishonours me,
But most himself, if he could see his shame.
Did I forget that by the house of York
My father came untimely to his death?
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
Did I impale him with the regal crown?
Did I put Henry from his native right?
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
And to repair my honour lost for him,
I here renounce him and return to Henry.
My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
And replant Henry in his former state.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.

WARWICK:
So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
I'll undertake to land them on our coast
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
He's very likely now to fall from him,
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
Or than for strength and safety of our country.

BONA:
Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged
But by thy help to this distressed queen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?

BONA:
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.

WARWICK:
And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.

KING LEWIS XI:
And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
You shall have aid.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then, England's messenger, return in post,
And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his new bride:
Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.

BONA:
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
And I am ready to put armour on.

WARWICK:
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
There's thy reward: be gone.

KING LEWIS XI:
But, Warwick,
Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;
And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?

WARWICK:
This shall assure my constant loyalty,
That if our queen and this young prince agree,
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.

KING LEWIS XI:
Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
For mocking marriage with a dame of France.

WARWICK:
I came from Edward as ambassador,
But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
Had he none else to make a stale but me?
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
I was the chief that raised him to the crown,
And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
Not that I pity Henry's misery,
But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?

CLARENCE:
Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;
How could he stay till Warwick made return?

SOMERSET:
My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.

GLOUCESTER:
And his well-chosen bride.

CLARENCE:
I mind to tell him plainly what I think.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?

CLARENCE:
As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.

KING EDWARD IV:
Suppose they take offence without a cause,
They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,
Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.

GLOUCESTER:
And shall have your will, because our king:
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?

GLOUCESTER:
Not I:
No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd
Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity
To sunder them that yoke so well together.

KING EDWARD IV:
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
Should not become my wife and England's queen.
And you too, Somerset and Montague,
Speak freely what you think.

CLARENCE:
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
Becomes your enemy, for mocking him
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.

GLOUCESTER:
And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.

KING EDWARD IV:
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
By such invention as I can devise?

MONTAGUE:
Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance
Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.

HASTINGS:
Why, knows not Montague that of itself
England is safe, if true within itself?

MONTAGUE:
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.

HASTINGS:
'Tis better using France than trusting France:
Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
And with their helps only defend ourselves;
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.

CLARENCE:
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
And for this once my will shall stand for law.

GLOUCESTER:
And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
Unto the brother of your loving bride;
She better would have fitted me or Clarence:
But in your bride you bury brotherhood.

CLARENCE:
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.

KING EDWARD IV:
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.

CLARENCE:
In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,
Which being shallow, you give me leave
To play the broker in mine own behalf;
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
And not be tied unto his brother's will.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My lords, before it pleased his majesty
To raise my state to title of a queen,
Do me but right, and you must all confess
That I was not ignoble of descent;
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
But as this title honours me and mine,
So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.

KING EDWARD IV:
My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,
So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, messenger, what letters or what news
From France?

Post:
My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,
But such as I, without your special pardon,
Dare not relate.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?

Post:
At my depart, these were his very words:
'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his new bride.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?

Post:
These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'

KING EDWARD IV:
I blame not her, she could say little less;
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
For I have heard that she was there in place.

Post:
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
And I am ready to put armour on.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
But what said Warwick to these injuries?

Post:
He, more incensed against your majesty
Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?

Post:
Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in
friendship
That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.

CLARENCE:
Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;
That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
I may not prove inferior to yourself.
You that love me and Warwick, follow me.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;
And haste is needful in this desperate case.
Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
Go levy men, and make prepare for war;
They are already, or quickly will be landed:
Myself in person will straight follow you.
But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
If it be so, then both depart to him;
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
That I may never have you in suspect.

MONTAGUE:
So God help Montague as he proves true!

HASTINGS:
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
The common people by numbers swarm to us.
But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?

CLARENCE:
Fear not that, my lord.

WARWICK:
Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:
But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.
And now what rests but, in night's coverture,
Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
And but attended by a simple guard,
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
For I intend but only to surprise him.
You that will follow me to this attempt,
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:
For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!
3 KING HENRY VI

First Watchman:
Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:
The king by this is set him down to sleep.

Second Watchman:
What, will he not to bed?

First Watchman:
Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
Never to lie and take his natural rest
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.

Second Watchman:
To-morrow then belike shall be the day,
If Warwick be so near as men report.

Third Watchman:
But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
That with the king here resteth in his tent?

First Watchman:
'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.

Third Watchman:
O, is it so? But why commands the king
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
While he himself keeps in the cold field?

Second Watchman:
'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.

Third Watchman:
Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
I like it better than a dangerous honour.
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.

First Watchman:
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.

Second Watchman:
Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,
But to defend his person from night-foes?

WARWICK:
This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
Courage, my masters! honour now or never!
But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.

First Watchman:
Who goes there?

Second Watchman:
Stay, or thou diest!

SOMERSET:
What are they that fly there?

WARWICK:
Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.

KING EDWARD IV:
The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
Thou call'dst me king.

WARWICK:
Ay, but the case is alter'd:
When you disgraced me in my embassade,
Then I degraded you from being king,
And come now to create you Duke of York.
Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,
That know not how to use ambassadors,
Nor how to be contented with one wife,
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,
Nor how to study for the people's welfare,
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?
Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
Edward will always bear himself as king:
Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.

WARWICK:
Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:
But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,
I'll follow you, and tell what answer
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.

KING EDWARD IV:
What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
It boots not to resist both wind and tide.

OXFORD:
What now remains, my lords, for us to do
But march to London with our soldiers?

WARWICK:
Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
To free King Henry from imprisonment
And see him seated in the regal throne.
3 KING HENRY VI

RIVERS:
Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?

RIVERS:
What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, but the loss of his own royal person.

RIVERS:
Then is my sovereign slain?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
And, as I further have to understand,
Is new committed to the Bishop of York,
Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.

RIVERS:
These news I must confess are full of grief;
Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
And I the rather wean me from despair
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
This is it that makes me bridle passion
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown.

RIVERS:
But, madam, where is Warwick then become?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
To set the crown once more on Henry's head:
Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,
But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--
For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
To save at least the heir of Edward's right:
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
If Warwick take us we are sure to die.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,
Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
He hath good usage and great liberty,
And, often but attended with weak guard,
Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
I have advertised him by secret means
That if about this hour he make his way
Under the colour of his usual game,
He shall here find his friends with horse and men
To set him free from his captivity.

Huntsman:
This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, the time and case requireth haste:
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.

KING EDWARD IV:
But whither shall we then?

HASTINGS:
To Lynn, my lord,
And ship from thence to Flanders.

GLOUCESTER:
Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.

KING EDWARD IV:
Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.

GLOUCESTER:
But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.

KING EDWARD IV:
Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?

Huntsman:
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.

KING EDWARD IV:
Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;
And pray that I may repossess the crown.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING HENRY VI:
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
At our enlargement what are thy due fees?

Lieutenant:
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
But if an humble prayer may prevail,
I then crave pardon of your majesty.

KING HENRY VI:
For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
Conceive when after many moody thoughts
At last by notes of household harmony
They quite forget their loss of liberty.
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
He was the author, thou the instrument.
Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,
And that the people of this blessed land
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
I here resign my government to thee,
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.

WARWICK:
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,
For few men rightly temper with the stars:
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,
For choosing me when Clarence is in place.

CLARENCE:
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
To whom the heavens in thy nativity
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
As likely to be blest in peace and war;
And therefore I yield thee my free consent.

WARWICK:
And I choose Clarence only for protector.

KING HENRY VI:
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
That no dissension hinder government:
I make you both protectors of this land,
While I myself will lead a private life
And in devotion spend my latter days,
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.

WARWICK:
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?

CLARENCE:
That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
For on thy fortune I repose myself.

WARWICK:
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:
We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
To Henry's body, and supply his place;
I mean, in bearing weight of government,
While he enjoys the honour and his ease.
And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,
And all his lands and goods be confiscate.

CLARENCE:
What else? and that succession be determined.

WARWICK:
Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.

KING HENRY VI:
But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
Let me entreat, for I command no more,
That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
Be sent for, to return from France with speed;
For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.

CLARENCE:
It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.

KING HENRY VI:
My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
Of whom you seem to have so tender care?

SOMERSET:
My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.

KING HENRY VI:
Come hither, England's hope.
If secret powers
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself
Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.

WARWICK:
What news, my friend?

Post:
That Edward is escaped from your brother,
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.

WARWICK:
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?

Post:
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
In secret ambush on the forest side
And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;
For hunting was his daily exercise.

WARWICK:
My brother was too careless of his charge.
But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
A salve for any sore that may betide.

SOMERSET:
My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
And we shall have more wars before 't be long.
As Henry's late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts
What may befall him, to his harm and ours:
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
Till storms be past of civil enmity.

OXFORD:
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.

SOMERSET:
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
And says that once more I shall interchange
My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
And brought desired help from Burgundy:
What then remains, we being thus arrived
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,
But that we enter, as into our dukedom?

GLOUCESTER:
The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
For many men that stumble at the threshold
Are well foretold that danger lurks within.

KING EDWARD IV:
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
By fair or foul means we must enter in,
For hither will our friends repair to us.

HASTINGS:
My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.

Mayor:
My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.

KING EDWARD IV:
But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.

Mayor:
True, my good lord; I know you for no less.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
As being well content with that alone.

GLOUCESTER:

HASTINGS:
Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.

Mayor:
Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.

GLOUCESTER:
A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!

HASTINGS:
The good old man would fain that all were well,
So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.

KING EDWARD IV:
So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut
But in the night or in the time of war.
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
For Edward will defend the town and thee,
And all those friends that deign to follow me.

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.

KING EDWARD IV:
Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?

MONTAGUE:
To help King Edward in his time of storm,
As every loyal subject ought to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
Our title to the crown and only claim
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.

MONTAGUE:
Then fare you well, for I will hence again:
I came to serve a king and not a duke.
Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.

MONTAGUE:
What talk you of debating? in few words,
If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,
I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
To keep them back that come to succor you:
Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?

GLOUCESTER:
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?

KING EDWARD IV:
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.

HASTINGS:
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.

GLOUCESTER:
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
And Henry but usurps the diadem.

MONTAGUE:
Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
And now will I be Edward's champion.

HASTINGS:
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:
Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.

Soldier:
Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of
England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c.

MONTAGUE:
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
By this I challenge him to single fight.

All:
Long live Edward the Fourth!

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:
If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;
And when the morning sun shall raise his car
Above the border of this horizon,
We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,
And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
And with his troops doth march amain to London;
And many giddy people flock to him.

KING HENRY VI:
Let's levy men, and beat him back again.

CLARENCE:
A little fire is quickly trodden out;
Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.

WARWICK:
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,
Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:
Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,
Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find
Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:
And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
My sovereign, with the loving citizens,
Like to his island girt in with the ocean,
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
Shall rest in London till we come to him.
Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.
Farewell, my sovereign.

KING HENRY VI:
Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.

CLARENCE:
In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.

KING HENRY VI:
Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!

MONTAGUE:
Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.

OXFORD:
And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
And all at once, once more a happy farewell.

WARWICK:
Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.

KING HENRY VI:
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Should not be able to encounter mine.

EXETER:
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.

KING HENRY VI:
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,
My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
I have not been desirous of their wealth,
Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.
Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:
Then why should they love Edward more than me?
No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
The lamb will never cease to follow him.

EXETER:
Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?

KING EDWARD IV:
Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;
And once again proclaim us King of England.
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:
Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course
Where peremptory Warwick now remains:
The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
Away betimes, before his forces join,
And take the great-grown traitor unawares:
Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?

First Messenger:
By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.

WARWICK:
How far off is our brother Montague?
Where is the post that came from Montague?

Second Messenger:
By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.

WARWICK:
Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?

SOMERSET:
At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
And do expect him here some two hours hence.

WARWICK:
Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.

SOMERSET:
It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.

WARWICK:
Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.

SOMERSET:
They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.

GLOUCESTER:
See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!

WARWICK:
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,
That we could hear no news of his repair?

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.

WARWICK:
Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.

GLOUCESTER:
I thought, at least, he would have said the king;
Or did he make the jest against his will?

WARWICK:
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
I'll do thee service for so good a gift.

WARWICK:
'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.

WARWICK:
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
What is the body when the head is off?

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,
The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.

EDWARD:
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:
Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.

WARWICK:
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
And with the other fling it at thy face,
Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair
Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,
'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'

WARWICK:
O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!

OXFORD:
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
The gates are open, let us enter too.

KING EDWARD IV:
So other foes may set upon our backs.
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle:
If not, the city being but of small defence,
We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.

WARWICK:
O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.

MONTAGUE:
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.

KING EDWARD IV:
The harder match'd, the greater victory:
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.

SOMERSET:
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
Have sold their lives unto the house of York;
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.

WARWICK:
And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the nature of a brother's love!
Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.

CLARENCE:
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
I will not ruinate my father's house,
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his brother and his lawful king?
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
To keep that oath were more impiety
Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.
I am so sorry for my trespass made
That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.

WARWICK:
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!

KING EDWARD IV:
What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?

WARWICK:
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
I will away towards Barnet presently,
And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.

WARWICK:
Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
That I must yield my body to the earth
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
To search the secret treasons of the world:
The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;
For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.
Even now forsake me, and of all my lands
Is nothing left me but my body's length.
Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
And, live we how we can, yet die we must.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.
We might recover all our loss again;
The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:
Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!

WARWICK:
Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
That mought not be distinguished; but at last
I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
'O, farewell, Warwick!'

WARWICK:
Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.

OXFORD:
Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
That will encounter with our glorious sun,
Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.

CLARENCE:
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the source from whence it came:
The very beams will dry those vapours up,
For every cloud engenders not a storm.

GLOUCESTER:
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:
If she have time to breathe be well assured
Her faction will be full as strong as ours.

KING EDWARD IV:
We are advertised by our loving friends
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
We, having now the best at Barnet field,
Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;
And, as we march, our strength will be augmented
In every county as we go along.
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.
3 KING HENRY VI

QUEEN MARGARET:
Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
What though the mast be now blown overboard,
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength to that which hath too much,
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
Which industry and courage might have saved?
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
And Montague our topmost; what of him?
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
And Somerset another goodly mast?
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
All these the enemies to our poor bark.
Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,
Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.
This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
If case some one of you would fly from us,
That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,
Infuse his breast with magnanimity
And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
I speak not this as doubting any here
For did I but suspect a fearful man
He should have leave to go away betimes,
Lest in our need he might infect another
And make him of like spirit to himself.
If any such be here--as God forbid!--
Let him depart before we need his help.

OXFORD:
Women and children of so high a courage,
And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.
O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
To bear his image and renew his glories!

SOMERSET:
And he that will not fight for such a hope.
Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,
If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.

Messenger:
Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.

OXFORD:
I thought no less: it is his policy
To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.

SOMERSET:
But he's deceived; we are in readiness.

QUEEN MARGARET:
This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.

OXFORD:
Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.

KING EDWARD IV:
Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
I need not add more fuel to your fire,
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,
Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.
Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,
Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,
His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,
Be valiant and give signal to the fight.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:
For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.

OXFORD:
For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.

SOMERSET:
Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So part we sadly in this troublous world,
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
Shall have a high reward, and he his life?

GLOUCESTER:
It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!

KING EDWARD IV:
Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.
What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?

PRINCE EDWARD:
Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!
Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;
Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,
Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!

GLOUCESTER:
That you might still have worn the petticoat,
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;
His currish riddles sort not with this place.

GLOUCESTER:
By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.

GLOUCESTER:
For God's sake, take away this captive scold.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.

KING EDWARD IV:
Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.

CLARENCE:
Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I know my duty; you are all undutiful:
Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,
And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all
I am your better, traitors as ye are:
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.

KING EDWARD IV:
Take that, thou likeness of this railer here.

GLOUCESTER:
Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.

CLARENCE:
And there's for twitting me with perjury.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, kill me too!

GLOUCESTER:
Marry, and shall.

KING EDWARD IV:
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.

GLOUCESTER:
Why should she live, to fill the world with words?

KING EDWARD IV:
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.

GLOUCESTER:
Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;
I'll hence to London on a serious matter:
Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.

CLARENCE:
What? what?

GLOUCESTER:
The Tower, the Tower.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,
Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,
If this foul deed were by to equal it:
He was a man; this, in respect, a child:
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?
No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
You have no children, butchers! if you had,
The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:
But if you ever chance to have a child,
Look in his youth to have him so cut off
As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:
What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.

CLARENCE:
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,
Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?
Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;
Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.

KING EDWARD IV:
Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
Where's Richard gone?

CLARENCE:
To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
To make a bloody supper in the Tower.

KING EDWARD IV:
He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
With pay and thanks, and let's away to London
And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:
'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'

GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.

KING HENRY VI:
So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?

GLOUCESTER:
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
The thief doth fear each bush an officer.

KING HENRY VI:
The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
Have now the fatal object in my eye
Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
That taught his son the office of a fowl!
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.

KING HENRY VI:
I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
Than can my ears that tragic history.
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?

GLOUCESTER:
Think'st thou I am an executioner?

KING HENRY VI:
A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:
If murdering innocents be executing,
Why, then thou art an executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.

KING HENRY VI:
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
And orphans for their parents timeless death--
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
To signify thou camest to bite the world:
And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
Thou camest--

GLOUCESTER:
I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!

GLOUCESTER:
What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
O, may such purple tears be alway shed
From those that wish the downfall of our house!
If any spark of life be yet remaining,
Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:
I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;
For I have often heard my mother say
I came into the world with my legs forward:
Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'
And so I was; which plainly signified
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,
Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
I have no brother, I am like no brother;
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
Be resident in men like one another
And not in me: I am myself alone.
Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
For I will buz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
Counting myself but bad till I be best.
I'll throw thy body in another room
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
And two Northumberlands; two braver men
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
And made our footstool of security.
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.

CLARENCE:
The duty that I owe unto your majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.

GLOUCESTER:
And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now am I seated as my soul delights,
Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.

CLARENCE:
What will your grace have done with Margaret?
Reignier, her father, to the king of France
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
And hither have they sent it for her ransom.

KING EDWARD IV:
Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
And now what rests but that we spend the time
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
the like occasion whereon my services are now on
foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified in our loves; for indeed--

CAMILLO:
Beseech you,--

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
us.

CAMILLO:
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were trained together in their childhoods; and
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society, their encounters,
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
winds. The heavens continue their loves!

ARCHIDAMUS:
I think there is not in the world either malice or
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
into my note.

CAMILLO:
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
see him a man.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they else be content to die?

CAMILLO:
Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
desire to live.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If the king had no son, they would desire to live
on crutches till he had one.

POLIXENES:
Nine changes of the watery star hath been
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
Without a burthen: time as long again
Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
And yet we should, for perpetuity,
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
That go before it.

LEONTES:
Stay your thanks a while;
And pay them when you part.

POLIXENES:
Sir, that's to-morrow.
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
To tire your royalty.

LEONTES:
We are tougher, brother,
Than you can put us to't.

POLIXENES:
No longer stay.

LEONTES:
One seven-night longer.

POLIXENES:
Very sooth, to-morrow.

LEONTES:
We'll part the time between's then; and in that
I'll no gainsaying.

POLIXENES:
Press me not, beseech you, so.
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
Were there necessity in your request, although
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
Farewell, our brother.

LEONTES:
Tongue-tied, our queen?
speak you.

HERMIONE:
I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
He's beat from his best ward.

LEONTES:
Well said, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
But let him say so then, and let him go;
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
To let him there a month behind the gest
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?

POLIXENES:
No, madam.

HERMIONE:
Nay, but you will?

POLIXENES:
I may not, verily.

HERMIONE:
Verily!
You put me off with limber vows; but I,
Though you would seek to unsphere the
stars with oaths,
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
One of them you shall be.

POLIXENES:
Your guest, then, madam:
To be your prisoner should import offending;
Which is for me less easy to commit
Than you to punish.

HERMIONE:
Not your gaoler, then,
But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
You were pretty lordings then?

POLIXENES:
We were, fair queen,
Two lads that thought there was no more behind
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
And to be boy eternal.

HERMIONE:
Was not my lord
The verier wag o' the two?

POLIXENES:
We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
That any did. Had we pursued that life,
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
Hereditary ours.

HERMIONE:
By this we gather
You have tripp'd since.

POLIXENES:
O my most sacred lady!
Temptations have since then been born to's; for
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
Of my young play-fellow.

HERMIONE:
Grace to boot!
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
With any but with us.

LEONTES:
Is he won yet?

HERMIONE:
He'll stay my lord.

LEONTES:
At my request he would not.
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
To better purpose.

HERMIONE:
Never?

LEONTES:
Never, but once.

HERMIONE:
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
What was my first? it has an elder sister,
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
Nay, let me have't; I long.

LEONTES:
Why, that was when
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
'I am yours for ever.'

HERMIONE:
'Tis grace indeed.
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
The other for some while a friend.

LEONTES:

MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES:
I' fecks!
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
smutch'd thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
Art thou my calf?

MAMILLIUS:
Yes, if you will, my lord.

LEONTES:
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
To be full like me: yet they say we are
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
That will say anything but were they false
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
Thou dost make possible things not so held,
Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
With what's unreal thou coactive art,
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
And that beyond commission, and I find it,
And that to the infection of my brains
And hardening of my brows.

POLIXENES:
What means Sicilia?

HERMIONE:
He something seems unsettled.

POLIXENES:
How, my lord!
What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?

HERMIONE:
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
Are you moved, my lord?

LEONTES:
No, in good earnest.
How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
Will you take eggs for money?

MAMILLIUS:
No, my lord, I'll fight.

LEONTES:
You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Do seem to be of ours?

POLIXENES:
If at home, sir,
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
He makes a July's day short as December,
And with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts that would thick my blood.

LEONTES:
So stands this squire
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
Apparent to my heart.

HERMIONE:
If you would seek us,
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?

LEONTES:
To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
Be you beneath the sky.
I am angling now,
Though you perceive me not how I give line.
Go to, go to!
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
And arms her with the boldness of a wife
To her allowing husband!
Gone already!
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
ears a fork'd one!
Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
There have been,
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
And many a man there is, even at this present,
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
As mine, against their will. Should all despair
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
No barricado for a belly; know't;
It will let in and out the enemy
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!

MAMILLIUS:
I am like you, they say.

LEONTES:
Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?

CAMILLO:
Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES:
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

CAMILLO:
You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
When you cast out, it still came home.

LEONTES:
Didst note it?

CAMILLO:
He would not stay at your petitions: made
His business more material.

LEONTES:
Didst perceive it?
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
That he did stay?

CAMILLO:
At the good queen's entreaty.

LEONTES:
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
By any understanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
But of the finer natures? by some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance are to this business purblind? say.

CAMILLO:
Business, my lord! I think most understand
Bohemia stays here longer.

LEONTES:
Ha!

CAMILLO:
Stays here longer.

LEONTES:
Ay, but why?

CAMILLO:
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
Of our most gracious mistress.

LEONTES:
Satisfy!
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
In that which seems so.

CAMILLO:
Be it forbid, my lord!

LEONTES:
To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
From course required; or else thou must be counted
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And therein negligent; or else a fool
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
And takest it all for jest.

CAMILLO:
My gracious lord,
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
In every one of these no man is free,
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
Among the infinite doings of the world,
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
It was my folly; if industriously
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
Where of the execution did cry out
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
By its own visage: if I then deny it,
'Tis none of mine.

LEONTES:
Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Resides not in that man that does not think,--
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
Or else be impudently negative,
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.

CAMILLO:
I would not be a stander-by to hear
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
You never spoke what did become you less
Than this; which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that, though true.

LEONTES:
Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
If this be nothing.

CAMILLO:
Good my lord, be cured
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
For 'tis most dangerous.

LEONTES:
Say it be, 'tis true.

CAMILLO:
No, no, my lord.

LEONTES:
It is; you lie, you lie:
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
Or else a hovering temporizer, that
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
Infected as her life, she would not live
The running of one glass.

CAMILLO:
Who does infect her?

LEONTES:
Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
To see alike mine honour as their profits,
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
Which draught to me were cordial.

CAMILLO:
Sir, my lord,
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
But with a lingering dram that should not work
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly being honourable.
I have loved thee,--

LEONTES:
Make that thy question, and go rot!
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
Could man so blench?

CAMILLO:
I must believe you, sir:
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
Will take again your queen as yours at first,
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours.

LEONTES:
Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine own course have set down:
I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Go then; and with a countenance as clear
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
If from me he have wholesome beverage,
Account me not your servant.

LEONTES:
This is all:
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
Do't not, thou split'st thine own.

CAMILLO:
I'll do't, my lord.

LEONTES:
I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.

CAMILLO:
O miserable lady! But, for me,
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Is the obedience to a master, one
Who in rebellion with himself will have
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
Promotion follows. If I could find example
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
Let villany itself forswear't. I must
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
Here comes Bohemia.

POLIXENES:
This is strange: methinks
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
Good day, Camillo.

CAMILLO:
Hail, most royal sir!

POLIXENES:
What is the news i' the court?

CAMILLO:
None rare, my lord.

POLIXENES:
The king hath on him such a countenance
As he had lost some province and a region
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
With customary compliment; when he,
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
So leaves me to consider what is breeding
That changeth thus his manners.

CAMILLO:
I dare not know, my lord.

POLIXENES:
How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
A party in this alteration, finding
Myself thus alter'd with 't.

CAMILLO:
There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
Of you that yet are well.

POLIXENES:
How! caught of me!
Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
In ignorant concealment.

CAMILLO:
I may not answer.

POLIXENES:
A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
What incidency thou dost guess of harm
Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
Which way to be prevented, if to be;
If not, how best to bear it.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I will tell you;
Since I am charged in honour and by him
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
Cry lost, and so good night!

POLIXENES:
On, good Camillo.

CAMILLO:
I am appointed him to murder you.

POLIXENES:
By whom, Camillo?

CAMILLO:
By the king.

POLIXENES:
For what?

CAMILLO:
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
As he had seen't or been an instrument
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
Forbiddenly.

POLIXENES:
O, then my best blood turn
To an infected jelly and my name
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
Turn then my freshest reputation to
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
That e'er was heard or read!

CAMILLO:
Swear his thought over
By each particular star in heaven and
By all their influences, you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
The standing of his body.

POLIXENES:
How should this grow?

CAMILLO:
I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
Your followers I will whisper to the business,
And will by twos and threes at several posterns
Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
My fortunes to your service, which are here
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
For, by the honour of my parents, I
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
His execution sworn.

POLIXENES:
I do believe thee:
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
My people did expect my hence departure
Two days ago. This jealousy
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
I will respect thee as a father if
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

CAMILLO:
It is in mine authority to command
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

HERMIONE:
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
'Tis past enduring.

First Lady:
Come, my gracious lord,
Shall I be your playfellow?

MAMILLIUS:
No, I'll none of you.

First Lady:
Why, my sweet lord?

MAMILLIUS:
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you better.

Second Lady:
And why so, my lord?

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
Become some women best, so that there be not
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
Or a half-moon made with a pen.

Second Lady:
Who taught you this?

MAMILLIUS:
I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
What colour are your eyebrows?

First Lady:
Blue, my lord.

MAMILLIUS:
Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

First Lady:
Hark ye;
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
Present our services to a fine new prince
One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
If we would have you.

Second Lady:
She is spread of late
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!

HERMIONE:
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
And tell 's a tale.

MAMILLIUS:
Merry or sad shall't be?

HERMIONE:
As merry as you will.

MAMILLIUS:
A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
Of sprites and goblins.

HERMIONE:
Let's have that, good sir.
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

MAMILLIUS:
There was a man--

HERMIONE:
Nay, come, sit down; then on.

MAMILLIUS:
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
Yond crickets shall not hear it.

HERMIONE:
Come on, then,
And give't me in mine ear.

LEONTES:
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?

First Lord:
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
Even to their ships.

LEONTES:
How blest am I
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
Is not infected: but if one present
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
With violent hefts. I have drunk,
and seen the spider.
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
There is a plot against my life, my crown;
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
He has discover'd my design, and I
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
For them to play at will. How came the posterns
So easily open?

First Lord:
By his great authority;
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
On your command.

LEONTES:
I know't too well.
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Have too much blood in him.

HERMIONE:
What is this? sport?

LEONTES:
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
Away with him! and let her sport herself
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
Has made thee swell thus.

HERMIONE:
But I'ld say he had not,
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.

LEONTES:
You, my lords,
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
The justice of your bearts will thereto add
'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
Praise her but for this her without-door form,
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
That mercy does, for calumny will sear
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
She's an adulteress.

HERMIONE:
Should a villain say so,
The most replenish'd villain in the world,
He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
Do but mistake.

LEONTES:
You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
Should a like language use to all degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
A federary with her, and one that knows
What she should shame to know herself
But with her most vile principal, that she's
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
To this their late escape.

HERMIONE:
No, by my life.
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You did mistake.

LEONTES:
No; if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon,
The centre is not big enough to bear
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he speaks.

HERMIONE:
There's some ill planet reigns:
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
The king's will be perform'd!

LEONTES:
Shall I be heard?

HERMIONE:
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
My women may be with me; for you see
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this action I now go on
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.

LEONTES:
Go, do our bidding; hence!

First Lord:
Beseech your highness, call the queen again.

ANTIGONUS:
Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen, your son.

First Lord:
For her, my lord,
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
In this which you accuse her.

ANTIGONUS:
If it prove
She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
For every inch of woman in the world,
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.

LEONTES:
Hold your peaces.

First Lord:
Good my lord,--

ANTIGONUS:
It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
You are abused and by some putter-on
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
The second and the third, nine, and some five;
If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
by mine honour,
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue.

LEONTES:
Cease; no more.
You smell this business with a sense as cold
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
As you feel doing thus; and see withal
The instruments that feel.

ANTIGONUS:
If it be so,
We need no grave to bury honesty:
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth.

LEONTES:
What! lack I credit?

First Lord:
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would content me
To have her honour true than your suspicion,
Be blamed for't how you might.

LEONTES:
Why, what need we
Commune with you of this, but rather follow
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
We need no more of your advice: the matter,
The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
Properly ours.

ANTIGONUS:
And I wish, my liege,
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
Without more overture.

LEONTES:
How could that be?
Either thou art most ignorant by age,
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
Added to their familiarity,
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
But only seeing, all other circumstances
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
Yet, for a greater confirmation,
For in an act of this importance 'twere
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

First Lord:
Well done, my lord.

LEONTES:
Though I am satisfied and need no more
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
From our free person she should be confined,
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
We are to speak in public; for this business
Will raise us all.

ANTIGONUS:

PAULINA:
The keeper of the prison, call to him;
let him have knowledge who I am.
Good lady,
No court in Europe is too good for thee;
What dost thou then in prison?
Now, good sir,
You know me, do you not?

Gaoler:
For a worthy lady
And one whom much I honour.

PAULINA:
Pray you then,
Conduct me to the queen.

Gaoler:
I may not, madam:
To the contrary I have express commandment.

PAULINA:
Here's ado,
To lock up honesty and honour from
The access of gentle visitors!
Is't lawful, pray you,
To see her women? any of them? Emilia?

Gaoler:
So please you, madam,
To put apart these your attendants, I
Shall bring Emilia forth.

PAULINA:
I pray now, call her.
Withdraw yourselves.

Gaoler:
And, madam,
I must be present at your conference.

PAULINA:
Well, be't so, prithee.
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
As passes colouring.
Dear gentlewoman,
How fares our gracious lady?

EMILIA:
As well as one so great and so forlorn
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
Which never tender lady hath born greater,
She is something before her time deliver'd.

PAULINA:
A boy?

EMILIA:
A daughter, and a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
I am innocent as you.'

PAULINA:
I dare be sworn
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
beshrew them!
He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
And never to my red-look'd anger be
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
Commend my best obedience to the queen:
If she dares trust me with her little babe,
I'll show't the king and undertake to be
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
The silence often of pure innocence
Persuades when speaking fails.

EMILIA:
Most worthy madam,
Your honour and your goodness is so evident
That your free undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue: there is no lady living
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
To visit the next room, I'll presently
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
Lest she should be denied.

PAULINA:
Tell her, Emilia.
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
I shall do good.

EMILIA:
Now be you blest for it!
I'll to the queen: please you,
come something nearer.

Gaoler:
Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
Having no warrant.

PAULINA:
You need not fear it, sir:
This child was prisoner to the womb and is
By law and process of great nature thence
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
The anger of the king nor guilty of,
If any be, the trespass of the queen.

Gaoler:
I do believe it.

PAULINA:
Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
I will stand betwixt you and danger.

LEONTES:
Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
She the adulteress; for the harlot king
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
Might come to me again. Who's there?

First Servant:
My lord?

LEONTES:
How does the boy?

First Servant:
He took good rest to-night;
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.

LEONTES:
To see his nobleness!
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
See how he fares.
Fie, fie! no thought of him:
The thought of my revenges that way
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
Shall she within my power.

First Lord:
You must not enter.

PAULINA:
Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
More free than he is jealous.

ANTIGONUS:
That's enough.

Second Servant:
Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
None should come at him.

PAULINA:
Not so hot, good sir:
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
At each his needless heavings, such as you
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
Do come with words as medicinal as true,
Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
That presses him from sleep.

LEONTES:
What noise there, ho?

PAULINA:
No noise, my lord; but needful conference
About some gossips for your highness.

LEONTES:
How!
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
I charged thee that she should not come about me:
I knew she would.

ANTIGONUS:
I told her so, my lord,
On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
She should not visit you.

LEONTES:
What, canst not rule her?

PAULINA:
From all dishonesty he can: in this,
Unless he take the course that you have done,
Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
He shall not rule me.

ANTIGONUS:
La you now, you hear:
When she will take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not stumble.

PAULINA:
Good my liege, I come;
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
Less appear so in comforting your evils,
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
From your good queen.

LEONTES:
Good queen!

PAULINA:
Good queen, my lord,
Good queen; I say good queen;
And would by combat make her good, so were I
A man, the worst about you.

LEONTES:
Force her hence.

PAULINA:
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.

LEONTES:
Out!
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
A most intelligencing bawd!

PAULINA:
Not so:
I am as ignorant in that as you
In so entitling me, and no less honest
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
As this world goes, to pass for honest.

LEONTES:
Traitors!
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.

PAULINA:
For ever
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
Which he has put upon't!

LEONTES:
He dreads his wife.

PAULINA:
So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
You'ld call your children yours.

LEONTES:
A nest of traitors!

ANTIGONUS:
I am none, by this good light.

PAULINA:
Nor I, nor any
But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;
and will not--
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
The root of his opinion, which is rotten
As ever oak or stone was sound.

LEONTES:
A callat
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
It is the issue of Polixenes:
Hence with it, and together with the dam
Commit them to the fire!

PAULINA:
It is yours;
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
Although the print be little, the whole matter
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
His smiles,
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
So like to him that got it, if thou hast
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
Her children not her husband's!

LEONTES:
A gross hag
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
That wilt not stay her tongue.

ANTIGONUS:
Hang all the husbands
That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
Hardly one subject.

LEONTES:
Once more, take her hence.

PAULINA:
A most unworthy and unnatural lord
Can do no more.

LEONTES:
I'll ha' thee burnt.

PAULINA:
I care not:
It is an heretic that makes the fire,
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
But this most cruel usage of your queen,
Not able to produce more accusation
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
Yea, scandalous to the world.

LEONTES:
On your allegiance,
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
If she did know me one. Away with her!

PAULINA:
I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:
Jove send her
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
Will never do him good, not one of you.
So, so: farewell; we are gone.

LEONTES:
Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
And see it instantly consumed with fire;
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
The bastard brains with these my proper hands
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
For thou set'st on thy wife.

ANTIGONUS:
I did not, sir:
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
Can clear me in't.

Lords:
We can: my royal liege,
He is not guilty of her coming hither.

LEONTES:
You're liars all.

First Lord:
Beseech your highness, give us better credit:
We have always truly served you, and beseech you
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
As recompense of our dear services
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

LEONTES:
I am a feather for each wind that blows:
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
And call me father? better burn it now
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
You that have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
So sure as this beard's grey,
--what will you adventure
To save this brat's life?

ANTIGONUS:
Any thing, my lord,
That my ability may undergo
And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
To save the innocent: any thing possible.

LEONTES:
It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
Thou wilt perform my bidding.

ANTIGONUS:
I will, my lord.

LEONTES:
Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
Of any point in't shall not only be
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
Without more mercy, to its own protection
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
That thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

ANTIGONUS:
I swear to do this, though a present death
Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
Casting their savageness aside have done
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
In more than this deed does require! And blessing
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!

LEONTES:
No, I'll not rear
Another's issue.

Servant:
Please your highness, posts
From those you sent to the oracle are come
An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,
Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
Hasting to the court.

First Lord:
So please you, sir, their speed
Hath been beyond account.

LEONTES:
Twenty-three days
They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
The great Apollo suddenly will have
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
Summon a session, that we may arraign
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
Been publicly accused, so shall she have
A just and open trial. While she lives
My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
And think upon my bidding.

CLEOMENES:
The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
The common praise it bears.

DION:
I shall report,
For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
It was i' the offering!

CLEOMENES:
But of all, the burst
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
That I was nothing.

DION:
If the event o' the journey
Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
The time is worth the use on't.

CLEOMENES:
Great Apollo
Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
I little like.

DION:
The violent carriage of it
Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
Shall the contents discover, something rare
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
And gracious be the issue!

LEONTES:
This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
Even to the guilt or the purgation.
Produce the prisoner.

Officer:
It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
Appear in person here in court. Silence!

LEONTES:
Read the indictment.

Officer:

HERMIONE:
Since what I am to say must be but that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The testimony on my part no other
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Behold our human actions, as they do,
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
False accusation blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
Who least will seem to do so, my past life
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
As I am now unhappy; which is more
Than history can pattern, though devised
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
And only that I stand for. I appeal
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,
With what encounter so uncurrent I
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
The bound of honour, or in act or will
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
Cry fie upon my grave!

LEONTES:
I ne'er heard yet
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Than to perform it first.

HERMIONE:
That's true enough;
Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

LEONTES:
You will not own it.

HERMIONE:
More than mistress of
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
With whom I am accused, I do confess
I loved him as in honour he required,
With such a kind of love as might become
A lady like me, with a love even such,
So and no other, as yourself commanded:
Which not to have done I think had been in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
For me to try how: all I know of it
Is that Camillo was an honest man;
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

LEONTES:
You knew of his departure, as you know
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.

HERMIONE:
Sir,
You speak a language that I understand not:
My life stands in the level of your dreams,
Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES:
Your actions are my dreams;
You had a bastard by Polixenes,
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
Look for no less than death.

HERMIONE:
Sir, spare your threats:
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity:
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
But know not how it went. My second joy
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
Haled out to murder: myself on every post
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this place, i' the open air, before
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
I do refer me to the oracle:
Apollo be my judge!

First Lord:
This your request
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
And in Apollos name, his oracle.

HERMIONE:
The Emperor of Russia was my father:
O that he were alive, and here beholding
His daughter's trial! that he did but see
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
Of pity, not revenge!

Officer:
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
You have not dared to break the holy seal
Nor read the secrets in't.

CLEOMENES:
All this we swear.

LEONTES:
Break up the seals and read.

Officer:

Lords:
Now blessed be the great Apollo!

HERMIONE:
Praised!

LEONTES:
Hast thou read truth?

Officer:
Ay, my lord; even so
As it is here set down.

LEONTES:
There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.

Servant:
My lord the king, the king!

LEONTES:
What is the business?

Servant:
O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
Of the queen's speed, is gone.

LEONTES:
How! gone!

Servant:
Is dead.

LEONTES:
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
Do strike at my injustice.
How now there!

PAULINA:
This news is mortal to the queen: look down
And see what death is doing.

LEONTES:
Take her hence:
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life.
Apollo, pardon
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
For, being transported by my jealousies
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
Camillo for the minister to poison
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command, though I with death and with
Reward did threaten and encourage him,
Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
Which you knew great, and to the hazard
Of all encertainties himself commended,
No richer than his honour: how he glisters
Thorough my rust! and how his pity
Does my deeds make the blacker!

PAULINA:
Woe the while!
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
Break too.

First Lord:
What fit is this, good lady?

PAULINA:
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Must I receive, whose every word deserves
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
Together working with thy jealousies,
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
To be or none or little; though a devil
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
and vengeance for't
Not dropp'd down yet.

First Lord:
The higher powers forbid!

PAULINA:
I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
Upon a barren mountain and still winter
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
To look that way thou wert.

LEONTES:
Go on, go on
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
All tongues to talk their bitterest.

First Lord:
Say no more:
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
I' the boldness of your speech.

PAULINA:
I am sorry for't:
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
At my petition; I beseech you, rather
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
I'll not remember you of my own lord,
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
And I'll say nothing.

LEONTES:
Thou didst speak but well
When most the truth; which I receive much better
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
The causes of their death appear, unto
Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
Will bear up with this exercise, so long
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
Unto these sorrows.

ANTIGONUS:
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Bohemia?

Mariner:
Ay, my lord: and fear
We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
And frown upon 's.

ANTIGONUS:
Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
I call upon thee.

Mariner:
Make your best haste, and go not
Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
Of prey that keep upon't.

ANTIGONUS:
Go thou away:
I'll follow instantly.

Mariner:
I am glad at heart
To be so rid o' the business.

ANTIGONUS:
Come, poor babe:
I have heard, but not believed,
the spirits o' the dead
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
She melted into air. Affrighted much,
I did in time collect myself and thought
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
I will be squared by this. I do believe
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
There lie, and there thy character: there these;
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
I am gone for ever.

Shepherd:
I would there were no age between sixteen and
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
rest; for there is nothing in the between but
getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,
stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find
than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by
the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
though I am not bookish, yet I can read
waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!

Clown:
Hilloa, loa!

Shepherd:
What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk
on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What
ailest thou, man?

Clown:
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
a bodkin's point.

Shepherd:
Why, boy, how is it?

Clown:
I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
cork into a hogshead. And then for the
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
the sea or weather.

Shepherd:
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

Clown:
Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor
the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
now.

Shepherd:
Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!

Clown:
I would you had been by the ship side, to have
helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.

Shepherd:
Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for
thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;
open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be
rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
open't. What's within, boy?

Clown:
You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!

Shepherd:
This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
boy, the next way home.

Clown:
Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
it.

Shepherd:
That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
sight of him.

Clown:
Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.

Shepherd:
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.

Time:
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
To me or my swift passage, that I slide
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
Or what is now received: I witness to
The times that brought them in; so shall I do
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
The glistering of this present, as my tale
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
Gentle spectators, that I now may be
In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
I now name to you; and with speed so pace
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
I list not prophecy; but let Time's news
Be known when 'tis brought forth.
A shepherd's daughter,
And what to her adheres, which follows after,
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
If never, yet that Time himself doth say
He wishes earnestly you never may.

POLIXENES:
I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
grant this.

CAMILLO:
It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
think so, which is another spur to my departure.

POLIXENES:
As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to
have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
made me businesses which none without thee can
sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
them thyself or take away with thee the very
services thou hast done; which if I have not enough
considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen
and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
being gracious, than they are in losing them when
they have approved their virtues.

CAMILLO:
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
from court and is less frequent to his princely
exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

POLIXENES:
I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.

CAMILLO:
I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.

POLIXENES:
That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I
fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not
appearing what we are, have some question with the
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I willingly obey your command.

POLIXENES:
My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.

AUTOLYCUS:
When daffodils begin to peer,
With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
While we lie tumbling in the hay.
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:
But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
The pale moon shines by night:
And when I wander here and there,
I then do most go right.
If tinkers may have leave to live,
And bear the sow-skin budget,
Then my account I well may, give,
And in the stocks avouch it.
My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is
the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought
of it. A prize! a prize!

Clown:
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
shorn. what comes the wool to?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
raisins o' the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
O that ever I was born!

Clown:
I' the name of me--

AUTOLYCUS:
O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and
then, death, death!

Clown:
Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
on thee, rather than have these off.

AUTOLYCUS:
O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
ones and millions.

Clown:
Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
great matter.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
me.

Clown:
What, by a horseman, or a footman?

AUTOLYCUS:
A footman, sweet sir, a footman.

Clown:
Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, tenderly, O!

Clown:
Alas, poor soul!

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
shoulder-blade is out.

Clown:
How now! canst stand?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,
unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or
any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;
that kills my heart.

Clown:
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?

AUTOLYCUS:
A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.

Clown:
His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
there; and yet it will no more but abide.

AUTOLYCUS:
Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.

Clown:
Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
put me into this apparel.

Clown:
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.

AUTOLYCUS:
I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
him.

Clown:
How do you now?

AUTOLYCUS:
Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and
walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace
softly towards my kinsman's.

Clown:
Shall I bring thee on the way?

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.

Clown:
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
sheep-shearing.

AUTOLYCUS:
Prosper you, sweet sir!
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
make not this cheat bring out another and the
shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
put in the book of virtue!
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
And merrily hent the stile-a:
A merry heart goes all the day,
Your sad tires in a mile-a.

FLORIZEL:
These your unusual weeds to each part of you
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
And you the queen on't.

PERDITA:
Sir, my gracious lord,
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
In every mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
To show myself a glass.

FLORIZEL:
I bless the time
When my good falcon made her flight across
Thy father's ground.

PERDITA:
Now Jove afford you cause!
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
To think your father, by some accident,
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
How would he look, to see his work so noble
Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
The sternness of his presence?

FLORIZEL:
Apprehend
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
Humbling their deities to love, have taken
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
As I seem now. Their transformations
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
Burn hotter than my faith.

PERDITA:
O, but, sir,
Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
One of these two must be necessities,
Which then will speak, that you must
change this purpose,
Or I my life.

FLORIZEL:
Thou dearest Perdita,
With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
Or not my father's. For I cannot be
Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
Of celebration of that nuptial which
We two have sworn shall come.

PERDITA:
O lady Fortune,
Stand you auspicious!

FLORIZEL:
See, your guests approach:
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
And let's be red with mirth.

Shepherd:
Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
She would to each one sip. You are retired,
As if you were a feasted one and not
The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
A way to make us better friends, more known.
Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
As your good flock shall prosper.

PERDITA:

POLIXENES:
Shepherdess,
A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
With flowers of winter.

PERDITA:
Sir, the year growing ancient,
Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
Of trembling winter, the fairest
flowers o' the season
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
To get slips of them.

POLIXENES:
Wherefore, gentle maiden,
Do you neglect them?

PERDITA:
For I have heard it said
There is an art which in their piedness shares
With great creating nature.

POLIXENES:
Say there be;
Yet nature is made better by no mean
But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
Which you say adds to nature, is an art
That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
And make conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler race: this is an art
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
The art itself is nature.

PERDITA:
So it is.

POLIXENES:
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
And do not call them bastards.

PERDITA:
I'll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
No more than were I painted I would wish
This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
Of middle summer, and I think they are given
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.

CAMILLO:
I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
And only live by gazing.

PERDITA:
Out, alas!
You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
Would blow you through and through.
Now, my fair'st friend,
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
That die unmarried, ere they can behold
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
To strew him o'er and o'er!

FLORIZEL:
What, like a corse?

PERDITA:
No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition.

FLORIZEL:
What you do
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
Nothing but that; move still, still so,
And own no other function: each your doing,
So singular in each particular,
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
That all your acts are queens.

PERDITA:
O Doricles,
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
You woo'd me the false way.

FLORIZEL:
I think you have
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
That never mean to part.

PERDITA:
I'll swear for 'em.

POLIXENES:
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
But smacks of something greater than herself,
Too noble for this place.

CAMILLO:
He tells her something
That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
The queen of curds and cream.

Clown:
Come on, strike up!

DORCAS:
Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
To mend her kissing with!

MOPSA:
Now, in good time!

Clown:
Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
Come, strike up!

POLIXENES:
Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
Which dances with your daughter?

Shepherd:
They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
Upon his own report and I believe it;
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
I think so too; for never gazed the moon
Upon the water as he'll stand and read
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Who loves another best.

POLIXENES:
She dances featly.

Shepherd:
So she does any thing; though I report it,
That should be silent: if young Doricles
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
Which he not dreams of.

Servant:
O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
door, you would never dance again after a tabour and
pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
ears grew to his tunes.

Clown:
He could never come better; he shall come in. I
love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
indeed and sung lamentably.

Servant:
He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate
burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'

POLIXENES:
This is a brave fellow.

Clown:
Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?

Servant:
He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;
points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.

Clown:
Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.

PERDITA:
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.

Clown:
You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
than you'ld think, sister.

PERDITA:
Ay, good brother, or go about to think.

AUTOLYCUS:
Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
Masks for faces and for noses;
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
Perfume for a lady's chamber;
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give their dears:
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
What maids lack from head to heel:
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.

Clown:
If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.

MOPSA:
I was promised them against the feast; but they come
not too late now.

DORCAS:
He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.

MOPSA:
He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.

Clown:
Is there no manners left among maids? will they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
your tongues, and not a word more.

MOPSA:
I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
and a pair of sweet gloves.

Clown:
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
and lost all my money?

AUTOLYCUS:
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
therefore it behoves men to be wary.

Clown:
Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.

AUTOLYCUS:
I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.

Clown:
What hast here? ballads?

MOPSA:
Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
life, for then we are sure they are true.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
toads carbonadoed.

MOPSA:
Is it true, think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, and but a month old.

DORCAS:
Bless me from marrying a usurer!

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
present. Why should I carry lies abroad?

MOPSA:
Pray you now, buy it.

Clown:
Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.

DORCAS:
Is it true too, think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
my pack will hold.

Clown:
Lay it by too: another.

AUTOLYCUS:
This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.

MOPSA:
Let's have some merry ones.

AUTOLYCUS:
Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
request, I can tell you.

MOPSA:
We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.

DORCAS:
We had the tune on't a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS:
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
occupation; have at it with you.

AUTOLYCUS:
Get you hence, for I must go
Where it fits not you to know.

DORCAS:
Whither?

MOPSA:
O, whither?

DORCAS:
Whither?

MOPSA:
It becomes thy oath full well,
Thou to me thy secrets tell.

DORCAS:
Me too, let me go thither.

MOPSA:
Or thou goest to the orange or mill.

DORCAS:
If to either, thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
What, neither?

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
Thou hast sworn my love to be.

MOPSA:
Thou hast sworn it more to me:
Then whither goest? say, whither?

Clown:
We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's
have the first choice. Follow me, girls.

AUTOLYCUS:
And you shall pay well for 'em.
Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your head,
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
Come to the pedlar;
Money's a medler.
That doth utter all men's ware-a.

Servant:
Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made
themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it
be not too rough for some that know little but
bowling, it will please plentifully.

Shepherd:
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.

POLIXENES:
You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
these four threes of herdsmen.

Servant:
One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath
danced before the king; and not the worst of the
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.

Shepherd:
Leave your prating: since these good men are
pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.

Servant:
Why, they stay at door, sir.

POLIXENES:
O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
He's simple and tells much.
How now, fair shepherd!
Your heart is full of something that does take
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
And handed love as you do, I was wont
To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
To her acceptance; you have let him go
And nothing marted with him. If your lass
Interpretation should abuse and call this
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
For a reply, at least if you make a care
Of happy holding her.

FLORIZEL:
Old sir, I know
She prizes not such trifles as these are:
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
Up in my heart; which I have given already,
But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
snow that's bolted
By the northern blasts twice o'er.

POLIXENES:
What follows this?
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
But to your protestation; let me hear
What you profess.

FLORIZEL:
Do, and be witness to 't.

POLIXENES:
And this my neighbour too?

FLORIZEL:
And he, and more
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
Without her love; for her employ them all;
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Or to their own perdition.

POLIXENES:
Fairly offer'd.

CAMILLO:
This shows a sound affection.

Shepherd:
But, my daughter,
Say you the like to him?

PERDITA:
I cannot speak
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
The purity of his.

Shepherd:
Take hands, a bargain!
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
I give my daughter to him, and will make
Her portion equal his.

FLORIZEL:
O, that must be
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
Contract us 'fore these witnesses.

Shepherd:
Come, your hand;
And, daughter, yours.

POLIXENES:
Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
Have you a father?

FLORIZEL:
I have: but what of him?

POLIXENES:
Knows he of this?

FLORIZEL:
He neither does nor shall.

POLIXENES:
Methinks a father
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
Is not your father grown incapable
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
But what he did being childish?

FLORIZEL:
No, good sir;
He has his health and ampler strength indeed
Than most have of his age.

POLIXENES:
By my white beard,
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
Something unfilial: reason my son
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
The father, all whose joy is nothing else
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
In such a business.

FLORIZEL:
I yield all this;
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
My father of this business.

POLIXENES:
Let him know't.

FLORIZEL:
He shall not.

POLIXENES:
Prithee, let him.

FLORIZEL:
No, he must not.

Shepherd:
Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
At knowing of thy choice.

FLORIZEL:
Come, come, he must not.
Mark our contract.

POLIXENES:
Mark your divorce, young sir,
Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
The royal fool thou copest with,--

Shepherd:
O, my heart!

POLIXENES:
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
These rural latches to his entrance open,
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
I will devise a death as cruel for thee
As thou art tender to't.

PERDITA:
Even here undone!
I was not much afeard; for once or twice
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
Hides not his visage from our cottage but
Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
But milk my ewes and weep.

CAMILLO:
Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou diest.

Shepherd:
I cannot speak, nor think
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
You have undone a man of fourscore three,
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
To die upon the bed my father died,
To lie close by his honest bones: but now
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
That knew'st this was the prince,
and wouldst adventure
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
If I might die within this hour, I have lived
To die when I desire.

FLORIZEL:
Why look you so upon me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
More straining on for plucking back, not following
My leash unwillingly.

CAMILLO:
Gracious my lord,
You know your father's temper: at this time
He will allow no speech, which I do guess
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
Come not before him.

FLORIZEL:
I not purpose it.
I think, Camillo?

CAMILLO:
Even he, my lord.

PERDITA:
How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
How often said, my dignity would last
But till 'twere known!

FLORIZEL:
It cannot fail but by
The violation of my faith; and then
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
From my succession wipe me, father; I
Am heir to my affection.

CAMILLO:
Be advised.

FLORIZEL:
I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
Do bid it welcome.

CAMILLO:
This is desperate, sir.

FLORIZEL:
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
Tug for the time to come. This you may know
And so deliver, I am put to sea
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
And most opportune to our need I have
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
For this design. What course I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
Concern me the reporting.

CAMILLO:
O my lord!
I would your spirit were easier for advice,
Or stronger for your need.

FLORIZEL:
Hark, Perdita
I'll hear you by and by.

CAMILLO:
He's irremoveable,
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
His going I could frame to serve my turn,
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy king, my master, whom
I so much thirst to see.

FLORIZEL:
Now, good Camillo;
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I think
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
That I have borne your father?

FLORIZEL:
Very nobly
Have you deserved: it is my father's music
To speak your deeds, not little of his care
To have them recompensed as thought on.

CAMILLO:
Well, my lord,
If you may please to think I love the king
And through him what is nearest to him, which is
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
If your more ponderous and settled project
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
As shall become your highness; where you may
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
And bring him up to liking.

FLORIZEL:
How, Camillo,
May this, almost a miracle, be done?
That I may call thee something more than man
And after that trust to thee.

CAMILLO:
Have you thought on
A place whereto you'll go?

FLORIZEL:
Not any yet:
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blows.

CAMILLO:
Then list to me:
This follows, if you will not change your purpose
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
And there present yourself and your fair princess,
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
She shall be habited as it becomes
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or time.

FLORIZEL:
Worthy Camillo,
What colour for my visitation shall I
Hold up before him?

CAMILLO:
Sent by the king your father
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
The manner of your bearing towards him, with
What you as from your father shall deliver,
Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
What you must say; that he shall not perceive
But that you have your father's bosom there
And speak his very heart.

FLORIZEL:
I am bound to you:
There is some sap in this.

CAMILLO:
A cause more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
But as you shake off one to take another;
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
Do their best office, if they can but stay you
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
Prosperity's the very bond of love,
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters.

PERDITA:
One of these is true:
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
But not take in the mind.

CAMILLO:
Yea, say you so?
There shall not at your father's house these
seven years
Be born another such.

FLORIZEL:
My good Camillo,
She is as forward of her breeding as
She is i' the rear our birth.

CAMILLO:
I cannot say 'tis pity
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
To most that teach.

PERDITA:
Your pardon, sir; for this
I'll blush you thanks.

FLORIZEL:
My prettiest Perdita!
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
Preserver of my father, now of me,
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
To have you royally appointed as if
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
That you may know you shall not want, one word.

AUTOLYCUS:
Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
picture; and what I saw, to my good use I
remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
festival purses; and had not the old man come in
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
left a purse alive in the whole army.

CAMILLO:
Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

FLORIZEL:
And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--

CAMILLO:
Shall satisfy your father.

PERDITA:
Happy be you!
All that you speak shows fair.

CAMILLO:
Who have we here?
We'll make an instrument of this, omit
Nothing may give us aid.

AUTOLYCUS:
If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.

CAMILLO:
How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.

CAMILLO:
Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,
--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and
change garments with this gentleman: though the
pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,
there's some boot.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.
I know ye well enough.

CAMILLO:
Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
flayed already.

AUTOLYCUS:
Are you in earnest, sir?
I smell the trick on't.

FLORIZEL:
Dispatch, I prithee.

AUTOLYCUS:
Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
conscience take it.

CAMILLO:
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescried.

PERDITA:
I see the play so lies
That I must bear a part.

CAMILLO:
No remedy.
Have you done there?

FLORIZEL:
Should I now meet my father,
He would not call me son.

CAMILLO:
Nay, you shall have no hat.
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.

AUTOLYCUS:
Adieu, sir.

FLORIZEL:
O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
Pray you, a word.

CAMILLO:

FLORIZEL:
Fortune speed us!
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.

CAMILLO:
The swifter speed the better.

AUTOLYCUS:
I understand the business, I hear it: to have an
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
What an exchange had this been without boot! What
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
iniquity, stealing away from his father with his
clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
and therein am I constant to my profession.
Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:
every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
hanging, yields a careful man work.

Clown:
See, see; what a man you are now!
There is no other way but to tell the king
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.

Shepherd:
Nay, but hear me.

Clown:
Nay, but hear me.

Shepherd:
Go to, then.

Clown:
She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
and blood has not offended the king; and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
those things you found about her, those secret
things, all but what she has with her: this being
done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.

Shepherd:
I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his
son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,
neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make
me the king's brother-in-law.

Clown:
Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
could have been to him and then your blood had been
the dearer by I know how much an ounce.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
Well, let us to the king: there is that in this
fardel will make him scratch his beard.

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Pray heartily he be at palace.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
To the palace, an it like your worship.

AUTOLYCUS:
Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
thing that is fitting to be known, discover.

Clown:
We are but plain fellows, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
they do not give us the lie.

Clown:
Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
had not taken yourself with the manner.

Shepherd:
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
open thy affair.

Shepherd:
My business, sir, is to the king.

AUTOLYCUS:
What advocate hast thou to him?

Shepherd:
I know not, an't like you.

Clown:
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
have none.

Shepherd:
None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.

AUTOLYCUS:
How blessed are we that are not simple men!
Yet nature might have made me as these are,
Therefore I will not disdain.

Clown:
This cannot be but a great courtier.

Shepherd:
His garments are rich, but he wears
them not handsomely.

Clown:
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking
on's teeth.

AUTOLYCUS:
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
Wherefore that box?

Shepherd:
Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
which none must know but the king; and which he
shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
speech of him.

AUTOLYCUS:
Age, thou hast lost thy labour.

Shepherd:
Why, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
know the king is full of grief.

Shepard:
So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have
married a shepherd's daughter.

AUTOLYCUS:
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.

Clown:
Think you so, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
under the hangman: which though it be great pity,
yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.

Clown:
Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters
and a dram dead; then recovered again with
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as
he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
are to be smiled at, their offences being so
capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
men, what you have to the king: being something
gently considered, I'll bring you where he is
aboard, tender your persons to his presence,
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
besides the king to effect your suits, here is man
shall do it.

Clown:
He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn
bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

Shepherd:
An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for
us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much
more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.

AUTOLYCUS:
After I have done what I promised?

Shepherd:
Ay, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?

Clown:
In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful
one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
he'll be made an example.

Clown:
Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
will give you as much as this old man does when the
business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
pawn till it be brought you.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
hedge and follow you.

Clown:
We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.

Shepherd:
Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.

AUTOLYCUS:
If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
think it fit to shore them again and that the
complaint they have to the king concerns him
nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
officious; for I am proof against that title and
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
them: there may be matter in it.

CLEOMENES:
Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
With them forgive yourself.

LEONTES:
Whilst I remember
Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
My blemishes in them, and so still think of
The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
Bred his hopes out of.

PAULINA:
True, too true, my lord:
If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
Or from the all that are took something good,
To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
Would be unparallel'd.

LEONTES:
I think so. Kill'd!
She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
Say so but seldom.

CLEOMENES:
Not at all, good lady:
You might have spoken a thousand things that would
Have done the time more benefit and graced
Your kindness better.

PAULINA:
You are one of those
Would have him wed again.

DION:
If you would not so,
You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
Of his most sovereign name; consider little
What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
May drop upon his kingdom and devour
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
What holier than, for royalty's repair,
For present comfort and for future good,
To bless the bed of majesty again
With a sweet fellow to't?

PAULINA:
There is none worthy,
Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
For has not the divine Apollo said,
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
That King Leontes shall not have an heir
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
Is all as monstrous to our human reason
As my Antigonus to break his grave
And come again to me; who, on my life,
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
Oppose against their wills.
Care not for issue;
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
Was like to be the best.

LEONTES:
Good Paulina,
Who hast the memory of Hermione,
I know, in honour, O, that ever I
Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
Have taken treasure from her lips--

PAULINA:
And left them
More rich for what they yielded.

LEONTES:
Thou speak'st truth.
No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
And better used, would make her sainted spirit
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And begin, 'Why to me?'

PAULINA:
Had she such power,
She had just cause.

LEONTES:
She had; and would incense me
To murder her I married.

PAULINA:
I should so.
Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
Should be 'Remember mine.'

LEONTES:
Stars, stars,
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
I'll have no wife, Paulina.

PAULINA:
Will you swear
Never to marry but by my free leave?

LEONTES:
Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!

PAULINA:
Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.

CLEOMENES:
You tempt him over-much.

PAULINA:
Unless another,
As like Hermione as is her picture,
Affront his eye.

CLEOMENES:
Good madam,--

PAULINA:
I have done.
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
As was your former; but she shall be such
As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
it should take joy
To see her in your arms.

LEONTES:
My true Paulina,
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.

PAULINA:
That
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
Never till then.

Gentleman:
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
To your high presence.

LEONTES:
What with him? he comes not
Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
By need and accident. What train?

Gentleman:
But few,
And those but mean.

LEONTES:
His princess, say you, with him?

Gentleman:
Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
That e'er the sun shone bright on.

PAULINA:
O Hermione,
As every present time doth boast itself
Above a better gone, so must thy grave
Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
Have said and writ so, but your writing now
Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
To say you have seen a better.

Gentleman:
Pardon, madam:
The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
Of all professors else, make proselytes
Of who she but bid follow.

PAULINA:
How! not women?

Gentleman:
Women will love her, that she is a woman
More worth than any man; men, that she is
The rarest of all women.

LEONTES:
Go, Cleomenes;
Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
He thus should steal upon us.

PAULINA:
Had our prince,
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
Well with this lord: there was not full a month
Between their births.

LEONTES:
Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
Will bring me to consider that which may
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
For she did print your royal father off,
Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
Your father's image is so hit in you,
His very air, that I should call you brother,
As I did him, and speak of something wildly
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
All mine own folly--the society,
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
Though bearing misery, I desire my life
Once more to look on him.

FLORIZEL:
By his command
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
His wish'd ability, he had himself
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
And those that bear them living.

LEONTES:
O my brother,
Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
So rarely kind, are as interpreters
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
The adventure of her person?

FLORIZEL:
Good my lord,
She came from Libya.

LEONTES:
Where the warlike Smalus,
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?

FLORIZEL:
Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
To execute the charge my father gave me
For visiting your highness: my best train
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
Not only my success in Libya, sir,
But my arrival and my wife's in safety
Here where we are.

LEONTES:
The blessed gods
Purge all infection from our air whilst you
Do climate here! You have a holy father,
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
For which the heavens, taking angry note,
Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
As he from heaven merits it, with you
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
Such goodly things as you!

Lord:
Most noble sir,
That which I shall report will bear no credit,
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
Desires you to attach his son, who has--
His dignity and duty both cast off--
Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
A shepherd's daughter.

LEONTES:
Where's Bohemia? speak.

Lord:
Here in your city; I now came from him:
I speak amazedly; and it becomes
My marvel and my message. To your court
Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
The father of this seeming lady and
Her brother, having both their country quitted
With this young prince.

FLORIZEL:
Camillo has betray'd me;
Whose honour and whose honesty till now
Endured all weathers.

Lord:
Lay't so to his charge:
He's with the king your father.

LEONTES:
Who? Camillo?

Lord:
Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
With divers deaths in death.

PERDITA:
O my poor father!
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
Our contract celebrated.

LEONTES:
You are married?

FLORIZEL:
We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
The odds for high and low's alike.

LEONTES:
My lord,
Is this the daughter of a king?

FLORIZEL:
She is,
When once she is my wife.

LEONTES:
That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
That you might well enjoy her.

FLORIZEL:
Dear, look up:
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
Should chase us with my father, power no jot
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
Remember since you owed no more to time
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
Step forth mine advocate; at your request
My father will grant precious things as trifles.

LEONTES:
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
Which he counts but a trifle.

PAULINA:
Sir, my liege,
Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
Than what you look on now.

LEONTES:
I thought of her,
Even in these looks I made.
But your petition
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
I now go toward him; therefore follow me
And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.

AUTOLYCUS:
Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?

First Gentleman:
I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
heard the shepherd say, he found the child.

AUTOLYCUS:
I would most gladly know the issue of it.

First Gentleman:
I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
extremity of the one, it must needs be.
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
The news, Rogero?

Second Gentleman:
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
cannot be able to express it.
Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
which is called true is so like an old tale, that
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
found his heir?

Third Gentleman:
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
know to be his character, the majesty of the
creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
and many other evidences proclaim her with all
certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
the meeting of the two kings?

Second Gentleman:
No.

Third Gentleman:
Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
holding up of hands, with countenances of such
distraction that they were to be known by garment,
not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,
thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
another encounter, which lames report to follow it
and undoes description to do it.

Second Gentleman:
What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
hence the child?

Third Gentleman:
Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.

First Gentleman:
What became of his bark and his followers?

Third Gentleman:
Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
instruments which aided to expose the child were
even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
of losing.

First Gentleman:
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes; for by such was it acted.

Third Gentleman:
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's
death, with the manner how she came to't bravely
confessed and lamented by the king, how
attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one
sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.

First Gentleman:
Are they returned to the court?

Third Gentleman:
No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
eternity and could put breath into his work, would
beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
answer: thither with all greediness of affection
are they gone, and there they intend to sup.

Second Gentleman:
I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
the rejoicing?

First Gentleman:
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
Let's along.

AUTOLYCUS:
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
so he then took her to be, who began to be much
sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
weather continuing, this mystery remained
undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
been the finder out of this secret, it would not
have relished among my other discredits.
Here come those I have done good to against my will,
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.

Shepherd:
Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and
daughters will be all gentlemen born.

Clown:
You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
See you these clothes? say you see them not and
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.

AUTOLYCUS:
I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

Clown:
Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.

Shepherd:
And so have I, boy.

Clown:
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
called me brother; and then the two kings called my
father brother; and then the prince my brother and
the princess my sister called my father father; and
so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
tears that ever we shed.

Shepherd:
We may live, son, to shed many more.

Clown:
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
preposterous estate as we are.

AUTOLYCUS:
I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
faults I have committed to your worship and to give
me your good report to the prince my master.

Shepherd:
Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are
gentlemen.

Clown:
Thou wilt amend thy life?

AUTOLYCUS:
Ay, an it like your good worship.

Clown:
Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.

Shepherd:
You may say it, but not swear it.

Clown:
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
franklins say it, I'll swear it.

Shepherd:
How if it be false, son?

Clown:
If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of thy hands.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will prove so, sir, to my power.

Clown:
Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
good masters.

LEONTES:
O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
That I have had of thee!

PAULINA:
What, sovereign sir,
I did not well I meant well. All my services
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
It is a surplus of your grace, which never
My life may last to answer.

LEONTES:
O Paulina,
We honour you with trouble: but we came
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
Have we pass'd through, not without much content
In many singularities; but we saw not
That which my daughter came to look upon,
The statue of her mother.

PAULINA:
As she lived peerless,
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.
I like your silence, it the more shows off
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
Comes it not something near?

LEONTES:
Her natural posture!
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this seems.

POLIXENES:
O, not by much.

PAULINA:
So much the more our carver's excellence;
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
As she lived now.

LEONTES:
As now she might have done,
So much to my good comfort, as it is
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
There's magic in thy majesty, which has
My evils conjured to remembrance and
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
Standing like stone with thee.

PERDITA:
And give me leave,
And do not say 'tis superstition, that
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

PAULINA:
O, patience!
The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.

CAMILLO:
My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
So many summers dry; scarce any joy
Did ever so long live; no sorrow
But kill'd itself much sooner.

POLIXENES:
Dear my brother,
Let him that was the cause of this have power
To take off so much grief from you as he
Will piece up in himself.

PAULINA:
Indeed, my lord,
If I had thought the sight of my poor image
Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
I'ld not have show'd it.

LEONTES:
Do not draw the curtain.

PAULINA:
No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
May think anon it moves.

LEONTES:
Let be, let be.
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
Did verily bear blood?

POLIXENES:
Masterly done:
The very life seems warm upon her lip.

LEONTES:
The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
As we are mock'd with art.

PAULINA:
I'll draw the curtain:
My lord's almost so far transported that
He'll think anon it lives.

LEONTES:
O sweet Paulina,
Make me to think so twenty years together!
No settled senses of the world can match
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.

PAULINA:
I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
I could afflict you farther.

LEONTES:
Do, Paulina;
For this affliction has a taste as sweet
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
For I will kiss her.

PAULINA:
Good my lord, forbear:
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

LEONTES:
No, not these twenty years.

PERDITA:
So long could I
Stand by, a looker on.

PAULINA:
Either forbear,
Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
For more amazement. If you can behold it,
I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
Which I protest against--I am assisted
By wicked powers.

LEONTES:
What you can make her do,
I am content to look on: what to speak,
I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
To make her speak as move.

PAULINA:
It is required
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
On: those that think it is unlawful business
I am about, let them depart.

LEONTES:
Proceed:
No foot shall stir.

PAULINA:
Music, awake her; strike!
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
Start not; her actions shall be holy as
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
Until you see her die again; for then
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
Is she become the suitor?

LEONTES:
O, she's warm!
If this be magic, let it be an art
Lawful as eating.

POLIXENES:
She embraces him.

CAMILLO:
She hangs about his neck:
If she pertain to life let her speak too.

POLIXENES:
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
Or how stolen from the dead.

PAULINA:
That she is living,
Were it but told you, should be hooted at
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
Our Perdita is found.

HERMIONE:
You gods, look down
And from your sacred vials pour your graces
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
Myself to see the issue.

PAULINA:
There's time enough for that;
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Your joys with like relation. Go together,
You precious winners all; your exultation
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
My mate, that's never to be found again,
Lament till I am lost.

LEONTES:
O, peace, Paulina!
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
Is richly noted and here justified
By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
That e'er I put between your holy looks
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
Each one demand an answer to his part
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Escalus.

ESCALUS:
My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government the properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you: then no more remains,
But that to your sufficiency, as your Worth is able,
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
As art and practise hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
I say, bid come before us Angelo.
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know, we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply,
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power: what think you of it?

ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Look where he comes.

ANGELO:
Always obedient to your grace's will,
I come to know your pleasure.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life,
That to the observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo:--
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.

ANGELO:
Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No more evasion:
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us, and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.

ANGELO:
Yet give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
I'll privily away. I love the people,
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
Through it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

ANGELO:
The heavens give safety to your purposes!

ESCALUS:
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

DUKE:
I thank you. Fare you well.

ESCALUS:
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place:
A power I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed.

ANGELO:
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point.

ESCALUS:
I'll wait upon your honour.

LUCIO:
If the duke with the other dukes come not to
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
the dukes fall upon the king.

First Gentleman:
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
Hungary's!

Second Gentleman:
Amen.

LUCIO:
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
one out of the table.

Second Gentleman:
'Thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO:
Ay, that he razed.

First Gentleman:
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
all the rest from their functions: they put forth
to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
well that prays for peace.

Second Gentleman:
I never heard any soldier dislike it.

LUCIO:
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
grace was said.

Second Gentleman:
No? a dozen times at least.

First Gentleman:
What, in metre?

LUCIO:
In any proportion or in any language.

First Gentleman:
I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO:
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
wicked villain, despite of all grace.

First Gentleman:
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

LUCIO:
I grant; as there may between the lists and the
velvet. Thou art the list.

First Gentleman:
And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
feelingly now?

LUCIO:
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
live, forget to drink after thee.

First Gentleman:
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

Second Gentleman:
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.

LUCIO:
Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--

Second Gentleman:
To what, I pray?

LUCIO:
Judge.

Second Gentleman:
To three thousand dolours a year.

First Gentleman:
Ay, and more.

LUCIO:
A French crown more.

First Gentleman:
Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
art full of error; I am sound.

LUCIO:
Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of thee.

First Gentleman:
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

Second Gentleman:
Who's that, I pray thee?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

First Gentleman:
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
him carried away; and, which is more, within these
three days his head to be chopped off.

LUCIO:
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
Art thou sure of this?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child.

LUCIO:
Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
hours since, and he was ever precise in
promise-keeping.

Second Gentleman:
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose.

First Gentleman:
But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.

LUCIO:
Away! let's go learn the truth of it.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
custom-shrunk.
How now! what's the news with you?

POMPEY:
Yonder man is carried to prison.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well; what has he done?

POMPEY:
A woman.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But what's his offence?

POMPEY:
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What, is there a maid with child by him?

POMPEY:
No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
not heard of the proclamation, have you?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What proclamation, man?

POMPEY:
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
And what shall become of those in the city?

POMPEY:
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
but that a wise burgher put in for them.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pulled down?

POMPEY:
To the ground, mistress.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become of me?

POMPEY:
Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
clients: though you change your place, you need not
change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
will be considered.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.

POMPEY:
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
prison; and there's Madam Juliet.

CLAUDIO:
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

Provost:
I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

CLAUDIO:
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

LUCIO:
Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?

CLAUDIO:
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
As surfeit is the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

LUCIO:
If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
What but to speak of would offend again.

LUCIO:
What, is't murder?

CLAUDIO:
No.

LUCIO:
Lechery?

CLAUDIO:
Call it so.

Provost:
Away, sir! you must go.

CLAUDIO:
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

LUCIO:
A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?

CLAUDIO:
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order: this we came not to,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

LUCIO:
With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
Unhappily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the duke--
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his emmence that fills it up,
I stagger in:--but this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

LUCIO:
I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
him.

CLAUDIO:
I have done so, but he's not to be found.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should the cloister enter
And there receive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect,
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well she can persuade.

LUCIO:
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
like, which else would stand under grievous
imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

CLAUDIO:
I thank you, good friend Lucio.

LUCIO:
Within two hours.

CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS:
May your grace speak of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever loved the life removed
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this?

FRIAR THOMAS:
Gladly, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum.

FRIAR THOMAS:
It rested in your grace
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do fear, too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo imposed the office;
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you;
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

ISABELLA:
And have you nuns no farther privileges?

FRANCISCA:
Are not these large enough?

ISABELLA:
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Who's that which calls?

FRANCISCA:
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
But in the presence of the prioress:
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
He calls again; I pray you, answer him.

ISABELLA:
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls

LUCIO:
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?

ISABELLA:
Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
The rather for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister.

LUCIO:
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

ISABELLA:
Woe me! for what?

LUCIO:
For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He hath got his friend with child.

ISABELLA:
Sir, make me not your story.

LUCIO:
It is true.
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.

ISABELLA:
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

LUCIO:
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Your brother and his lover have embraced:
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

ISABELLA:
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

LUCIO:
Is she your cousin?

ISABELLA:
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
By vain though apt affection.

LUCIO:
She it is.

ISABELLA:
O, let him marry her.

LUCIO:
This is the point.
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
By those that know the very nerves of state,
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
And with full line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
He--to give fear to use and liberty,
Which have for long run by the hideous law,
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And follows close the rigour of the statute,
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
'Twixt you and your poor brother.

ISABELLA:
Doth he so seek his life?

LUCIO:
Has censured him
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
A warrant for his execution.

ISABELLA:
Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good?

LUCIO:
Assay the power you have.

ISABELLA:
My power? Alas, I doubt--

LUCIO:
Our doubts are traitors
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.

ISABELLA:
I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO:
But speedily.

ISABELLA:
I will about it straight;
No longer staying but to give the mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
Commend me to my brother: soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.

LUCIO:
I take my leave of you.

ISABELLA:
Good sir, adieu.

ANGELO:
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
Their perch and not their terror.

ESCALUS:
Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
That, in the working of your own affections,
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of your blood
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
And pull'd the law upon you.

ANGELO:
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I not deny,
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
That justice seizes: what know the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
Because we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

ESCALUS:
Be it as your wisdom will.

ANGELO:
Where is the provost?

Provost:
Here, if it like your honour.

ANGELO:
See that Claudio
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

ESCALUS:

ELBOW:
Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
common houses, I know no law: bring them away.

ANGELO:
How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?

ELBOW:
If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
honour two notorious benefactors.

ANGELO:
Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
they not malefactors?

ELBOW:
If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
of; and void of all profanation in the world that
good Christians ought to have.

ESCALUS:
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

ANGELO:
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?

POMPEY:
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.

ANGELO:
What are you, sir?

ELBOW:
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS:
How know you that?

ELBOW:
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--

ESCALUS:
How? thy wife?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--

ESCALUS:
Dost thou detest her therefore?

ELBOW:
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS:
How dost thou know that, constable?

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
cardinally given, might have been accused in
fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.

ESCALUS:
By the woman's means?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
spit in his face, so she defied him.

POMPEY:
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.

ELBOW:
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
man; prove it.

ESCALUS:
Do you hear how he misplaces?

POMPEY:
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;
sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
good dishes,--

ESCALUS:
Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.

POMPEY:
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
the right: but to the point. As I say, this
Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
not give you three-pence again.

FROTH:
No, indeed.

POMPEY:
Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--

FROTH:
Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY:
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
good diet, as I told you,--

FROTH:
All this is true.

POMPEY:
Why, very well, then,--

ESCALUS:
Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
complain of? Come me to what was done to her.

POMPEY:
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.

ESCALUS:
No, sir, nor I mean it not.

POMPEY:
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
Master Froth?

FROTH:
All-hallond eve.

POMPEY:
Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
to sit, have you not?

FROTH:
I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.

POMPEY:
Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO:
This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

ESCALUS:
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?

POMPEY:
Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.

ELBOW:
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY:
I beseech your honour, ask me.

ESCALUS:
Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?

POMPEY:
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?

ESCALUS:
Ay, sir, very well.

POMPEY:
Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.

ESCALUS:
Well, I do so.

POMPEY:
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?

ESCALUS:
Why, no.

POMPEY:
I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
your honour.

ESCALUS:
He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?

ELBOW:
First, an it like you, the house is a respected
house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
mistress is a respected woman.

POMPEY:
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
person than any of us all.

ELBOW:
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
time has yet to come that she was ever respected
with man, woman, or child.

POMPEY:
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.

ESCALUS:
Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
this true?

ELBOW:
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
with me, let not your worship think me the poor
duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
I'll have mine action of battery on thee.

ESCALUS:
If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
action of slander too.

ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS:
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
are.

ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.

ESCALUS:
Where were you born, friend?

FROTH:
Here in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS:
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?

FROTH:
Yes, an't please you, sir.

ESCALUS:
So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPHEY:
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS:
Your mistress' name?

POMPHEY:
Mistress Overdone.

ESCALUS:
Hath she had any more than one husband?

POMPEY:
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS:
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
more of you.

FROTH:
I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
in.

ESCALUS:
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
name, Master tapster?

POMPEY:
Pompey.

ESCALUS:
What else?

POMPEY:
Bum, sir.

ESCALUS:
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.

ESCALUS:
How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?

POMPEY:
If the law would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS:
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
not be allowed in Vienna.

POMPEY:
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
youth of the city?

ESCALUS:
No, Pompey.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
If your worship will take order for the drabs and
the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.

ESCALUS:
There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
it is but heading and hanging.

POMPEY:
If you head and hang all that offend that way but
for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
commission for more heads: if this law hold in
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
come to pass, say Pompey told you so.

ESCALUS:
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

POMPEY:
I thank your worship for your good counsel:
but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall
better determine.
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.

ESCALUS:
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?

ELBOW:
Seven year and a half, sir.

ESCALUS:
I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?

ELBOW:
And a half, sir.

ESCALUS:
Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
in your ward sufficient to serve it?

ELBOW:
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
do it for some piece of money, and go through with
all.

ESCALUS:
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
the most sufficient of your parish.

ELBOW:
To your worship's house, sir?

ESCALUS:
To my house. Fare you well.
What's o'clock, think you?

Justice:
Eleven, sir.

ESCALUS:
I pray you home to dinner with me.

Justice:
I humbly thank you.

ESCALUS:
It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
But there's no remedy.

Justice:
Lord Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS:
It is but needful:
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.

Servant:
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
I'll tell him of you.

Provost:
Pray you, do.
I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
To die for't!

ANGELO:
Now, what's the matter. Provost?

Provost:
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?

ANGELO:
Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?

Provost:
Lest I might be too rash:
Under your good correction, I have seen,
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er his doom.

ANGELO:
Go to; let that be mine:
Do you your office, or give up your place,
And you shall well be spared.

Provost:
I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.

ANGELO:
Dispose of her
To some more fitter place, and that with speed.

Servant:
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
Desires access to you.

ANGELO:
Hath he a sister?

Provost:
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
If not already.

ANGELO:
Well, let her be admitted.
See you the fornicatress be removed:
Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
There shall be order for't.

Provost:
God save your honour!

ANGELO:
Stay a little while.
You're welcome: what's your will?

ISABELLA:
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
Please but your honour hear me.

ANGELO:
Well; what's your suit?

ISABELLA:
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For which I must not plead, but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not.

ANGELO:
Well; the matter?

ISABELLA:
I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
And not my brother.

Provost:

ANGELO:
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
Mine were the very cipher of a function,
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
And let go by the actor.

ISABELLA:
O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Must he needs die?

ANGELO:
Maiden, no remedy.

ISABELLA:
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

ANGELO:
I will not do't.

ISABELLA:
But can you, if you would?

ANGELO:
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

ISABELLA:
But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
As mine is to him?

ANGELO:
He's sentenced; 'tis too late.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
May call it back again. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been as you and you as he,
You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
Would not have been so stern.

ANGELO:
Pray you, be gone.

ISABELLA:
I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
And what a prisoner.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
And you but waste your words.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be,
If He, which is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
Like man new made.

ANGELO:
Be you content, fair maid;
It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
There's many have committed it.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
Those many had not dared to do that evil,
If the first that did the edict infringe
Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
Are now to have no successive degrees,
But, ere they live, to end.

ISABELLA:
Yet show some pity.

ANGELO:
I show it most of all when I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA:
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
For every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Drest in a little brief authority,
Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
Would all themselves laugh mortal.

LUCIO:

Provost:

ISABELLA:
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
But in the less foul profanation.

LUCIO:
Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.

ISABELLA:
That in the captain's but a choleric word,
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Why do you put these sayings upon me?

ISABELLA:
Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brother's life.

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO:
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.

ANGELO:
How! bribe me?

ISABELLA:
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.

ANGELO:
Well; come to me to-morrow.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Heaven keep your honour safe!

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
At what hour to-morrow
Shall I attend your lordship?

ANGELO:
At any time 'fore noon.

ISABELLA:
'Save your honour!

ANGELO:
From thee, even from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good? O, let her brother live!
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quite. Even till now,
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.

Provost:
I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly.

Provost:
I would do more than that, if more were needful.
Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
More fit to do another such offence
Than die for this.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
When must he die?

Provost:
As I do think, to-morrow.
I have provided for you: stay awhile,
And you shall be conducted.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

JULIET:
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
And try your penitence, if it be sound,
Or hollowly put on.

JULIET:
I'll gladly learn.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love you the man that wrong'd you?

JULIET:
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed?

JULIET:
Mutually.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

JULIET:
I do confess it, and repent it, father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear,--

JULIET:
I do repent me, as it is an evil,
And take the shame with joy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you, Benedicite!

JULIET:
Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
That respites me a life, whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!

Provost:
'Tis pity of him.

ANGELO:
When I would pray and think, I think and pray
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
As if I did but only chew his name;
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
Is like a good thing, being often read,
Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
'Tis not the devil's crest.
How now! who's there?

Servant:
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ANGELO:
Teach her the way.
O heavens!
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
Making both it unable for itself,
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
By which he should revive: and even so
The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence.
How now, fair maid?

ISABELLA:
I am come to know your pleasure.

ANGELO:
That you might know it, would much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.

ISABELLA:
Even so. Heaven keep your honour!

ANGELO:
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you or I yet he must die.

ISABELLA:
Under your sentence?

ANGELO:
Yea.

ISABELLA:
When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not.

ANGELO:
Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.

ISABELLA:
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

ANGELO:
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather, that the most just law
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?

ISABELLA:
Sir, believe this,
I had rather give my body than my soul.

ANGELO:
I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.

ISABELLA:
How say you?

ANGELO:
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother's life?

ISABELLA:
Please you to do't,
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO:
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA:
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your answer.

ANGELO:
Nay, but hear me.
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.

ISABELLA:
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
But graciously to know I am no better.

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
Your brother is to die.

ISABELLA:
So.

ANGELO:
And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain.

ISABELLA:
True.

ANGELO:
Admit no other way to save his life,--
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
Finding yourself desired of such a person,
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the all-building law; and that there were
No earthly mean to save him, but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
What would you do?

ISABELLA:
As much for my poor brother as myself:
That is, were I under the terms of death,
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
And strip myself to death, as to a bed
That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
My body up to shame.

ANGELO:
Then must your brother die.

ISABELLA:
And 'twere the cheaper way:
Better it were a brother died at once,
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Should die for ever.

ANGELO:
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you have slander'd so?

ISABELLA:
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

ANGELO:
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather proved the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice.

ISABELLA:
O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
I something do excuse the thing I hate,
For his advantage that I dearly love.

ANGELO:
We are all frail.

ISABELLA:
Else let my brother die,
If not a feodary, but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO:
Nay, women are frail too.

ISABELLA:
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
For we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO:
I think it well:
And from this testimony of your own sex,--
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
If you be one, as you are well express'd
By all external warrants, show it now,
By putting on the destined livery.

ISABELLA:
I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
Let me entreat you speak the former language.

ANGELO:
Plainly conceive, I love you.

ISABELLA:
My brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall die for it.

ANGELO:
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

ISABELLA:
I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
To pluck on others.

ANGELO:
Believe me, on mine honour,
My words express my purpose.

ISABELLA:
Ha! little honour to be much believed,
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
What man thou art.

ANGELO:
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
Will so your accusation overweigh,
That you shall stifle in your own report
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he must not only die the death,
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.

ISABELLA:
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
Either of condemnation or approof;
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
Before his sister should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

CLAUDIO:
The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope:
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.

CLAUDIO:
I humbly thank you.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

ISABELLA:

Provost:
Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.

CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I thank you.

ISABELLA:
My business is a word or two with Claudio.

Provost:
And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, a word with you.

Provost:
As many as you please.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.

CLAUDIO:
Now, sister, what's the comfort?

ISABELLA:
Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set on.

CLAUDIO:
Is there no remedy?

ISABELLA:
None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain.

CLAUDIO:
But is there any?

ISABELLA:
Yes, brother, you may live:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
But fetter you till death.

CLAUDIO:
Perpetual durance?

ISABELLA:
Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
To a determined scope.

CLAUDIO:
But in what nature?

ISABELLA:
In such a one as, you consenting to't,
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
And leave you naked.

CLAUDIO:
Let me know the point.

ISABELLA:
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO:
Why give you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride,
And hug it in mine arms.

ISABELLA:
There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.

CLAUDIO:
The prenzie Angelo!

ISABELLA:
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
The damned'st body to invest and cover
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou mightst be freed.

CLAUDIO:
O heavens! it cannot be.

ISABELLA:
Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest to-morrow.

CLAUDIO:
Thou shalt not do't.

ISABELLA:
O, were it but my life,
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin.

CLAUDIO:
Thanks, dear Isabel.

ISABELLA:
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

CLAUDIO:
Yes. Has he affections in him,
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.

ISABELLA:
Which is the least?

CLAUDIO:
If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

ISABELLA:
What says my brother?

CLAUDIO:
Death is a fearful thing.

ISABELLA:
And shamed life a hateful.

CLAUDIO:
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO:
Sweet sister, let me live:
What sin you do to save a brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue.

ISABELLA:
O you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word to save thee.

CLAUDIO:
Nay, hear me, Isabel.

ISABELLA:
O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
'Tis best thou diest quickly.

CLAUDIO:
O hear me, Isabella!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

ISABELLA:
What is your will?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
would require is likewise your own benefit.

ISABELLA:
I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
your knees and make ready.

CLAUDIO:
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
with life that I will sue to be rid of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hold you there: farewell.
Provost, a word with you!

Provost:
What's your will, father

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.

Provost:
In good time.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
substitute, and to save your brother?

ISABELLA:
I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
brother die by the law than my son should be
unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
discover his government.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
person; and much please the absent duke, if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
this business.

ISABELLA:
Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?

ISABELLA:
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
which time of the contract and limit of the
solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

ISABELLA:
Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
is washed with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA:
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
from the world! What corruption in this life, that
it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
you from dishonour in doing it.

ISABELLA:
Show me how, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
like an impediment in the current, made it more
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
This being granted in course,--and now follows
all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
What think you of it?

ISABELLA:
The image of it gives me content already; and I
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
it may be quickly.

ISABELLA:
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.

ELBOW:
Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O heavens! what stuff is here

POMPEY:
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and
furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.

ELBOW:
Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you, good brother father. What offence hath
this man made you, sir?

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
sent to the deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

POMPEY:
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
sir, I would prove--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit.

ELBOW:
He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
as good go a mile on his errand.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That we were all, as some would seem to be,
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!

ELBOW:
His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.

POMPEY:
I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
friend of mine.

LUCIO:
How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
trick of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Still thus, and thus; still worse!

LUCIO:
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
still, ha?

POMPEY:
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
is herself in the tub.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
to prison, Pompey?

POMPEY:
Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?

ELBOW:
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

LUCIO:
Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
will keep the house.

POMPEY:
I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

LUCIO:
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you.

LUCIO:
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.

POMPEY:
You will not bail me, then, sir?

LUCIO:
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
what news?

ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.

LUCIO:
Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
What news, friar, of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know none. Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO:
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.

LUCIO:
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
puts transgression to 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He does well in 't.

LUCIO:
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
him: something too crabbed that way, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.

LUCIO:
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
woman after this downright way of creation: is it
true, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How should he be made, then?

LUCIO:
Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
certain that when he makes water his urine is
congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
motion generative; that's infallible.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

LUCIO:
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I never heard the absent duke much detected for
women; he was not inclined that way.

LUCIO:
O, sir, you are deceived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis not possible.

LUCIO:
Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
that let me inform you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO:
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
withdrawing.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, I prithee, might be the cause?

LUCIO:
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
understand, the greater file of the subject held the
duke to be wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! why, no question but he was.

LUCIO:
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
the very stream of his life and the business he hath
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.

LUCIO:
Sir, I know him, and I love him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
dearer love.

LUCIO:
Come, sir, I know what I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
upon you; and, I pray you, your name?

LUCIO:
Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
report you.

LUCIO:
I fear you not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.

LUCIO:
I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
Claudio die to-morrow or no?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why should he die, sir?

LUCIO:
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
the duke we talk of were returned again: the
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
continency; sparrows must not build in his
house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
never bring them to light: would he were returned!
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
But who comes here?

ESCALUS:
Go; away with her to prison!

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
a merciful man; good my lord.

ESCALUS:
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
the tyrant.

Provost:
A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
your honour.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!

ESCALUS:
That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
no more words.
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
so with him.

Provost:
So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
advised him for the entertainment of death.

ESCALUS:
Good even, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bliss and goodness on you!

ESCALUS:
Of whence are you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not of this country, though my chance is now
To use it for my time: I am a brother
Of gracious order, late come from the See
In special business from his holiness.

ESCALUS:
What news abroad i' the world?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
None, but that there is so great a fever on
goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?

ESCALUS:
One that, above all other strifes, contended
especially to know himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What pleasure was he given to?

ESCALUS:
Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
prepared. I am made to understand that you have
lent him visitation.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He professes to have received no sinister measure
from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
resolved to die.

ESCALUS:
You have paid the heavens your function, and the
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
If his own life answer the straitness of his
proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

ESCALUS:
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Peace be with you!
He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself to know,
Grace to stand, and virtue go;
More nor less to others paying
Than by self-offences weighing.
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own liking!
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what may man within him hide,
Though angel on the outward side!
How may likeness made in crimes,
Making practise on the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most ponderous and substantial things!
Craft against vice I must apply:
With Angelo to-night shall lie
His old betrothed but despised;
So disguise shall, by the disguised,
Pay with falsehood false exacting,
And perform an old contracting.


MARIANA:
Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
You had not found me here so musical:
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
for me here to-day? much upon this time have
I promised here to meet.

MARIANA:
You have not been inquired after:
I have sat here all day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may
be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.

MARIANA:
I am always bound to you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Very well met, and well come.
What is the news from this good deputy?

ISABELLA:
He hath a garden circummured with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
That makes his opening with this bigger key:
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA:
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
In action all of precept, he did show me
The way twice o'er.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are there no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISABELLA:
No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
I come about my brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis well borne up.
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
She comes to do you good.

ISABELLA:
I do desire the like.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

MARIANA:
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
The vaporous night approaches.

MARIANA:
Will't please you walk aside?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quests
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fancies.
Welcome, how agreed?

ISABELLA:
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not my consent,
But my entreaty too.

ISABELLA:
Little have you to say
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother.'

MARIANA:
Fear me not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husband on a pre-contract:
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

Provost:
Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?

POMPEY:
If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
cut off a woman's head.

Provost:
Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
notorious bawd.

POMPEY:
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
would be glad to receive some instruction from my
fellow partner.

Provost:
What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?

ABHORSON:
Do you call, sir?

Provost:
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.

ABHORSON:
A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.

Provost:
Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
the scale.

POMPEY:
Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?

ABHORSON:
Ay, sir; a mystery

POMPEY:
Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
should be hanged, I cannot imagine.

ABHORSON:
Sir, it is a mystery.

POMPEY:
Proof?

ABHORSON:
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
apparel fits your thief.

Provost:
Are you agreed?

POMPEY:
Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
oftener ask forgiveness.

Provost:
You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
to-morrow four o'clock.

ABHORSON:
Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.

POMPEY:
I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
a good turn.

Provost:
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:
The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?

CLAUDIO:
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
He will not wake.

Provost:
Who can do good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself.
But, hark, what noise?
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
By and by.
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudio.
Welcome father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

Provost:
None, since the curfew rung.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not Isabel?

Provost:
No.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
They will, then, ere't be long.

Provost:
What comfort is for Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There's some in hope.

Provost:
It is a bitter deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just.
Now are they come.
This is a gentle provost: seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.

Provost:
There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
But he must die to-morrow?

Provost:
None, sir, none.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.

Provost:
Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we:
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.
This is his lordship's man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And here comes Claudio's pardon.

Messenger:

Provost:
I shall obey him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost:
I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Pray you, let's hear.

Provost:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
afternoon?

Provost:
A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
that is a prisoner nine years old.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How came it that the absent duke had not either
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
have heard it was ever his manner to do so.

Provost:
His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is now apparent?

Provost:
Most manifest, and not denied by himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
seems he to be touched?

Provost:
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
mortality, and desperately mortal.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He wants advice.

Provost:
He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
for the which you are to do me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy.

Provost:
Pray, sir, in what?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
In the delaying death.

Provost:
A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.

Provost:
Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
death: you know the course is common. If any thing
fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
against it with my life.

Provost:
Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?

Provost:
To him, and to his substitutes.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
avouch the justice of your dealing?

Provost:
But what likelihood is in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
signet is not strange to you.

Provost:
I know them both.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
shall find, within these two days he will be here.
This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
very day receives letters of strange tenor;
perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
things should be: all difficulties are but easy
when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

POMPEY:
I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
of profession: one would think it were Mistress
Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not
much in request, for the old women were all dead.
Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of
Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in
our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'

ABHORSON:
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

POMPEY:
Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
Master Barnardine!

ABHORSON:
What, ho, Barnardine!

BARNARDINE:

POMPEY:
Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
good, sir, to rise and be put to death.

BARNARDINE:

ABHORSON:
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

POMPEY:
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
executed, and sleep afterwards.

ABHORSON:
Go in to him, and fetch him out.

POMPEY:
He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.

ABHORSON:
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

POMPEY:
Very ready, sir.

BARNARDINE:
How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?

ABHORSON:
Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.

BARNARDINE:
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for 't.

POMPEY:
O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
sounder all the next day.

ABHORSON:
Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
we jest now, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
you and pray with you.

BARNARDINE:
Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,
and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
consent to die this day, that's certain.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go.

BARNARDINE:
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
persuasion.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But hear you.

BARNARDINE:
Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

Provost:
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

Provost:
Here in the prison, father,
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
And sent according to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

Provost:
This shall be done, good father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
And how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let this be done.
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your safety manifested.

Provost:
I am your free dependant.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall proceed with Angelo.

Provost:
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.

Provost:
I'll make all speed.

ISABELLA:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
When it is least expected.

ISABELLA:
Ho, by your leave!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

ISABELLA:
The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
His head is off and sent to Angelo.

ISABELLA:
Nay, but it is not so.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
In your close patience.

ISABELLA:
O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall not be admitted to his sight.

ISABELLA:
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity:
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
One of our convent, and his confessor,
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go,
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
And general honour.

ISABELLA:
I am directed by you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
Say, by this token, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your course. Who's here?

LUCIO:
Good even. Friar, where's the provost?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not within, sir.

LUCIO:
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
at home, he had lived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO:
Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.

LUCIO:
Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
they be true; if not true, none were enough.

LUCIO:
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you such a thing?

LUCIO:
Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

LUCIO:
By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.

ESCALUS:
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.

ANGELO:
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
redeliver our authorities there

ESCALUS:
I guess not.

ANGELO:
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
they should exhibit their petitions in the street?

ESCALUS:
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
complaints, and to deliver us from devices
hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
against us.

ANGELO:
Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
him.

ESCALUS:
I shall, sir. Fare you well.

ANGELO:
Good night.
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
And by an eminent body that enforced
The law against it! But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
These letters at fit time deliver me
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.

FRIAR PETER:
It shall be speeded well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.

ISABELLA:
To speak so indirectly I am loath:
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

MARIANA:
Be ruled by him.

ISABELLA:
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.

MARIANA:
I would Friar Peter--

ISABELLA:
O, peace! the friar is come.

FRIAR PETER:
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

ANGELO:
Happy return be to your royal grace!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.

ANGELO:
You make my bonds still greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And let the subject see, to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our other hand;
And good supporters are you.

FRIAR PETER:
Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.

ISABELLA:
Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
Reveal yourself to him.

ISABELLA:
O worthy duke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
Must either punish me, not being believed,
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!

ANGELO:
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
Cut off by course of justice,--

ISABELLA:
By course of justice!

ANGELO:
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

ISABELLA:
Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
Is it not strange and strange?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, it is ten times strange.

ISABELLA:
It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange:
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of reckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with her! Poor soul,
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

ISABELLA:
O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
There is another comfort than this world,
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Had I more name for badness.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By mine honesty,
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.

ISABELLA:
O gracious duke,
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

ISABELLA:
I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger,--

LUCIO:
That's I, an't like your grace:
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.

ISABELLA:
That's he indeed.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You were not bid to speak.

LUCIO:
No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

LUCIO:
I warrant your honour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.

ISABELLA:
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--

LUCIO:
Right.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.

ISABELLA:
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That's somewhat madly spoken.

ISABELLA:
Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Mended again. The matter; proceed.

ISABELLA:
In brief, to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poor brother's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is most likely!

ISABELLA:
O, that it were as like as it is true!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practise. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou camest here to complain.

ISABELLA:
And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?

ISABELLA:
One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

LUCIO:
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
For certain words he spake against your grace
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

LUCIO:
But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow.

FRIAR PETER:
Blessed be your royal grace!
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she from one ungot.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

FRIAR PETER:
I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
As he's reported by this gentleman;
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.

LUCIO:
My lord, most villanously; believe it.

FRIAR PETER:
Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
But at this instant he is sick my lord,
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
Is true and false; and what he with his oath
And all probation will make up full clear,
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
To justify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and personally accused,
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good friar, let's hear it.
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
First, let her show her face, and after speak.

MARIANA:
Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
Until my husband bid me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, are you married?

MARIANA:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are you a maid?

MARIANA:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A widow, then?

MARIANA:
Neither, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?

LUCIO:
My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
neither maid, widow, nor wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself.

LUCIO:
Well, my lord.

MARIANA:
My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
And I confess besides I am no maid:
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.

LUCIO:
He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!

LUCIO:
Well, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

MARIANA:
Now I come to't my lord
She that accuses him of fornication,
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
And charges him my lord, with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
With all the effect of love.

ANGELO:
Charges she more than me?

MARIANA:
Not that I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say your husband.

MARIANA:
Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

ANGELO:
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

MARIANA:
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
In her imagined person.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Know you this woman?

LUCIO:
Carnally, she says.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, no more!

LUCIO:
Enough, my lord.

ANGELO:
My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition, but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time of five years
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.

MARIANA:
Noble prince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees
Or else for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!

ANGELO:
I did but smile till now:
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
To find this practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, with my heart
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.

FRIAR PETER:
Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint:
Your provost knows the place where he abides
And he may fetch him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go do it instantly.
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
But stir not you till you have well determined
Upon these slanderers.

ESCALUS:
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

LUCIO:
'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the duke.

ESCALUS:
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
notable fellow.

LUCIO:
As any in Vienna, on my word.

ESCALUS:
Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
shall see how I'll handle her.

LUCIO:
Not better than he, by her own report.

ESCALUS:
Say you?

LUCIO:
Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
she'll be ashamed.

ESCALUS:
I will go darkly to work with her.

LUCIO:
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.

ESCALUS:
Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
that you have said.

LUCIO:
My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
the provost.

ESCALUS:
In very good time: speak not you to him till we
call upon you.

LUCIO:
Mum.

ESCALUS:
Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis false.

ESCALUS:
How! know you where you are?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.

ESCALUS:
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.

LUCIO:
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

ESCALUS:
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
What 'unjust'!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.

ESCALUS:
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!

ANGELO:
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?

LUCIO:
'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
do you know me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.

LUCIO:
O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Most notedly, sir.

LUCIO:
Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
much more, much worse.

LUCIO:
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.

ANGELO:
Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
treasonable abuses!

ESCALUS:
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
with the other confederate companion!

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

LUCIO:
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
Will't not off?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

LUCIO:
This may prove worse than hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
O my dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own confession:
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Is all the grace I beg.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

ANGELO:
I was, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.

ESCALUS:
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the strangeness of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Isabel.
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
Advertising and holy to your business,
Not changing heart with habit, I am still
Attorney'd at your service.

ISABELLA:
O, give me pardon,
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereignty!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pardon'd, Isabel:
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
So happy is your brother.

ISABELLA:
I do, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For this new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your well defended honour, you must pardon
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Away with him!

MARIANA:
O my most gracious lord,
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life
And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal,
To buy you a better husband.

MARIANA:
O my dear lord,
I crave no other, nor no better man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Never crave him; we are definitive.

MARIANA:
Gentle my liege,--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death!
Now, sir, to you.

MARIANA:
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Against all sense you do importune her:
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.

MARIANA:
Isabel,
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
And, for the most, become much more the better
For being a little bad: so may my husband.
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He dies for Claudio's death.

ISABELLA:
Most bounteous sir,
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my brother lived: I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
Till he did look on me: since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did the thing for which he died:
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And must be buried but as an intent
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely thoughts.

MARIANA:
Merely, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

Provost:
It was commanded so.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Had you a special warrant for the deed?

Provost:
No, my good lord; it was by private message.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which I do discharge you of your office:
Give up your keys.

Provost:
Pardon me, noble lord:
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice;
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserved alive.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's he?

Provost:
His name is Barnardine.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

ESCALUS:
I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

ANGELO:
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which is that Barnardine?

Provost:
This, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?

Provost:
This is another prisoner that I saved.
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Claudio as himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

LUCIO:
'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
had rather it would please you I might be whipt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

LUCIO:
I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed.

LUCIO:
Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
whipping, and hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Slandering a prince deserves it.
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
I have a motion much imports your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.

SLY:
I'll pheeze you, in faith.

Hostess:
A pair of stocks, you rogue!

SLY:
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!

Hostess:
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?

SLY:
No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
bed, and warm thee.

Hostess:
I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
third--borough.

SLY:
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
and kindly.

Lord:
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.

First Huntsman:
Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
He cried upon it at the merest loss
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.

Lord:
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well and look unto them all:
To-morrow I intend to hunt again.

First Huntsman:
I will, my lord.

Lord:
What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?

Second Huntsman:
He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.

Lord:
O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
Would not the beggar then forget himself?

First Huntsman:
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.

Second Huntsman:
It would seem strange unto him when he waked.

Lord:
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Then take him up and manage well the jest:
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
Procure me music ready when he wakes,
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
And with a low submissive reverence
Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
Some one be ready with a costly suit
And ask him what apparel he will wear;
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
And that his lady mourns at his disease:
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
It will be pastime passing excellent,
If it be husbanded with modesty.

First Huntsman:
My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
As he shall think by our true diligence
He is no less than what we say he is.

Lord:
Take him up gently and to bed with him;
And each one to his office when he wakes.
Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
How now! who is it?

Servant:
An't please your honour, players
That offer service to your lordship.

Lord:
Bid them come near.
Now, fellows, you are welcome.

Players:
We thank your honour.

Lord:
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?

A Player:
So please your lordship to accept our duty.

Lord:
With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.

A Player:
I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.

Lord:
'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
The rather for I have some sport in hand
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
But I am doubtful of your modesties;
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
For yet his honour never heard a play--
You break into some merry passion
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
If you should smile he grows impatient.

A Player:
Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
Were he the veriest antic in the world.

Lord:
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
And give them friendly welcome every one:
Let them want nothing that my house affords.
Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
He bear himself with honourable action,
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And say 'What is't your honour will command,
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
May show her duty and make known her love?'
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
And with declining head into his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
To see her noble lord restored to health,
Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
And if the boy have not a woman's gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears,
An onion will do well for such a shift,
Which in a napkin being close convey'd
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
May well abate the over-merry spleen
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

SLY:
For God's sake, a pot of small ale.

First Servant:
Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?

Second Servant:
Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?

Third Servant:
What raiment will your honour wear to-day?

SLY:
I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if
you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I
have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,
sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
toes look through the over-leather.

Lord:
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
O, that a mighty man of such descent,
Of such possessions and so high esteem,
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!

SLY:
What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher
Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a
pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a
bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?
Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if
she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence
on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the
lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not
bestraught: here's--

Third Servant:
O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!

Second Servant:
O, this is it that makes your servants droop!

Lord:
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.

First Servant:
Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.

Second Servant:
Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
Adonis painted by a running brook,
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.

Lord:
We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
And how she was beguiled and surprised,
As lively painted as the deed was done.

Third Servant:
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.

Lord:
Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this waning age.

First Servant:
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
She was the fairest creature in the world;
And yet she is inferior to none.

SLY:
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.

Second Servant:
Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
O, that once more you knew but what you are!
These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.

SLY:
These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
But did I never speak of all that time?

First Servant:
O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
And rail upon the hostess of the house;
And say you would present her at the leet,
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.

SLY:
Ay, the woman's maid of the house.

Third Servant:
Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And twenty more such names and men as these
Which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!

ALL:
Amen.

SLY:
I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.

Page:
How fares my noble lord?

SLY:
Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.
Where is my wife?

Page:
Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?

SLY:
Are you my wife and will not call me husband?
My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.

Page:
My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
I am your wife in all obedience.

SLY:
I know it well. What must I call her?

Lord:
Madam.

SLY:
Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?

Lord:
'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords
call ladies.

SLY:
Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
And slept above some fifteen year or more.

Page:
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.

SLY:
'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
Madam, undress you and come now to bed.

Page:
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
To pardon me yet for a night or two,
Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
For your physicians have expressly charged,
In peril to incur your former malady,
That I should yet absent me from your bed:
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.

SLY:
Ay, it stands so that I may hardly
tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in
despite of the flesh and the blood.

Messenger:
Your honour's players, heating your amendment,
Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
For so your doctors hold it very meet,
Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.

SLY:
Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?

Page:
No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.

SLY:
What, household stuff?

Page:
It is a kind of history.

SLY:
Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side
and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy;
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
With his good will and thy good company,
My trusty servant, well approved in all,
Here let us breathe and haply institute
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
Gave me my being and my father first,
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness
By virtue specially to be achieved.
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

TRANIO:
Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad that you thus continue your resolve
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline,
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken you;
The mathematics and the metaphysics,
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
We could at once put us in readiness,
And take a lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay a while: what company is this?

TRANIO:
Master, some show to welcome us to town.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolved you know;
That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder:
If either of you both love Katharina,
Because I know you well and love you well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.

GREMIO:

KATHARINA:
I pray you, sir, is it your will
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?

HORTENSIO:
Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.

KATHARINA:
I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
I wis it is not half way to her heart;
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and use you like a fool.

HORTENSIA:
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!

GREMIO:
And me too, good Lord!

TRANIO:
Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

LUCENTIO:
But in the other's silence do I see
Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.
Peace, Tranio!

TRANIO:
Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
What I have said, Bianca, get you in:
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.

KATHARINA:
A pretty peat! it is best
Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.

BIANCA:
Sister, content you in my discontent.
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
My books and instruments shall be my company,
On them to took and practise by myself.

LUCENTIO:
Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.

HORTENSIO:
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our good will effects
Bianca's grief.

GREMIO:
Why will you mew her up,
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
And make her bear the penance of her tongue?

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:
Go in, Bianca:
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments and poetry,
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
I will be very kind, and liberal
To mine own children in good bringing up:
And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
For I have more to commune with Bianca.

KATHARINA:
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I
knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?

GREMIO:
You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not
so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
wish him to her father.

HORTENSIO:
So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,
that we may yet again have access to our fair
mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
labour and effect one thing specially.

GREMIO:
What's that, I pray?

HORTENSIO:
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.

GREMIO:
A husband! a devil.

HORTENSIO:
I say, a husband.

GREMIO:
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though
her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool
to be married to hell?

HORTENSIO:
Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine
to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,
would take her with all faults, and money enough.

GREMIO:
I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
this condition, to be whipped at the high cross
every morning.

HORTENSIO:
Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
friends, it shall be so far forth friendly
maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
How say you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
I am agreed; and would I had given him the best
horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the
house of her! Come on.

TRANIO:
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
That love should of a sudden take such hold?

LUCENTIO:
O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
I never thought it possible or likely;
But see, while idly I stood looking on,
I found the effect of love in idleness:
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
That art to me as secret and as dear
As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
If I achieve not this young modest girl.
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.

TRANIO:
Master, it is no time to chide you now;
Affection is not rated from the heart:
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.

TRANIO:
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.

LUCENTIO:
O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

TRANIO:
Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
And with her breath she did perfume the air:
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.

TRANIO:
Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
That till the father rid his hands of her,
Master, your love must live a maid at home;
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.

LUCENTIO:
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
But art thou not advised, he took some care
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?

TRANIO:
Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.

LUCENTIO:
I have it, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Master, for my hand,
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.

LUCENTIO:
Tell me thine first.

TRANIO:
You will be schoolmaster
And undertake the teaching of the maid:
That's your device.

LUCENTIO:
It is: may it be done?

TRANIO:
Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
Visit his countrymen and banquet them?

LUCENTIO:
Basta; content thee, for I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any house,
Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
For man or master; then it follows thus;
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Keep house and port and servants as I should:
I will some other be, some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.

TRANIO:
So had you need.
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
And I am tied to be obedient;
For so your father charged me at our parting,
'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
Although I think 'twas in another sense;
I am content to be Lucentio,
Because so well I love Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:
And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Here comes the rogue.
Sirrah, where have you been?

BIONDELLO:
Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?

LUCENTIO:
Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
And I for my escape have put on his;
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
While I make way from hence to save my life:
You understand me?

BIONDELLO:
I, sir! ne'er a whit.

LUCENTIO:
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.

BIONDELLO:
The better for him: would I were so too!

TRANIO:
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
But in all places else your master Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that
thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if
thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good
and weighty.

First Servant:
My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.

SLY:
Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:
comes there any more of it?

Page:
My lord, 'tis but begun.

SLY:
'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:
would 'twere done!

PETRUCHIO:
Verona, for a while I take my leave,
To see my friends in Padua, but of all
My best beloved and approved friend,
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.

GRUMIO:
Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
rebused your worship?

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.

GRUMIO:
Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
I should knock you here, sir?

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.

GRUMIO:
My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
you first,
And then I know after who comes by the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
Will it not be?
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

GRUMIO:
Help, masters, help! my master is mad.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!

HORTENSIO:
How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.

HORTENSIO:
'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
this quarrel.

GRUMIO:
Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
And could not get him for my heart to do it.

GRUMIO:
Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
now with, 'knocking at the gate'?

PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
To seek their fortunes farther than at home
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Antonio, my father, is deceased;
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
And so am come abroad to see the world.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to her.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

GRUMIO:
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases
as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
so money comes withal.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
Is that she is intolerable curst
And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
That, were my state far worser than it is,
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
For I will board her, though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.

HORTENSIO:
Her father is Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous gentleman:
Her name is Katharina Minola,
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
I know her father, though I know not her;
And he knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
To give you over at this first encounter,
Unless you will accompany me thither.

GRUMIO:
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
would think scolding would do little good upon him:
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in
his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
her face and so disfigure her with it that she
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
You know him not, sir.

HORTENSIO:
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
And her withholds from me and other more,
Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
Supposing it a thing impossible,
For those defects I have before rehearsed,
That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
That none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.

GRUMIO:
Katharina the curst!
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.

HORTENSIO:
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
And offer me disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
That so I may, by this device, at least
Have leave and leisure to make love to her
And unsuspected court her by herself.

GRUMIO:
Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,
how the young folks lay their heads together!
Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?

HORTENSIO:
Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
Petruchio, stand by a while.

GRUMIO:
A proper stripling and an amorous!

GREMIO:
O, very well; I have perused the note.
Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:
All books of love, see that at any hand;
And see you read no other lectures to her:
You understand me: over and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality,
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
And let me have them very well perfumed
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?

LUCENTIO:
Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
As for my patron, stand you so assured,
As firmly as yourself were still in place:
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.

GREMIO:
O this learning, what a thing it is!

GRUMIO:
O this woodcock, what an ass it is!

PETRUCHIO:
Peace, sirrah!

HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.

GREMIO:
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
I promised to inquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man, for learning and behavior
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.

HORTENSIO:
'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
Hath promised me to help me to another,
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.

GREMIO:
Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.

GRUMIO:
And that his bags shall prove.

HORTENSIO:
Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
Upon agreement from us to his liking,
Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.

GREMIO:
So said, so done, is well.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

PETRUCHIO:
I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.

GREMIO:
No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?

PETRUCHIO:
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
And I do hope good days and long to see.

GREMIO:
O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
You shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wild-cat?

PETRUCHIO:
Will I live?

GRUMIO:
Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.

PETRUCHIO:
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.

GRUMIO:
For he fears none.

GREMIO:
Hortensio, hark:
This gentleman is happily arrived,
My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.

HORTENSIO:
I promised we would be contributors
And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.

GREMIO:
And so we will, provided that he win her.

GRUMIO:
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.

TRANIO:
Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?

BIONDELLO:
He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?

TRANIO:
Even he, Biondello.

GREMIO:
Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--

TRANIO:
Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?

PETRUCHIO:
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.

TRANIO:
I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.

LUCENTIO:
Well begun, Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, a word ere you go;
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?

TRANIO:
And if I be, sir, is it any offence?

GREMIO:
No; if without more words you will get you hence.

TRANIO:
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
For me as for you?

GREMIO:
But so is not she.

TRANIO:
For what reason, I beseech you?

GREMIO:
For this reason, if you'll know,
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.

HORTENSIO:
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
Do me this right; hear me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
To whom my father is not all unknown;
And were his daughter fairer than she is,
She may more suitors have and me for one.
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

GREMIO:
What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.

LUCENTIO:
Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?

HORTENSIO:
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?

TRANIO:
No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.

GREMIO:
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
The youngest daughter whom you hearken for
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
And will not promise her to any man
Until the elder sister first be wed:
The younger then is free and not before.

TRANIO:
If it be so, sir, that you are the man
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
And if you break the ice and do this feat,
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
To whom we all rest generally beholding.

TRANIO:
Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
And do as adversaries do in law,
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

GRUMIO:
O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.

HORTENSIO:
The motion's good indeed and be it so,
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.

BIANCA:
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will command me will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.

KATHARINA:
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.

BIANCA:
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.

KATHARINA:
Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?

BIANCA:
If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
him.

KATHARINA:
O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.

BIANCA:
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
You have but jested with me all this while:
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.

KATHARINA:
If that be jest, then all the rest was so.

BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

KATHARINA:
Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.

BAPTISTA:
What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.

KATHARINA:
What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.

BAPTISTA:
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
But who comes here?

GREMIO:
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.

BAPTISTA:
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
God save you, gentlemen!

PETRUCHIO:
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?

BAPTISTA:
I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.

GREMIO:
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.

PETRUCHIO:
You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Her affability and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
I do present you with a man of mine,
Cunning in music and the mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.

BAPTISTA:
You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.

PETRUCHIO:
I see you do not mean to part with her,
Or else you like not of my company.

BAPTISTA:
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?

PETRUCHIO:
Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
A man well known throughout all Italy.

BAPTISTA:
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.

GREMIO:
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.

GREMIO:
I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
that have been more kindly beholding to you than
any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning
in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
accept his service.

BAPTISTA:
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
Welcome, good Cambio.
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?

TRANIO:
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
That, being a stranger in this city here,
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This liberty is all that I request,
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
And free access and favour as the rest:
And, toward the education of your daughters,
I here bestow a simple instrument,
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then their worth is great.

BAPTISTA:
Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?

TRANIO:
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.

BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of Pisa; by report
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
To my daughters; and tell them both,
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
We will go walk a little in the orchard,
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
And every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew my father well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?

BAPTISTA:
After my death the one half of my lands,
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.

PETRUCHIO:
And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
That covenants may be kept on either hand.

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
And where two raging fires meet together
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
So I to her and so she yields to me;
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.

BAPTISTA:
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
That shake not, though they blow perpetually.

BAPTISTA:
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?

HORTENSIO:
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

BAPTISTA:
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

HORTENSIO:
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.

BAPTISTA:
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?

HORTENSIO:
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
with them:'
And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
And through the instrument my pate made way;
And there I stood amazed for a while,
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
While she did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
As had she studied to misuse me so.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
O, how I long to have some chat with her!

BAPTISTA:
Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?

PETRUCHIO:
I pray you do.
I will attend her here,
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
Then I'll commend her volubility,
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
As though she bid me stay by her a week:
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.

KATHARINA:
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
They call me Katharina that do talk of me.

PETRUCHIO:
You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.

KATHARINA:
Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
You were a moveable.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, what's a moveable?

KATHARINA:
A join'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.

KATHARINA:
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to bear, and so are you.

KATHARINA:
No such jade as you, if me you mean.

PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be but young and light--

KATHARINA:
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should--buzz!

KATHARINA:
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?

KATHARINA:
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.

KATHARINA:
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO:
My remedy is then, to pluck it out.

KATHARINA:
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,

PETRUCHIO:
Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.

KATHARINA:
In his tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
Whose tongue?

KATHARINA:
Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.

PETRUCHIO:
What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.

KATHARINA:
That I'll try.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.

KATHARINA:
So may you lose your arms:
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.

PETRUCHIO:
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!

KATHARINA:
What is your crest? a coxcomb?

PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

KATHARINA:
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.

KATHARINA:
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.

KATHARINA:
There is, there is.

PETRUCHIO:
Then show it me.

KATHARINA:
Had I a glass, I would.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you mean my face?

KATHARINA:
Well aim'd of such a young one.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.

KATHARINA:
Yet you are wither'd.

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis with cares.

KATHARINA:
I care not.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.

KATHARINA:
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.

PETRUCHIO:
No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar;
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.

KATHARINA:
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.

PETRUCHIO:
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA:
Where did you study all this goodly speech?

PETRUCHIO:
It is extempore, from my mother-wit.

KATHARINA:
A witty mother! witless else her son.

PETRUCHIO:
Am I not wise?

KATHARINA:
Yes; keep you warm.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
Thou must be married to no man but me;
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates.
Here comes your father: never make denial;
I must and will have Katharina to my wife.

BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?

PETRUCHIO:
How but well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss.

BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?

KATHARINA:
Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

KATHARINA:
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

GREMIO:
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
hang'd first.

TRANIO:
Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!

PETRUCHIO:
Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
That she shall still be curst in company.
I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
How tame, when men and women are alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.

BAPTISTA:
I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.

GREMIO:
Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
We will have rings and things and fine array;
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.

GREMIO:
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?

BAPTISTA:
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.

TRANIO:
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

BAPTISTA:
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.

GREMIO:
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
Now is the day we long have looked for:
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.

TRANIO:
And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.

GREMIO:
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.

TRANIO:
Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.

GREMIO:
But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.

TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

BAPTISTA:
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?

GREMIO:
First, as you know, my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
Pewter and brass and all things that belong
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
And all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
If whilst I live she will be only mine.

TRANIO:
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's heir and only son:
If I may have your daughter to my wife,
I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
My land amounts not to so much in all:
That she shall have; besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
What, have I choked you with an argosy?

TRANIO:
Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.

GREMIO:
Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
And she can have no more than all I have:
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.

TRANIO:
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.

BAPTISTA:
I must confess your offer is the best;
And, let your father make her the assurance,
She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
if you should die before him, where's her dower?

TRANIO:
That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

GREMIO:
And may not young men die, as well as old?

BAPTISTA:
Well, gentlemen,
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
My daughter Katharina is to be married:
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
If not, Signior Gremio:
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.

GREMIO:
Adieu, good neighbour.
Now I fear thee not:
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
To give thee all, and in his waning age
Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.

TRANIO:
A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

LUCENTIO:
Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?

HORTENSIO:
But, wrangling pedant, this is
The patroness of heavenly harmony:
Then give me leave to have prerogative;
And when in music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.

LUCENTIO:
Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause, serve in your harmony.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.

BIANCA:
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

HORTENSIO:
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?

LUCENTIO:
That will be never: tune your instrument.

BIANCA:
Where left we last?

LUCENTIO:
Here, madam:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Construe them.

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes
a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'
bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might
beguile the old pantaloon.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, my instrument's in tune.

BIANCA:
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.

LUCENTIO:
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

BIANCA:
Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
despair not.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, 'tis now in tune.

LUCENTIO:
All but the base.

HORTENSIO:
The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.

BIANCA:
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

LUCENTIO:
Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.

BIANCA:
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

HORTENSIO:
You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
My lessons make no music in three parts.

LUCENTIO:
Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, before you touch the instrument,
To learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with rudiments of art;
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.

BIANCA:
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

HORTENSIO:
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.

BIANCA:

Servant:
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.

BIANCA:
Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.

LUCENTIO:
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.

HORTENSIO:
But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.

BAPTISTA:

KATHARINA:
No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
To give my hand opposed against my heart
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
And, to be noted for a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
If it would please him come and marry her!'

TRANIO:
Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.

KATHARINA:
Would Katharina had never seen him though!

BAPTISTA:
Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
For such an injury would vex a very saint,
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.

BIONDELLO:
Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
you never heard of!

BAPTISTA:
Is it new and old too? how may that be?

BIONDELLO:
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?

BAPTISTA:
Is he come?

BIONDELLO:
Why, no, sir.

BAPTISTA:
What then?

BIONDELLO:
He is coming.

BAPTISTA:
When will he be here?

BIONDELLO:
When he stands where I am and sees you there.

TRANIO:
But say, what to thine old news?

BIONDELLO:
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected
with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.

BAPTISTA:
Who comes with him?

BIONDELLO:
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.

TRANIO:
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.

BAPTISTA:
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.

BIONDELLO:
Why, sir, he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
Didst thou not say he comes?

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio came?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, that Petruchio came.

BIONDELLO:
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.

BAPTISTA:
Why, that's all one.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you a penny,
A horse and a man
Is more than one,
And yet not many.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?

BAPTISTA:
You are welcome, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
And yet I come not well.

BAPTISTA:
And yet you halt not.

TRANIO:
Not so well apparell'd
As I wish you were.

PETRUCHIO:
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or unusual prodigy?

BAPTISTA:
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!

TRANIO:
And tells us, what occasion of import
Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?

PETRUCHIO:
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
Though in some part enforced to digress;
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.

TRANIO:
See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.

PETRUCHIO:
Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.

BAPTISTA:
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.

PETRUCHIO:
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
Could I repair what she will wear in me,
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat with you,
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!

TRANIO:
He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
We will persuade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church.

BAPTISTA:
I'll after him, and see the event of this.

TRANIO:
But to her love concerneth us to add
Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
As I before unparted to your worship,
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
And make assurance here in Padua
Of greater sums than I have promised.
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.

LUCENTIO:
Were it not that my fellow-school-master
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.

TRANIO:
That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch our vantage in this business:
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?

GREMIO:
As willingly as e'er I came from school.

TRANIO:
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?

GREMIO:
A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.

TRANIO:
Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.

GREMIO:
Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.

TRANIO:
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.

GREMIO:
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'

TRANIO:
What said the wench when he rose again?

GREMIO:
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
This done, he took the bride about the neck
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo:
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad marriage never was before:
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.

PETRUCHIO:
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
I know you think to dine with me to-day,
And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.

BAPTISTA:
Is't possible you will away to-night?

PETRUCHIO:
I must away to-day, before night come:
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all,
That have beheld me give away myself
To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
Dine with my father, drink a health to me;
For I must hence; and farewell to you all.

TRANIO:
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.

PETRUCHIO:
It may not be.

GREMIO:
Let me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be.

KATHARINA:
Let me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
I am content.

KATHARINA:
Are you content to stay?

PETRUCHIO:
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.

KATHARINA:
Now, if you love me, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Grumio, my horse.

GRUMIO:
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.

KATHARINA:
Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
That take it on you at the first so roundly.

PETRUCHIO:
O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.

KATHARINA:
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.

GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.

KATARINA:
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
I see a woman may be made a fool,
If she had not a spirit to resist.

PETRUCHIO:
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be master of what is mine own:
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
thee, Kate:
I'll buckler thee against a million.

BAPTISTA:
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

GREMIO:
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.

TRANIO:
Of all mad matches never was the like.

LUCENTIO:
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?

BIANCA:
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.

GREMIO:
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.

BAPTISTA:
Neighbours and friends, though bride and
bridegroom wants
For to supply the places at the table,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:
And let Bianca take her sister's room.

TRANIO:
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?

BAPTISTA:
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.

GRUMIO:
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever
man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
considering the weather, a taller man than I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.

CURTIS:
Who is that calls so coldly?

GRUMIO:
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.

CURTIS:
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?

GRUMIO:
O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
on no water.

CURTIS:
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?

GRUMIO:
She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
myself, fellow Curtis.

CURTIS:
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.

GRUMIO:
Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a
fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,
whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon
feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?

CURTIS:
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?

GRUMIO:
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.

CURTIS:
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.

GRUMIO:
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
will thaw.

CURTIS:
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!

GRUMIO:
Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
serving-men in their new fustian, their white
stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
the carpets laid, and every thing in order?

CURTIS:
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO:
First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
mistress fallen out.

CURTIS:
How?

GRUMIO:
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
hangs a tale.

CURTIS:
Let's ha't, good Grumio.

GRUMIO:
Lend thine ear.

CURTIS:
Here.

GRUMIO:
There.

CURTIS:
This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.

GRUMIO:
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--

CURTIS:
Both of one horse?

GRUMIO:
What's that to thee?

CURTIS:
Why, a horse.

GRUMIO:
Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how
miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.

CURTIS:
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.

GRUMIO:
Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their
hands. Are they all ready?

CURTIS:
They are.

GRUMIO:
Call them forth.

CURTIS:
Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
countenance my mistress.

GRUMIO:
Why, she hath a face of her own.

CURTIS:
Who knows not that?

GRUMIO:
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
countenance her.

CURTIS:
I call them forth to credit her.

GRUMIO:
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.

NATHANIEL:
Welcome home, Grumio!

PHILIP:
How now, Grumio!

JOSEPH:
What, Grumio!

NICHOLAS:
Fellow Grumio!

NATHANIEL:
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
companions, is all ready, and all things neat?

NATHANIEL:
All things is ready. How near is our master?

GRUMIO:
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.

PETRUCHIO:
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?

ALL SERVING-MEN:
Here, here, sir; here, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?

GRUMIO:
Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.

PETRUCHIO:
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?

GRUMIO:
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
Where is the life that late I led--
Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
Sound, sound, sound, sound!
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
It was the friar of orders grey,
As he forth walked on his way:--
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?

KATHARINA:
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.

PETRUCHIO:
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
What's this? mutton?

First Servant:
Ay.

PETRUCHIO:
Who brought it?

PETER:
I.

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
And serve it thus to me that love it not?
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.

KATHARINA:
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
The meat was well, if you were so contented.

PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
And, for this night, we'll fast for company:
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.

NATHANIEL:
Peter, didst ever see the like?

PETER:
He kills her in her own humour.

GRUMIO:
Where is he?

CURTIS:
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.

PETRUCHIO:
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to man my haggard,
To make her come and know her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the making of the bed;
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend care of her;
And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

TRANIO:
Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.

LUCENTIO:
Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?

BIANCA:
What, master, read you? first resolve me that.

LUCENTIO:
I read that I profess, the Art to Love.

BIANCA:
And may you prove, sir, master of your art!

LUCENTIO:
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!

HORTENSIO:
Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.

TRANIO:
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
And makes a god of such a cullion:
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO:
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.

TRANIO:
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!

HORTENSIO:
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be married to a wealthy widow,
Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before.

TRANIO:
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.

BIANCA:
Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?

TRANIO:
Mistress, we have.

LUCENTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be wood and wedded in a day.

BIANCA:
God give him joy!

TRANIO:
Ay, and he'll tame her.

BIANCA:
He says so, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.

BIANCA:
The taming-school! what, is there such a place?

TRANIO:
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

BIONDELLO:
O master, master, I have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Will serve the turn.

TRANIO:
What is he, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I know not what; but format in apparel,
In gait and countenance surely like a father.

LUCENTIO:
And what of him, Tranio?

TRANIO:
If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
As if he were the right Vincentio
Take in your love, and then let me alone.

Pedant:
God save you, sir!

TRANIO:
And you, sir! you are welcome.
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?

Pedant:
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.

TRANIO:
What countryman, I pray?

Pedant:
Of Mantua.

TRANIO:
Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of your life?

Pedant:
My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.

TRANIO:
'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.

Pedant:
Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and must here deliver them.

TRANIO:
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I do, and this I will advise you:
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

Pedant:
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.

TRANIO:
Among them know you one Vincentio?

Pedant:
I know him not, but I have heard of him;
A merchant of incomparable wealth.

TRANIO:
He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.

BIONDELLO:

TRANIO:
To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
Look that you take upon you as you should;
You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city:
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.

Pedant:
O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.

TRANIO:
Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand;
my father is here look'd for every day,
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

GRUMIO:
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.

KATHARINA:
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
What, did he marry me to famish me?
Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
Upon entreaty have a present aims;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
And that which spites me more than all these wants,
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.

GRUMIO:
What say you to a neat's foot?

KATHARINA:
'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.

GRUMIO:
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

KATHARINA:
I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.

GRUMIO:
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?

KATHARINA:
A dish that I do love to feed upon.

GRUMIO:
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.

KATHARINA:
Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.

GRUMIO:
Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA:
Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.

GRUMIO:
Why then, the mustard without the beef.

KATHARINA:
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
That triumph thus upon my misery!
Go, get thee gone, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

HORTENSIO:
Mistress, what cheer?

KATHARINA:
Faith, as cold as can be.

PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am
To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this dish.

KATHARINA:
I pray you, let it stand.

PETRUCHIO:
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.

KATHARINA:
I thank you, sir.

HORTENSIO:
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.

PETRUCHIO:

Haberdasher:
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.

KATHARINA:
I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these

PETRUCHIO:
When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
And not till then.

HORTENSIO:

KATHARINA:
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart concealing it will break,
And rather than it shall, I will be free
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.

KATHARINA:
Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
And it I will have, or I will have none.

PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?

HORTENSIO:

Tailor:
You bid me make it orderly and well,
According to the fashion and the time.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Go, hop me over every kennel home,
For you shall hop without my custom, sir:
I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.

KATHARINA:
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.

Tailor:
She says your worship means to make
a puppet of her.

PETRUCHIO:
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
thou thimble,
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.

Tailor:
Your worship is deceived; the gown is made
Just as my master had direction:
Grumio gave order how it should be done.

GRUMIO:
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.

Tailor:
But how did you desire it should be made?

GRUMIO:
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.

Tailor:
But did you not request to have it cut?

GRUMIO:
Thou hast faced many things.

Tailor:
I have.

GRUMIO:
Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto
thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.

Tailor:
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify

PETRUCHIO:
Read it.

GRUMIO:
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom
of brown thread: I said a gown.

PETRUCHIO:
Proceed.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess the cape.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess two sleeves.

Tailor:

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, there's the villany.

GRUMIO:
Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.

Tailor:
This is true that I say: an I had thee
in place where, thou shouldst know it.

GRUMIO:
I am for thee straight: take thou the
bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.

HORTENSIO:
God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

GRUMIO:
You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.

GRUMIO:
Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'
gown for thy master's use!

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?

GRUMIO:
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
O, fie, fie, fie!

PETRUCHIO:

HORTENSIO:
Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:
Take no unkindness of his hasty words:
Away! I say; commend me to thy master.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
Even in these honest mean habiliments:
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
What is the jay more precious than the lark,
Because his fathers are more beautiful?
Or is the adder better than the eel,
Because his painted skin contents the eye?
O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
For this poor furniture and mean array.
if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;
And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well we may come there by dinner-time.

KATHARINA:
I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.

PETRUCHIO:
It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.

HORTENSIO:

TRANIO:
Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?

Pedant:
Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
Signior Baptista may remember me,
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.

TRANIO:
'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.

Pedant:
I warrant you.
But, sir, here comes your boy;
'Twere good he were school'd.

TRANIO:
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.

BIONDELLO:
Tut, fear not me.

TRANIO:
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

BIONDELLO:
I told him that your father was at Venice,
And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.

TRANIO:
Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.
Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
I pray you stand good father to me now,
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

Pedant:
Soft son!
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself:
And, for the good report I hear of you
And for the love he beareth to your daughter
And she to him, to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good father's care,
To have him match'd; and if you please to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
For curious I cannot be with you,
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.

BAPTISTA:
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
That like a father you will deal with him
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
The match is made, and all is done:
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

TRANIO:
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
We be affied and such assurance ta'en
As shall with either part's agreement stand?

BAPTISTA:
Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
And happily we might be interrupted.

TRANIO:
Then at my lodging, an it like you:
There doth my father lie; and there, this night,
We'll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here:
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

BAPTISTA:
It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.

BIONDELLO:
I pray the gods she may with all my heart!

TRANIO:
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:
Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.

BAPTISTA:
I follow you.

BIONDELLO:
Cambio!

LUCENTIO:
What sayest thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?

LUCENTIO:
Biondello, what of that?

BIONDELLO:
Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to
expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.

LUCENTIO:
I pray thee, moralize them.

BIONDELLO:
Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
deceiving father of a deceitful son.

LUCENTIO:
And what of him?

BIONDELLO:
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.

LUCENTIO:
And then?

BIONDELLO:
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
command at all hours.

LUCENTIO:
And what of all this?

BIONDELLO:
I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
ever and a day.

LUCENTIO:
Hearest thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
you come with your appendix.

LUCENTIO:
I may, and will, if she be so contented:
She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!

KATHARINA:
The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.

KATHARINA:
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!

HORTENSIO:
Say as he says, or we shall never go.

KATHARINA:
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon.

KATHARINA:
I know it is the moon.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.

KATHARINA:
Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
And the moon changes even as your mind.
What you will have it named, even that it is;
And so it shall be so for Katharina.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
And not unluckily against the bias.
But, soft! company is coming here.
Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.

HORTENSIO:
A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.

KATHARINA:
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
Whither away, or where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair a child;
Happier the man, whom favourable stars
Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!

PETRUCHIO:
Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.

KATHARINA:
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green:
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.

PETRUCHIO:
Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
We shall be joyful of thy company.

VINCENTIO:
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.

PETRUCHIO:
What is his name?

VINCENTIO:
Lucentio, gentle sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

VINCENTIO:
But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake?

HORTENSIO:
I do assure thee, father, so it is.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.

HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.

BIONDELLO:
Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.

LUCENTIO:
I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
at home; therefore leave us.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
then come back to my master's as soon as I can.

GREMIO:
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
My father's bears more toward the market-place;
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.

VINCENTIO:
You shall not choose but drink before you go:
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.

GREMIO:
They're busy within; you were best knock louder.

Pedant:
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?

VINCENTIO:
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?

Pedant:
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.

VINCENTIO:
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
make merry withal?

Pedant:
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
need none, so long as I live.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.

Pedant:
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
looking out at the window.

VINCENTIO:
Art thou his father?

Pedant:
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.

PETRUCHIO:

Pedant:
Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.

BIONDELLO:
I have seen them in the church together: God send
'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.

VINCENTIO:

BIONDELLO:
Hope I may choose, sir.

VINCENTIO:
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?

BIONDELLO:
Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
never saw you before in all my life.

VINCENTIO:
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
thy master's father, Vincentio?

BIONDELLO:
What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
see where he looks out of the window.

VINCENTIO:
Is't so, indeed.

BIONDELLO:
Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.

Pedant:
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!

PETRUCHIO:
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
this controversy.

TRANIO:
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?

VINCENTIO:
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
the university.

TRANIO:
How now! what's the matter?

BAPTISTA:
What, is the man lunatic?

TRANIO:
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.

VINCENTIO:
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

BAPTISTA:
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
you think is his name?

VINCENTIO:
His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
him up ever since he was three years old, and his
name is Tranio.

Pedant:
Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.

VINCENTIO:
Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?

TRANIO:
Call forth an officer.
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
I charge you see that he be forthcoming.

VINCENTIO:
Carry me to the gaol!

GREMIO:
Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.

BAPTISTA:
Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.

GREMIO:
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
is the right Vincentio.

Pedant:
Swear, if thou darest.

GREMIO:
Nay, I dare not swear it.

TRANIO:
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.

GREMIO:
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.

BAPTISTA:
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!

VINCENTIO:
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
monstrous villain!

BIONDELLO:
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
forswear him, or else we are all undone.

LUCENTIO:

VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet son?

BIANCA:
Pardon, dear father.

BAPTISTA:
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?

LUCENTIO:
Here's Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio;
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.

GREMIO:
Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!

VINCENTIO:
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so?

BAPTISTA:
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?

BIANCA:
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

VINCENTIO:
I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
me to the gaol.

BAPTISTA:
But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
without asking my good will?

VINCENTIO:
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.

BAPTISTA:
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.

LUCENTIO:
Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.

GREMIO:
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.

KATHARINA:
Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.

PETRUCHIO:
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

KATHARINA:
What, in the midst of the street?

PETRUCHIO:
What, art thou ashamed of me?

KATHARINA:
No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.

KATHARINA:
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late.

LUCENTIO:
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
And time it is, when raging war is done,
To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.

PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!

BAPTISTA:
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.

PETRUCHIO:
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.

HORTENSIO:
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.

Widow:
Then never trust me, if I be afeard.

PETRUCHIO:
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.

Widow:
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.

PETRUCHIO:
Roundly replied.

KATHARINA:
Mistress, how mean you that?

Widow:
Thus I conceive by him.

PETRUCHIO:
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?

HORTENSIO:
My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.

PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

KATHARINA:
'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.

Widow:
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
And now you know my meaning,

KATHARINA:
A very mean meaning.

Widow:
Right, I mean you.

KATHARINA:
And I am mean indeed, respecting you.

PETRUCHIO:
To her, Kate!

HORTENSIO:
To her, widow!

PETRUCHIO:
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.

HORTENSIO:
That's my office.

PETRUCHIO:
Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!

BAPTISTA:
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?

GREMIO:
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.

BIANCA:
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.

VINCENTIO:
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?

BIANCA:
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,
Have at you for a bitter jest or two!

BIANCA:
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.

PETRUCHIO:
She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.

TRANIO:
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
Which runs himself and catches for his master.

PETRUCHIO:
A good swift simile, but something currish.

TRANIO:
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.

BAPTISTA:
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

LUCENTIO:
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?

PETRUCHIO:
A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.

BAPTISTA:
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
Let's each one send unto his wife;
And he whose wife is most obedient
To come at first when he doth send for her,
Shall win the wager which we will propose.

HORTENSIO:
Content. What is the wager?

LUCENTIO:
Twenty crowns.

PETRUCHIO:
Twenty crowns!
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
But twenty times so much upon my wife.

LUCENTIO:
A hundred then.

HORTENSIO:
Content.

PETRUCHIO:
A match! 'tis done.

HORTENSIO:
Who shall begin?

LUCENTIO:
That will I.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.

BIONDELLO:
I go.

BAPTISTA:
Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.

LUCENTIO:
I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
How now! what news?

BIONDELLO:
Sir, my mistress sends you word
That she is busy and she cannot come.

PETRUCHIO:
How! she is busy and she cannot come!
Is that an answer?

GREMIO:
Ay, and a kind one too:
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.

PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith.

PETRUCHIO:
O, ho! entreat her!
Nay, then she must needs come.

HORTENSIO:
I am afraid, sir,
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
Now, where's my wife?

BIONDELLO:
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
She will not come: she bids you come to her.

PETRUCHIO:
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
Intolerable, not to be endured!
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
Say, I command her to come to me.

HORTENSIO:
I know her answer.

PETRUCHIO:
What?

HORTENSIO:
She will not.

PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.

BAPTISTA:
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!

KATHARINA:
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?

PETRUCHIO:
Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?

KATHARINA:
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.

PETRUCHIO:
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.

LUCENTIO:
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.

HORTENSIO:
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
And awful rule and right supremacy;
And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?

BAPTISTA:
Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another daughter,
For she is changed, as she had never been.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I will win my wager better yet
And show more sign of her obedience,
Her new-built virtue and obedience.
See where she comes and brings your froward wives
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.

Widow:
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!

BIANCA:
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?

LUCENTIO:
I would your duty were as foolish too:
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.

BIANCA:
The more fool you, for laying on my duty.

PETRUCHIO:
Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.

Widow:
Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, I say; and first begin with her.

Widow:
She shall not.

PETRUCHIO:
I say she shall: and first begin with her.

KATHARINA:
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land,
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks and true obedience;
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
I am ashamed that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
And place your hands below your husband's foot:
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.

LUCENTIO:
Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.

VINCENTIO:
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.

LUCENTIO:
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
We three are married, but you two are sped.
'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
And, being a winner, God give you good night!

HORTENSIO:
Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.

LUCENTIO:
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.

Master:
Boatswain!

Boatswain:
Here, master: what cheer?

Master:
Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.

Boatswain:
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
if room enough!

ALONSO:
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
Play the men.

Boatswain:
I pray now, keep below.

ANTONIO:
Where is the master, boatswain?

Boatswain:
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
cabins: you do assist the storm.

GONZALO:
Nay, good, be patient.

Boatswain:
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.

GONZALO:
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

Boatswain:
None that I more love than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our way, I say.

GONZALO:
I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.

Boatswain:
Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
her to try with main-course.
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
the weather or our office.
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?

SEBASTIAN:
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!

Boatswain:
Work you then.

ANTONIO:
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.

GONZALO:
I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.

Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.

Mariners:
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
For our case is as theirs.

SEBASTIAN:
I'm out of patience.

ANTONIO:
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!

GONZALO:
He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it
And gape at widest to glut him.

ANTONIO:
Let's all sink with the king.

SEBASTIAN:
Let's take leave of him.

GONZALO:
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
die a dry death.

MIRANDA:
If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.

PROSPERO:
Be collected:
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
There's no harm done.

MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!

PROSPERO:
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
And thy no greater father.

MIRANDA:
More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.

PROSPERO:
'Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no soul--
No, not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
For thou must now know farther.

MIRANDA:
You have often
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

PROSPERO:
The hour's now come;
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
Out three years old.

MIRANDA:
Certainly, sir, I can.

PROSPERO:
By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance.

MIRANDA:
'Tis far off
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?

PROSPERO:
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
How thou camest here thou mayst.

MIRANDA:
But that I do not.

PROSPERO:
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
Sir, are not you my father?

PROSPERO:
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
And princess no worse issued.

MIRANDA:
O the heavens!
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO:
Both, both, my girl:
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
But blessedly holp hither.

MIRANDA:
O, my heart bleeds
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.

PROSPERO:
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
Of all the world I loved and to him put
The manage of my state; as at that time
Through all the signories it was the first
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
The government I cast upon my brother
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou attend me?

MIRANDA:
Sir, most heedfully.

PROSPERO:
Being once perfected how to grant suits,
How to deny them, who to advance and who
To trash for over-topping, new created
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.

MIRANDA:
O, good sir, I do.

PROSPERO:
I pray thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
With that which, but by being so retired,
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
Like a good parent, did beget of him
A falsehood in its contrary as great
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not only with what my revenue yielded,
But what my power might else exact, like one
Who having into truth, by telling of it,
Made such a sinner of his memory,
To credit his own lie, he did believe
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
And executing the outward face of royalty,
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
Dost thou hear?

MIRANDA:
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

PROSPERO:
To have no screen between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
To most ignoble stooping.

MIRANDA:
O the heavens!

PROSPERO:
Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
If this might be a brother.

MIRANDA:
I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.

PROSPERO:
Now the condition.
The King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.

MIRANDA:
Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to't.

PROSPERO:
Hear a little further
And then I'll bring thee to the present business
Which now's upon's; without the which this story
Were most impertinent.

MIRANDA:
Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?

PROSPERO:
Well demanded, wench:
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
A mark so bloody on the business, but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
Did us but loving wrong.

MIRANDA:
Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!

PROSPERO:
O, a cherubim
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Against what should ensue.

MIRANDA:
How came we ashore?

PROSPERO:
By Providence divine.
Some food we had and some fresh water that
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of his charity, being then appointed
Master of this design, did give us, with
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom.

MIRANDA:
Would I might
But ever see that man!

PROSPERO:
Now I arise:
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
Here in this island we arrived; and here
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
Than other princesses can that have more time
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.

MIRANDA:
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm?

PROSPERO:
Know thus far forth.
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.

ARIEL:
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.

PROSPERO:
Hast thou, spirit,
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

ARIEL:
To every article.
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

PROSPERO:
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Would not infect his reason?

ARIEL:
Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
And all the devils are here.'

PROSPERO:
Why that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?

ARIEL:
Close by, my master.

PROSPERO:
But are they, Ariel, safe?

ARIEL:
Not a hair perish'd;
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
The king's son have I landed by himself;
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

PROSPERO:
Of the king's ship
The mariners say how thou hast disposed
And all the rest o' the fleet.

ARIEL:
Safely in harbour
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
Which I dispersed, they all have met again
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
And his great person perish.

PROSPERO:
Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
What is the time o' the day?

ARIEL:
Past the mid season.

PROSPERO:
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
Must by us both be spent most preciously.

ARIEL:
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
Which is not yet perform'd me.

PROSPERO:
How now? moody?
What is't thou canst demand?

ARIEL:
My liberty.

PROSPERO:
Before the time be out? no more!

ARIEL:
I prithee,
Remember I have done thee worthy service;
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
To bate me a full year.

PROSPERO:
Dost thou forget
From what a torment I did free thee?

ARIEL:
No.

PROSPERO:
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do me business in the veins o' the earth
When it is baked with frost.

ARIEL:
I do not, sir.

PROSPERO:
Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?

ARIEL:
No, sir.

PROSPERO:
Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.

ARIEL:
Sir, in Argier.

PROSPERO:
O, was she so? I must
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing, from Argier,
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
They would not take her life. Is not this true?

ARIEL:
Ay, sir.

PROSPERO:
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
Save for the son that she did litter here,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
A human shape.

ARIEL:
Yes, Caliban her son.

PROSPERO:
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
Could not again undo: it was mine art,
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The pine and let thee out.

ARIEL:
I thank thee, master.

PROSPERO:
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.

ARIEL:
Pardon, master;
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spiriting gently.

PROSPERO:
Do so, and after two days
I will discharge thee.

ARIEL:
That's my noble master!
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?

PROSPERO:
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!

MIRANDA:
The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.

PROSPERO:
Shake it off. Come on;
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
Yields us kind answer.

MIRANDA:
'Tis a villain, sir,
I do not love to look on.

PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis,
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! speak.

CALIBAN:

PROSPERO:
Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
Come, thou tortoise! when?
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
Hark in thine ear.

ARIEL:
My lord it shall be done.

PROSPERO:
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

CALIBAN:
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!

PROSPERO:
For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made 'em.

CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in't, and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' the island.

PROSPERO:
Thou most lying slave,
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my child.

CALIBAN:
O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.

PROSPERO:
Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confined into this rock,
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

CALIBAN:
You taught me language; and my profit on't
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me your language!

PROSPERO:
Hag-seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

CALIBAN:
No, pray thee.
I must obey: his art is of such power,
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
and make a vassal of him.

PROSPERO:
So, slave; hence!
Come unto these yellow sands,
And then take hands:
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
The wild waves whist,
Foot it featly here and there;
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
Hark, hark!

FERDINAND:
Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

FERDINAND:
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
And say what thou seest yond.

MIRANDA:
What is't? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.

PROSPERO:
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
And strays about to find 'em.

MIRANDA:
I might call him
A thing divine, for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.

PROSPERO:

FERDINAND:
Most sure, the goddess
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here: my prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?

MIRANDA:
No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.

FERDINAND:
My language! heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where 'tis spoken.

PROSPERO:
How? the best?
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

FERDINAND:
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
The king my father wreck'd.

MIRANDA:
Alack, for mercy!

FERDINAND:
Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain.

PROSPERO:

MIRANDA:
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way!

FERDINAND:
O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
The queen of Naples.

PROSPERO:
Soft, sir! one word more.
They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light.
One word more; I charge thee
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
From me, the lord on't.

FERDINAND:
No, as I am a man.

MIRANDA:
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell with't.

PROSPERO:
Follow me.
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

FERDINAND:
No;
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power.

MIRANDA:
O dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He's gentle and not fearful.

PROSPERO:
What? I say,
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drop.

MIRANDA:
Beseech you, father.

PROSPERO:
Hence! hang not on my garments.

MIRANDA:
Sir, have pity;
I'll be his surety.

PROSPERO:
Silence! one word more
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
An advocate for an imposter! hush!
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban
And they to him are angels.

MIRANDA:
My affections
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man.

PROSPERO:
Come on; obey:
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
And have no vigour in them.

FERDINAND:
So they are;
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.

PROSPERO:

MIRANDA:
Be of comfort;
My father's of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
Which now came from him.

PROSPERO:
Thou shalt be free
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
All points of my command.

ARIEL:
To the syllable.

PROSPERO:
Come, follow. Speak not for him.

GONZALO:
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.

ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
He receives comfort like cold porridge.

ANTONIO:
The visitor will not give him o'er so.

SEBASTIAN:
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
by and by it will strike.

GONZALO:
Sir,--

SEBASTIAN:
One: tell.

GONZALO:
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
Comes to the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN:
A dollar.

GONZALO:
Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
have spoken truer than you purposed.

SEBASTIAN:
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.

GONZALO:
Therefore, my lord,--

ANTONIO:
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

ALONSO:
I prithee, spare.

GONZALO:
Well, I have done: but yet,--

SEBASTIAN:
He will be talking.

ANTONIO:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begins to crow?

SEBASTIAN:
The old cock.

ANTONIO:
The cockerel.

SEBASTIAN:
Done. The wager?

ANTONIO:
A laughter.

SEBASTIAN:
A match!

ADRIAN:
Though this island seem to be desert,--

SEBASTIAN:
Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.

ADRIAN:
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--

SEBASTIAN:
Yet,--

ADRIAN:
Yet,--

ANTONIO:
He could not miss't.

ADRIAN:
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
temperance.

ANTONIO:
Temperance was a delicate wench.

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.

ADRIAN:
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.

SEBASTIAN:
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.

ANTONIO:
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.

GONZALO:
Here is everything advantageous to life.

ANTONIO:
True; save means to live.

SEBASTIAN:
Of that there's none, or little.

GONZALO:
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!

ANTONIO:
The ground indeed is tawny.

SEBASTIAN:
With an eye of green in't.

ANTONIO:
He misses not much.

SEBASTIAN:
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.

GONZALO:
But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
beyond credit,--

SEBASTIAN:
As many vouched rarities are.

GONZALO:
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
salt water.

ANTONIO:
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
say he lies?

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report

GONZALO:
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.

SEBASTIAN:
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.

ADRIAN:
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
their queen.

GONZALO:
Not since widow Dido's time.

ANTONIO:
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
widow Dido!

SEBASTIAN:
What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
how you take it!

ADRIAN:
'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.

GONZALO:
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

ADRIAN:
Carthage?

GONZALO:
I assure you, Carthage.

SEBASTIAN:
His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
raised the wall and houses too.

ANTONIO:
What impossible matter will he make easy next?

SEBASTIAN:
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
and give it his son for an apple.

ANTONIO:
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
forth more islands.

GONZALO:
Ay.

ANTONIO:
Why, in good time.

GONZALO:
Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
of your daughter, who is now queen.

ANTONIO:
And the rarest that e'er came there.

SEBASTIAN:
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.

ANTONIO:
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.

GONZALO:
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.

ANTONIO:
That sort was well fished for.

GONZALO:
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?

ALONSO:
You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?

FRANCISCO:
Sir, he may live:
I saw him beat the surges under him,
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
He came alive to land.

ALONSO:
No, no, he's gone.

SEBASTIAN:
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By all of us, and the fair soul herself
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
son,
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this business' making
Than we bring men to comfort them:
The fault's your own.

ALONSO:
So is the dear'st o' the loss.

GONZALO:
My lord Sebastian,
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you should bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN:
Very well.

ANTONIO:
And most chirurgeonly.

GONZALO:
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.

SEBASTIAN:
Foul weather?

ANTONIO:
Very foul.

GONZALO:
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--

ANTONIO:
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.

SEBASTIAN:
Or docks, or mallows.

GONZALO:
And were the king on't, what would I do?

SEBASTIAN:
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.

GONZALO:
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty;--

SEBASTIAN:
Yet he would be king on't.

ANTONIO:
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.

GONZALO:
All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.

SEBASTIAN:
No marrying 'mong his subjects?

ANTONIO:
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

GONZALO:
I would with such perfection govern, sir,
To excel the golden age.

SEBASTIAN:
God save his majesty!

ANTONIO:
Long live Gonzalo!

GONZALO:
And,--do you mark me, sir?

ALONSO:
Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.

GONZALO:
I do well believe your highness; and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at nothing.

ANTONIO:
'Twas you we laughed at.

GONZALO:
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
to you: so you may continue and laugh at
nothing still.

ANTONIO:
What a blow was there given!

SEBASTIAN:
An it had not fallen flat-long.

GONZALO:
You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing.

SEBASTIAN:
We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.

ANTONIO:
Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

GONZALO:
No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
me asleep, for I am very heavy?

ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and hear us.

ALONSO:
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
They are inclined to do so.

SEBASTIAN:
Please you, sir,
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter.

ANTONIO:
We two, my lord,
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.

ALONSO:
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

SEBASTIAN:
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

ANTONIO:
It is the quality o' the climate.

SEBASTIAN:
Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Myself disposed to sleep.

ANTONIO:
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.

SEBASTIAN:
What, art thou waking?

ANTONIO:
Do you not hear me speak?

SEBASTIAN:
I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
And yet so fast asleep.

ANTONIO:
Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking.

First citizen:
Before we go any further, listen to me speak.

All:
Speak, speak.

First citizen:
Are you all resolved to die rather than starve?

All:
Resolved. resolved.

First citizen:
First, you know that Caius Marcius is the main enemy of the people.

All:
We don't know, we don't know.

First citizen:
Let us kill him, and we will have wheat at our price.
Isn't that a verdict?

All:
Let's stop talking about it ; so be it: far, far!

Second citizen:
A word, good citizens.

First citizen:
We are considered poor citizens, patricians as good ones.
By what authority would we be relieved: if they
would only bring us the superfluous, whereas that was the case
healthy, one could believe that they gave us human relief;
but they find us too dear: the thinness which
who afflicts us, the object of our misery, is like a
inventory to clarify their abundance; OUR
suffering is gain for them. Let's avenge this with
our pikes, before we become rakes: for the gods know that I
say this with hunger for bread, and not with thirst for vengeance.

Second citizen:
Are you taking special action against Caius Marcius?

All:
Against him first: he is a very dog for the common people.

Second citizen:
Do you consider what services he rendered to his country?

First citizen:
Alright; and could be content to give him good
strong report, but it pays for itself by being proud.

Second citizen:
No, but don't speak unkindly.

First citizen:
I tell you, what he did famously, he did
to this end: although men of gentle conscience may
happy to say that he did it for his country
to please his mother and be partly proud; that he
is, even to the altitude of his virtue.

Second citizen:
What he can't help in his nature, you count for one
vice in him. In no case should it be said that he is greedy.

First citizen:
If I must not, I must not be without accusation;
it has faults, with excess, to make one tire of repetition.
What screams are these? The other side of town
is resurrected: why do we stay chatting here? at the Capitol!

All:
Come come.

First citizen:
Soft! who comes here?

Second citizen:
The worthy Menenius Agrippa; the one who always loved
people.

First citizen:
He is quite honest: would everything else be like this!

MENNIUS:
What work do you, my compatriots, have in progress? where are you going
With bats and clubs? The question? speak, please.

First citizen:
Our affair is not unknown in the Senate; they have
we had an idea this fortnight of what we intended to do,
which we will now show them in deeds. They say poor
the suitors breathe heavily: they will know us
also have strong arms.

MENNIUS:
Well, masters, my good friends, my honest neighbors,
Are you going to undo yourself?

First citizen:
We can't, sir, we're already defeated.

MENNIUS:
I tell you, my friends, the most charitable care
Have the patricians among you. For your desires,
Your suffering in this scarcity, you may as well
Hit the sky with your sticks by lifting them
Against the Roman State, whose conduct will continue
As it should, break ten thousand sidewalks
A bond stronger than ever
Appear in your obstacle. For the scarcity,
It is the gods, not the patricians, who do it, and
Your knees in front of them, not your arms, should help you. A lack,
You are transported by calamity
Where more awaits you and slanders you
The leaders of the state, who care for you like fathers,
When you curse them as enemies.

First citizen:
Take care of us! True, indeed! They never cared about us
yet: let us starve, and their warehouses
stuffed with cereal; make edicts for usury, for
supporting loan sharks; repeal every healthy act daily
established against the rich, and provide more
break through the statuses daily, to chain and retain
poor people. If wars do not devour us, they will; And
there is all the love they have for us.

MENNIUS:
Either it is necessary
Admit yourself wonderfully malicious,
Or be accused of insanity. I'll tell you
A lovely story: perhaps you have heard it;
But since this meets my expectations, I will venture
To stale a little more.

First citizen:
Well, I will hear it, sir: but you must not think of
spoil our disgrace with a story: but, please
you, deliver.

MENNIUS:
There was a time when all members of the body
Rebelled against the belly, therefore accused it:
It's only like an abyss that he remained
I am in the middle of the body, idle and inactive,
Always putting away the meat, without ever supporting
Like working with the rest, where the other instruments
I saw and heard, conceived, instructed, walked, felt,
And, mutually participating, the minister
To common appetite and affection
Of the whole body. The belly replied:

First citizen:
Well, sir, what response did the stomach make?

MENNIUS:
Sir, I will tell you. With a kind of smile,
Which never came from the lungs, but still...
Cause, look at you, I can make your belly smile
In addition to speaking - he responded in a mocking tone
To the discontented, to the mutineers
This envied his receipt; Still, it’s very appropriate.
While you slander our senators for this
They are not like you.

First citizen:
Your stomach's response? What!
The royally crowned head, the vigilant eye,
The heart advises, the arm our soldier,
Our horse is the leg, the tongue is our trumpet.
With other ammunition and small aids
In our fabric, if that's the case, they...

MENNIUS:
So what ?
“For me, this guy speaks!” So what ? so what ?

First citizen:
If the cormorant's belly were to be restrained,
Who is the sink of the body, -

MENNIUS:
Well, so what?

First citizen:
The former agents, if they complained,
What could the stomach say?

MENNIUS:
I am going to tell you
If you give a little of what you have little,
Be patient a little, you will hear the response from your stomach.

First citizen:
You've been talking about it for a long time.

MENNIUS:
Note this to me, good friend;
Your most serious stomach was deliberate,
Not reckless like his accusers, and he replied thus:
“It is true, my incorporated friends,” he said,
'Let me first receive the general food,
On which you live; and he is in good shape,
Because I am the store and the boutique
Of the whole body: but, if you remember,
I send it through the rivers of your blood,
Even at court, in the heart, in the seat of the brain;
And, through the cranks and desks of man,
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive this natural skill
What they live by: and although suddenly,
You, my good friends, said the belly, notice me,

First citizen:
Yes sir ; well well.

MENNIUS:
"Even if suddenly I can't
See what I deliver to everyone,
However, I can invent my audit, that's all
Receive from me the flour of all,
And only leaves me the sound. What do you say ?

First citizen:
It was an answer: how do you apply this?

MENNIUS:
The senators of Rome are this good belly,
And you, the mutinous members; for exam
Their advice and care digest things well
By touching the wealth of the common, you will find
No public benefits you receive
But it proceeds or comes from them to you
And no way on your part. What do you think,
You, the big toe of this assembly?

First citizen:
Me big toe! why the big toe?

MENNIUS:
For this, being one of the lowest, lowest, poorest,
Of this wisest rebellion, you are the first:
You rascal, who is the worst blood to run,
Lead first to gain an advantage.
But prepare your snowshoes and your stiff clubs:
Rome and its rats are about to fight;
One side must have a ball.
Hail, noble Marcius!

MARCIUS:
THANKS. What is it, dissident rascals,
This, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Do you make crusts?

First citizen:
We always have your good word.

MARCIUS:
He who gives you good words will flatter
Below abhorrent. What would you like, bastards,
Doesn’t that sound like peace or war? the one who scares you,
The other makes you proud. The one who trusts you,
Where he should find you lions, he finds you hares;
Where are the foxes, the geese: you are no more sure, no,
Than the burning coal on the ice,
Or hail in the sun. Your virtue is
To dignify him whose offense subjects him
And cursed that justice did it.
Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hatred; and your affections are
The appetite of a sick man, who desires this most
Which would increase his pain. Him, it depends
On your favors swim with fins of lead
And he cuts down the oaks with rushes. Hang in there! Do you trust?
Every minute you change your mind,
And call him noble, which was now your hatred,
Him vile was your garland. What is the problem,
That in these different places of the city
You cry out against the noble Senate, which,
Under the gods, keeps you in awe, what else
Would they feed on each other? What are they looking for?

MENNIUS:
For corn at their own rates; of what, they say,
The city is well stocked.

MARCIUS:
Hang them! They say!
They'll sit by the fire and pretend to know
What happened at the Capitol? who likes to get up,
Who prospers and who declines? secondary factions
and give
Conjectural marriages; make parties strong
And the weak who are not to their liking
Under their cobbled shoes. They say there is
enough cereal!
Would the nobility put aside its cruelty,
And let me use my sword, I'll make a career
With thousands of these quartered slaves, so high
How I could choose my spear.

MENNIUS:
Moreover, they are almost completely convinced;
For although they are abundantly lacking in discretion,
Yet they pass cowardly. But I beg you,
What does the other troop say?

MARCIUS:
They are dissolved: hang them!
They said they were hungry; sighed proverbs,
This hunger has broken down the stone walls, which dogs must eat,
This meat was made for mouths, which the gods did not send
Corn reserved for rich men: with these shreds
They expressed their complaints; to which being answered,
And a petition was granted to them, a strange petition...
To break the heart of generosity,
And make the bold power pale - they have thrown away their caps
As they would hang them on the horns of the moon,
Shouting their emulation.

MENNIUS:
What is granted to them?

MARCIUS:
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdom,
Of their choice: their Junius Brutus,
Sicinius Velutus, and I don't know... "Dead!"
The populace should have first opened the roof of the city,
Before it prevailed over me: it will in time
Gain Power and Launch Bigger Themes
We argue about the insurrection.

MENNIUS:
This is strange.

MARCIUS:
Come on, go home, fragments!

Messenger:
Where is Caius Marcius?

MARCIUS:
Here: what is there?

Messenger:
The news, sir, is that the Volscians are in arms.

MARCIUS:
I'm happy with that: then we'll have ways to let off steam
Our moldy superfluity. See, our best elders.

First senator:
Marcius, it is true that you told us this recently;
The Volscians are in arms.

MARCIUS:
They have a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, this will encourage you.
I sin by envying his nobility,
And if I were something other than what I am,
I would only wish for him.

COMINIUS:
You fought together.

MARCIUS:
Were half or half the world by the ears and him.
At my party, I would rebel to do
Only my wars with him: he's a lion
That I am proud to hunt.

First senator:
Then, worthy Marcius,
Witness Cominius in these wars.

COMINIUS:
This is your old promise.

MARCIUS:
Sir, it is true;
And I am consistent. Titus Lartius, you
I will see myself once again punching Tullus in the face.
What, are you stiff? do you stand out?

TITUS:
No, Caius Marcius;
I will lean on one crutch and fight with the other,
We will stand behind this matter.

MENNIUS:
O true blood!

First senator:
Your company at the Capitol; where, I know,
Our greatest friends assist us.

TITUS:

COMINIUS:
Noble Marcius!

First senator:

MARCIUS:
No, let them follow:
The Volscians have a lot of wheat; take those rats there
To gnaw their attics. Venerable mutineers,
Your value manifests: pray, follow.

SICINIUS:
Was man ever as proud as Marcius?

BRUTUS:
He has no equal.

SICINIUS:
When we were elected tribunes of the people,

BRUTUS:
Have you marked his lips and eyes?

SICINIUS:
No. but his taunts.

BRUTUS:
Moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.

SICINIUS:
Make fun of the modest moon.

BRUTUS:
The current wars devour him: he has grown
Too proud to be so valiant.

SICINIUS:
Such nature,
Tickled by success, disdains the shadow
On which he walks at noon: but I wonder
His insolence can be commanded
Under Cominius.

BRUTUS:
The fame, at which he aims,
In whom he is already well pardoned, he cannot
Better to be detained nor more affected than by
A place below the first: what causes a miscarriage
It will be the general's fault, even if he executes
To the maximum of one man, and dizzying censorship
Then go shout out Marcius 'O if he
I had put up with it! »

SICINIUS:
Additionally, if all goes well,
The opinion which sticks so closely to Marcius must
Deprive Cominius of his demerits.

BRUTUS:
Come:
Half of all Cominius honors go to Marcius.
Although Marcius did not deserve them, and all his faults
Marcius will be honored, even if indeed
He deserves nothing in any way.

SICINIUS:
Let's go and listen
How shipping is carried out and in what manner,
More than its singularity, it will
On this present action.

BRUTUS:
Let's go.

First senator:
So your opinion is, Aufidius,
That they from Rome are registered in our councils
And know how we do it.

AUFIDIUS:
It's not yours?
Whatever anyone ever thought in this state,
This could be brought to a bodily act before Rome
Was there a workaround? It hasn't been four days
Since I heard about it; here are the words: I think
I have the letter here; Yes it's here.
“They put pressure on a power, but we don’t know it
Whether in the East or in the West: the scarcity is great;
The people mutiny; and it's the rumor,
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
Who is more hated from Rome than from you,
And Titus Lartius, a very valiant Roman,
These three lead this preparation
Where is it leaning: This is probably for you:
Think about it.

First senator:
Our army is on the ground
We never doubted yet but Rome was ready
To answer us.

AUFIDIUS:
You didn't think it was crazy either
To keep your grand pretensions veiled until when
Their needs must be manifested; which
upon hatching,
It seemed, seemed in Rome. Through discovery.
We will be shortened in our goal, which was
To visit in many cities before almost Rome
I should have known we were on foot.

Second senator:
Noble Aufidius,
Take your commission; Hello to your groups:
Let's leave ourselves alone to guard Corioli:
If they have filed before, for withdrawal
Bring your army; but I think you will find
They didn't prepare for us.

AUFIDIUS:
Oh, doubt it not;
I'm talking about certainties. No, even more,
Some bits of their power have already gone out,
And only so far. I leave your honors.
If we and Caius Marcius are lucky enough to meet,
It is sworn between us that we will strike one day
Until we can't take it anymore.

All:
The gods help you!

AUFIDIUS:
And protect your honors!

First senator:
Farewell.

Second senator:
Farewell.

All:
Farewell.

VOLUMNIA:
I pray you, my daughter, sing; or express yourself in a way
more comfortable type: if my son were my husband, I
should more freely rejoice in this absence where he
earned honor only in the embraces of his bed where
he would show the most love. When, however, he was only one
with the tender body and the only son of my womb, when
the young people with their snatched beauty all look towards him, when
for a day of kings' supplications, a mother should not
sell it within an hour of his sight, me, considering
how honor would become such a person. that was
no better than a painting to hang on the wall, if
fame did not make him move, pleased to let him search
danger where he hoped to find glory. To a cruel
the war I sent to him; where he came back from, his eyebrows
bound with oak. I tell you, girl, I didn't jump
more joy in learning for the first time that he was a man-child
that now, seeing for the first time, it had revealed itself a
man.

VIRGILIA:
But if he had died in the affair, madam; How then?

VOLUMNIA:
Then his good report should have been my son; I
in there would have found a problem. Listen to me profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
the same and no less expensive than yours and my property
Marcius, I would have preferred that eleven had died nobly for their
country that we voluptuously satiate ourselves out of combat.

Lady :
Madam, Lady Valeria has come to visit you.

VIRGILIA:
Please grant me permission to withdraw.

VOLUMNIA:
Indeed, you won't.
It seems to me that I hear your husband's drum here,
See him snatch Aufidius by the hair,
As children of a bear, the Volscians avoid it:
It seems to me that I see him stamping like this and calling like this:
“Come on, cowards! you were scared,
Even if you were born in Rome: his bloody forehead
With his hand meshed then wiping, he goes,
Like a harvester charged with mowing
Or everything or lose your job.

VIRGILIA:
His bloody forehead! O Jupiter, no blood!

VOLUMNIA:
Go away, you idiot! he becomes more of a man
Than to gild her trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
When she breastfed Hector, she didn't look any better
Than Hector's forehead when he spits blood
With the Greek sword, contemptuous. Tell Valeria,
We are able to welcome him.

VIRGILIA:
Heaven bless my fallen lord Aufidius!

VOLUMNIA:
He will strike Aufidius' head under his knee
And step on his neck.

VALériE:
Ladies, have a good day to you both.

VOLUMNIA:
Sweet lady.

VIRGILIA:
I am happy to see Your Lady.

VALériE:
How are you both? you are true guardians of the house.
What are you sewing here? A beautiful place, in good
faith. How is your grandson?

VIRGILIA:
I thank your Lady; well, good lady.

VOLUMNIA:
He preferred to see swords and hear a drum rather than
look at his schoolmaster.

VALériE:
O my word, the father's son: I will swear that he is a
very pretty boy. O' my faith, I looked at it o'
Wednesday half an hour together: to such
confirmed face. I saw him chasing a walleye
butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
Again; and after again; and again and again he
comes, and again; I caught it again; or if its
the fall made him angry, or how it was, he did
teeth and tear it; O, I guarantee it, how he mammured himself
he!

VOLUMNIA:
One about the father's mood.

VALériE:
Indeed, he is a noble child.

VIRGILIA:
A crack, ma'am.

VALériE:
Come, drop off your embroidery; I have to make you play
the maid idle with me this afternoon.

VIRGILIA:
No, good madam; I won't go out.

VALériE:
Not outside!

VOLUMNIA:
She will, she will.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, no, by your patience; I won't end it
threshold until my lord returns from the wars.

VALériE:
Well, you lock yourself in unreasonably: come,
you must go and visit the good lady who lives there.

VIRGILIA:
I will wish him speedy strength and visit him with
my prayers; but I can't go.

VOLUMNIA:
Why, please?

VIRGILIA:
It is not to save work, nor to love.

VALériE:
You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, everything
the thread she spun in Ulysses' absence only filled
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would like your cambric
were sensible as your finger, so you could leave
sting him out of pity. Come, you will come with us.

VIRGILIA:
No, good madam, forgive me; in fact, I won't go out.

VALériE:
Truly, come with me; and I will tell you
great news from your husband.

VIRGILIA:
O, good lady, there cannot be any more.

VALériE:
In truth, I am not joking with you; news arrived from
him last night.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, madam?

VALériE:
Seriously, it's true; I heard a senator say it.
So it is: the Volscians have an army in front; against
from which general Cominius left, with part of
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are ready
in front of their town Corioli; they have no doubt
predominant and to make brief wars. It's true,
on my honor; and therefore, I pray, come with us.

VIRGILIA:
Excuse me, good lady; I will obey you in everything
thing afterwards.

VOLUMNIA:
Leave her alone, madame: as she is now, she will only
illness is our best joy.

VALériE:
In truth, I think she would. Then good luck.
Come, my good and sweet lady. Please, Virgilia, turn your
solemnity outside. and come with us.

VIRGILIA:
No, in one word, madam; in fact, I don't have to do it. I wish
you are very cheerful.

VALériE:
Well, goodbye.

MARCIUS:
The news comes there. A bet that they succeeded.

LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, no.

MARCIUS:
It's done.

LARTIUS:
Agreed.

MARCIUS:
Say, has our general encountered the enemy?

Messenger:
They are visible; but I haven't spoken yet.

LARTIUS:
So the right horse is mine.

MARCIUS:
I'll buy it from you.

LARTIUS:
No, I will not sell it or give it away: I will lend it to you
For half a century. Summon the city.

MARCIUS:
How far away are these armies?

Messenger:
In this kilometer and a half.

MARCIUS:
Then we will hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, Mars, please make us quick in work,
So that we can leave here with smoking swords,
To help our friends on the ground! Come, blow your breath.
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

First senator:
No, nor a man who fears you less than him,
It's less than a little.
Listen ! our drums
Let us give birth to our youth. We will break down our walls,
Rather than shelling us: our doors,
Which nevertheless seem closed, we have only been pinned by rushes;
They will open on their own.
Listen to yourself. far away!
There is Aufidius; list, what work he does
Among your divided army.

MARCIUS:
Oh, there they are!

LARTIUS:
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!

MARCIUS:
They do not fear us, but they are taking out their city.
Now put your shields before your heart and fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:
They despise us far beyond our thoughts,
Which makes me sweat with anger. Come on, my friends:
Whoever retires, I will take him for a Volsce,
And he will feel my sharpness.

MARCIUS:
All the contagion of the south falls on you,
Shame of Rome! your herd of... Boils and sores
Coat yourself, that you may be abhorred
Further than what we see and one infects the other
Against the wind a mile! You, souls of geese,
Who wear the form of men, how did you run
Slaves that monkeys would beat! Pluto and hell!
Everyone was injured behind; the back is red and the face is pale
With flight and aggravated fear! Repair and charge at home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I will leave the enemy
And wage my wars against you: be careful: go;
If you hold on, we'll beat them down to their women,
As they followed us towards our trenches.
So, now the doors are open: now prove the correct seconds:
It is for the followers that fortune enlarges them,
Not for flyers: tag me and do the same.

First soldier:
Imprudence; not me.

Second soldier:
Nor me.

First soldier:
You see, they locked him up.

All:
In the pot, I guarantee it.

LARTIUS:
What happened to Marcius?

All:
Killed, sir, without a doubt.

First soldier:
Following the leaflets on the heels,
With them he enters; who, suddenly,
Applauded at their doors: he himself is alone,
To meet the whole city.

LARTIUS:
O noble man!
Who reasonably surpasses his senseless sword,
And when he bows, he rises. You are left, Marcius:
A whole carbuncle, as big as you,
Were not such a rich gem. You were a soldier
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
Only by strokes; but, with your sinister looks and
The thunderous percussion of your sounds,
You make your enemies tremble, as if the world
They were feverish and shaking.

First soldier:
Listen, sir.

LARTIUS:
Oh, it's Marcius!
Let's go get it, or let's keep it the same.

First Roman:
This is what I will wear in Rome.

Second Roman:
And me that.

Third Roman:
A murrain, not! I took it for money.

MARCIUS:
See here these movers who value their hours
To a cracked drachma! Cushions, lead spoons,
Fetters of a must, doublets that the executioners would make
Bury with those who carried them, these vile slaves,
Before the fight is over, pack your bags: down with them!
And listen, what a noise the general is making! To him!
This is the man my soul hates, Aufidius,
Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
Practical numbers to do good for the city;
While I, with those who are in spirit, will hasten
To help Cominius.

LARTIUS:
Worthy sir, you are bleeding;
Your exercise was too violent for
A second combat lesson.

MARCIUS:
Sir, don't praise me;
My work hasn't warmed me up yet: good luck:
The blood I shed is rather physical
Than dangerous for me: for Aufidius thus
I will appear and fight.

LARTIUS:
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall deeply in love with you; and its great charms
Stun your opponents' swords! Mister bold,
Prosperity be your page!

MARCIUS:
Your friend and more
Only those she places highest! So good bye.

LARTIUS:
You, the most worthy Marcius!
Go and sound the trumpet in the market place;
Call there all the officers of the city,
Where they will know our spirit: far away!

COMINIUS:
Breathe, my friends: well fought;
we left
Like the Romans, neither foolish in our positions,
Nor a coward in retirement: believe me, gentlemen,
We will be accused again. While we knocked,
By actings and transmission of bursts we heard
The accusations of our friends. Roman gods!
Direct their successes as we wish ours,
That our two powers, smiling
foreheads meeting,
Can offer you a grateful sacrifice.
Your news ?

Messenger:
The citizens of Corioli issued,
And gave to Lartius and Marcius the battle:
I saw our group heading towards their trenches,
And then I left.

COMINIUS:
Even if you tell the truth,
It seems to me that you don't speak well.
How long has it been?

Messenger:
More than an hour, my lord.

COMINIUS:
It's not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
How could you, in one kilometer, confuse an hour,
And you bring your news so late?

Messenger:
Spies of the Volscians
Kept me on the hunt, and I was forced to ride
About three or four miles, otherwise I would have, sir,
Half an hour has passed since my report.

COMINIUS:
Who is there,
Does it look like he was skinned? O gods
It bears the seal of Marcius; and I have
Before, I saw it like that.

MARCIUS:

COMINIUS:
The shepherd does not know the thunder of a tabor
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
Of every bad man.

MARCIUS:
Am I coming too late?

COMINIUS:
Yes, if you don't come with the blood of others,
But wrapped in yours.

MARCIUS:
O, let me cut you
In arms as healthy as when I courted, in the heart
As joyful as when our wedding day was over,
And candles burned all the way to bed!

COMINIUS:
Flower of warriors,
How are things going with Titus Lartius?

MARCIUS:
As for a man busy with decrees:
Sentencing some to death and others to exile;
Ransom him, or have pity, threaten the other;
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
Even like a flattering greyhound on a leash,
To let it slide at will.

COMINIUS:
Where is this slave
Who told me they beat you down to your trenches?
Where is he? call it here.

MARCIUS:
Leave him alone;
He spoke the truth: but for our gentlemen,
The common file, a scourge! stands for them!
The mouse never avoided the cat because it moved
Rascals worse than them.

COMINIUS:
But how did you succeed?

MARCIUS:
Will time tell? I do not think so.
Where is the enemy? are you the lords of the land?
Otherwise, why stop until you are?

COMINIUS:
Marcius,
We were at a disadvantage and fought
Retire to achieve our goal.

MARCIUS:
How does their fight take place? do you know which side
Did they place their trusted men?

COMINIUS:
As I suppose, Marcius,
Their bands in the vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best confidence; on them Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope.

MARCIUS:
I beg you,
Through all the battles we have fought,
By the blood we shed together, by the vows
We made friends last, that you directly
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
And that you do not delay the present, but,
Filling the air with advanced swords and darts,
We are proving it at this very hour.

COMINIUS:
Even though I could wish
You were led to a gentle bath
And balms applied to you, but I will never dare
Deny your request: choose from these
This can better help your action.

MARCIUS:
They are the ones
Most want it. If there are any here...
As if it were a sin to doubt - who like this painting
Where you see me smeared; if I'm afraid
Less his person than a bad relationship;
If anyone thinks a brave death trumps a bad life
And that his country is dearer than him;
Leave him alone, or so many others who wish,
Make a sign thus, to express his disposition,
And follow Marcius.
Oh me alone! make you a sword of me?
If these manifestations are not external, which of you
But are four Volsces? none of you are
Able to resist the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
But thanks everyone, should I select
of all: the rest
Must bear the matter in another fight,
As the cause will be obeyed. Please walk;
And four of them will quickly bring out my command,
Which men are most inclined.

COMINIUS:
Walk, my friends:
Realize this ostentation, and you will
Split it all up with us.

LARTIUS:
So let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
As I filed them. If I send, send
These centuries to our aid: the rest will serve us
For a short outfit: if we lose ground,
We can't keep the city.

Lieutenant:
Do not be afraid of our care, sir.

LARTIUS:
Therefore, close your doors.
Our guide, come; take us to the Roman camp.

MARCIUS:
I will only fight with you; because I hate you
Worse than a promise breaker.

AUFIDIUS:
We hate the same:
It's not Afric who owns a snake that I abhor
More than your fame and your desire. Fix your foot.

MARCIUS:
May the first parakeet die a slave to the other,
And the gods will condemn him afterwards!

AUFIDIUS:
If I steal, Marcius,
Hello me like a hare.

MARCIUS:
During these three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought within your walls of Corioli,
And I did the work I liked: it's not my blood
Where you see me masked; for your revenge
Increase your power to the highest.

AUFIDIUS:
Were you the Hector
It was the whip of your boastful offspring,
You shouldn't escape me here.
Officious and not valiant, you put me to shame
In your doomed seconds.

COMINIUS:
If I were to talk to you about your daily work,
You wouldn't believe your actions: but I will report it
Where the senators will mix tears and smiles,
Where the great patricians will be present and shrug their shoulders,
I admire the ending, where the ladies will be afraid,
And, joyfully shaken, hear more; where the
boring stands,
Who, with the rebellious plebeians, hate your honors,
Will say against their heart "We thank the gods
Our Rome has such a soldier.
Yet you came to a piece of this party,
Having completely dined before.

LARTIUS:
O general,
Here is the courier, we caparison him:
Would you have seen...

MARCIUS:
Pray now, pray no more: my mother,
Who has a charter to exalt his blood,
When she congratulates me, it saddens me. I did
As you did; this is what I can; induced
As you have been; this is for my country:
The one who only carried out his good will
I overstepped my act.

COMINIUS:
You will not be
The grave of your merit; Rome must know
The value of his: 'it was a cover-up
Worse than theft, no less than a translation,
To hide your actions; and to silence that,
Who, at the spire and summit of guaranteed praise,
This seems modest: that's why I beg you
As a sign of what you are, not to reward
What you did... before our army heard me.

MARCIUS:
I got some wounds on me, and they're smart
To hear yourself remember.

COMINIUS:
Shouldn't they,
Well, they might rage against ingratitude,
And tempts himself with death. Of all the horses,
Of which we took a good and good store, of all
The treasure in this area reaches and the city,
We return the tenth to you, to be withdrawn,
Before common distribution,
Your only choice.

MARCIUS:
I thank you, general;
But I can't make my heart agree to take
A bribe to pay for my sword: I refuse it;
And stand on my common share with these
This saw action.

MARCIUS:
That these same instruments that you desecrate,
Never ring the bell again! when the drums and trumpets
I' the field proves flattering, may the courts and cities be
Done all in fake soothing face!
When steel becomes soft as the parasite's silk,
Let it serve as a cover for wars!
No more, I say! For this I did not wash
My nose that bled, or that outwitted some miserable idiot.
What, without any remark, many others have done, -
You scream at me
In hyperbolic cheers;
As if I loved my little one, I had to go on a diet
Praises embellished with lies.

COMINIUS:
You are too modest;
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us who truly give to you: through your patience,
If you are angry with yourself, we will detain you,
Like someone who wants his own harm, with handcuffs,
So reason with yourself safely. Therefore, know this,
As for us, for the whole world, this Caius Marcius
Wear the garland of this war: in sign of which,
My noble steed, known in the camp, I give him,
With all its trimmings belonging; and from that moment on,
For what he did before Corioli, call him,
With all the applause and clamor of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
The addition nobly ever!

All:
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
I'm going to go wash;
And when my face is beautiful, you will perceive
Whether I blush or not: nevertheless, I thank you.
I want to ride your horse, and anytime
To highlight your good addition
To the equity of my power.

COMINIUS:
So, to our tent;
Where, before we rest, we will write
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
Must return to Corioli: send us to Rome
The best, with whom we can articulate,
For their own sake and ours.

LARTIUS:
I will, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
The gods are starting to laugh at me. Me, this now
Refused the most princely gifts, I am forced to beg
From my lord general.

COMINIUS:
Take it ; it's yours. This is t?

CORIOLANUS:
Sometimes I lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
He shouted to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was in my eyes,
And anger overwhelmed my pity: I ask you
To give freedom to my poor host.

COMINIUS:
Oh, well begged!
If he were my son's butcher, he should
Be free like the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

LARTIUS:
Marcius, his name?

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forget.
I'm tired ; yes, my memory is tired.
Don't we have any wine here?

COMINIUS:
Let's go to our tent:
The blood on your face dries; It's time
We should think about it: come.

AUFIDIUS:
The city is taken!

First soldier:
It will be returned in good condition.

AUFIDIUS:
Condition!
I wish I were Roman; because I can't,
Being a Volsce, let me be one. Condition!
What good condition can a treaty find
Am I the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
I fought with you: you beat me so often,
And I would, I think, if we met
As often as we eat. By the elements,
If I ever meet him beard to beard,
He is mine, or I am his: my emulation
Did he not have this honor? in case
I thought I would crush it with equal force,
Real sword to sword, I'll attack him one way or another
Or anger or cunning can catch him.

First soldier:
It's the devil.

AUFIDIUS:
Bolder, but not so subtle. My worth is poisoned
With only a spot of suffering on his part; for him
Will not fly away from itself: neither sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, neither wilt nor Capitol,
The prayers of the priests nor the times of sacrifice,
The embarkations, all in fury, will rise
Their rotten privileges and customs against
My hatred towards Marcius: where do I find it, even if it
At home, under my brother's care, even there,
Against the hospital cannon, would I have
Wash my fierce hand in the heart. Go to town;
Learn how it happens; and what they are that must
Be hostages of Rome.

First soldier:
Won't you go?

AUFIDIUS:
I am being treated in the cypress grove: please...
It is to the south that the town's mills are located. Bring me a message there.
How is the world going, at its own pace
I can boost my journey.

First soldier:
I will, sir.

MENNIUS:
The omen tells me that we will have news this evening.

BRUTUS:
Good or bad?

MENNIUS:
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
doesn't like Marcius.

SICINIUS:
Nature teaches animals to know their friends.

MENNIUS:
Please, who loves the wolf?

SICINIUS:
The lamb.

MENNIUS:
Yes, to devour it; like the hungry plebeians would do
noble Marcius.

BRUTUS:
It is indeed a lamb, which bathes like a bear.

MENNIUS:
He is indeed a bear, who lives like a lamb. you too
are old men: tell me one thing that I will ask you.

Both:
Well, sir.

MENNIUS:
How poor is Marcius, that you two
Don’t you have an abundance of it?

BRUTUS:
He is not poor in any way, but he is stocked with everything.

SICINIUS:
Especially in pride.

BRUTUS:
And ahead of everyone else in terms of bragging rights.

MENNIUS:
It's strange now: do you both know how you are
censored here in the city, I mean from us, the
right file? do you?

Both:
Why, how are we censored?

MENNIUS:
Since you are talking about pride now, won't you be angry?

Both:
Well, sir, well.

MENNIUS:
Well, it's not a big deal; for a little thief
this occasion will deprive you of a lot of patience:
give the reins to your dispositions and be angry at
your pleasures; at least if you take it as a
it's a pleasure for you to be. You blame Marcius
to be proud ?

BRUTUS:
We don't do it alone, sir.

MENNIUS:
I know you can't do much alone; For your help
are numerous, otherwise your actions would become marvelous
single: your abilities are too infantile to
do a lot of things alone. You speak of pride: oh that you
could turn your eyes to the back of your neck,
and only do an inner investigation into your well-being!
Oh, if you could!

BRUTUS:
And then, sir?

MENNIUS:
Well, then you should discover a pair of undeserved things,
proud, violent and irritable magistrates, alias imbeciles, like
none in Rome.

SICINIUS:
Menenius, you are quite well known too.

MENNIUS:
I am known for being a humorous patrician who
loves a cup of mulled wine without a drop of comfort
The Tiber is not there; we say that it is something imperfect in
favor the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
on a movement that is too trivial; the one who talks more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
in the morning: what I think of pronouncing and spending my time
the nastiness in my breath. Meet two businessmen such as
you are... I cannot call you Lycurgus... if the drink
you give me a negative contact with my palate, I make a
twisted face. I cannot say that your cults have
I have settled the matter well, when I find the ass in it
composed with the majority of your syllables: and
even if I have to be content to put up with those who say
you are serious reverend men, and yet they lie mortally
I tell you that you have good faces. If you see this in
the map of my microcosm, it follows that I am known
pretty good too? what barm can your bison
conspectuities gleaned from this character, if I am
quite well known too?

BRUTUS:
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

MENNIUS:
You don't know me, or yourselves, or anything. You
are ambitious for the caps and legs of poor rascals: you
spend a good healthy morning hearing a
argument between an orange woman and a seller of dimples;
then postpone the controversy from three pence to one
second day of hearing. When you hear a
it's a question between party and party, if you are lucky enough to be
pinched by colic, you make grimaces like
moms; raise the bloody flag against all
patience; and, roaring for a chamber pot,
reject the most tangled bleeding controversy
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
the cause is that he treats both parties as knaves. You are
a pair of strange ones.

BRUTUS:
Come, come, you are well known to be a
chatter more perfect for the table than necessary
advisor to the Capitol.

MENNIUS:
Our priests themselves must become mockers, if they want
encounter subjects as ridiculous as you. When
you speak best to the goal, it's not worth it
wiggle your beard; and your beard doesn't deserve
a grave so honorable that it would fill that of a bastard
cushion, or be buried in a donkey bag-
saddle. Yet you must say: Marcius is proud;
which, wisely, is worth its predecessors
since Deucalion, although perhaps some of the
the best of them were hereditary executioners. God-den to
your worship: a greater part of your conversation
infect my brain, being the shepherds of the beasts
plebeians: I will have the audacity to take leave of you.
Well, my ladies as beautiful as they are noble, and the moon,
if it was earthly, it was not nobler, - where do you follow
your eyes so quickly?

VOLUMNIA:
Honorable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; For
Juno's love is gone.

MENNIUS:
Ha! Marcius is coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
Yes, worthy Menenius; and with the most prosperous
approval.

MENNIUS:
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank you. Whoa!
Marcius is coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
No it is true.

VOLUMNIA:
Look, here is a letter from him: the State has
another, his wife another; and I think there is one
at home for you.

MENNIUS:
Tonight I will turn my house around: a letter to
Me!

VIRGILIA:
Yes, of course, there is a letter for you; I have not seen it.

MENNIUS:
A letter for me! that gives me a succession of seven
years of health; at what point will I make a lip
the doctor: the most sovereign prescription in
Galen is only empirical, and, at this level of conservation,
there is no better connection than a horse bath. Is it
not injured? he had a habit of coming home injured.

VIRGILIA:
Oh, no, no, no.

VOLUMNIA:
Oh, he is hurt; I thank the gods for that.

MENNIUS:
Me too, if it's not too much: bring a'
victory in your pocket? the wounds belong to him.

VOLUMNIA:
On's eyebrows: Menenius, he comes home for the third time
with the oak garland.

MENNIUS:
Did he properly punish Aufidius?

VOLUMNIA:
Titus Lartius writes that they fought together, but
Aufidius went down.

MENNIUS:
And it was the moment for him too, I guarantee him that:
and he had stayed by her side, I wouldn't have been like that
fidiused for all Corioli chests, and gold
it's in them. Does the Senate have this?

VOLUMNIA:
Ladies, let's go. Yes Yes Yes; the Senate
has letters from the general, in which he gives my
son all the name of the war: he has in this
the action has doubly surpassed its previous acts

VALériE:
Truly, wonderful things have been said about him.

MENNIUS:
Wonderful! yes, I guarantee it, and not without sound
real purchase.

VIRGILIA:
The gods grant them the truth!

VOLUMNIA:
TRUE! poof, wow.

MENNIUS:
TRUE! I will swear they are real.
Where is he injured?
God keep your good worship! Marcius arrives
at home: he has more reasons to be proud. Where is he injured?

VOLUMNIA:
I have the shoulder and I have the left arm there will be
great scars to show the people, when they do
take his place. He received against the rejection of
Tarquin seven hurts the body.

MENNIUS:
One in the neck, and two in the thigh, there is
nine that I know of.

VOLUMNIA:
Before this last expedition he was twenty-five
injuries on him.

MENNIUS:
It is now 9 p.m.: every cut was the grave of an enemy.
Listen ! trumpets.

VOLUMNIA:
They are the bailiffs of Marcius: before him he
carries noise, and behind it it leaves tears:
Death, that dark spirit, rests in his sinewy arm;
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.

Herald:
Know, Rome, that Marcius fought alone
At the gates of Corioli: where he won,
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
In honor follows Coriolanus.
Welcome to Rome, famous Coriolanus!

All:
Welcome to Rome, famous Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
None of that anymore; It hurts my heart:
Pray now, no more.

COMINIUS:
Look, sir, at your mother!

CORIOLANUS:
Oh,
You have, I know, petitioned all the gods
For my prosperity!

VOLUMNIA:
No, my good soldier, stand up;
My sweet Marcius, worthy Caius, and
By an act which merits the newly appointed honor, -
What is it ? Coriolanus should I call you?
But oh your wife!

CORIOLANUS:
My gracious silence, salute!
Would you have laughed if I had come home in a coffin,
Who cries when they see me triumph? Yes my dear,
Such eyes bear the widows of Corioli,
And mothers who lack sons.

MENNIUS:
Now the gods crown you!

CORIOLANUS:
And you still live?
O my sweet lady, pardon.

VOLUMNIA:
I don't know where to turn: O, welcome home:
And welcome, general: and you are all welcome.

MENNIUS:
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could cry
And I could laugh, I'm light and heavy. To welcome.
A curse begins at the very root of the heart,
It's not good to see you! There are three of you
Rome should love it: yet, by the faith of men,
We have some old crabs here
at home, this will not be the case
Let yourself be grafted as you wish. But welcome, warriors:
We call a nettle but a nettle and
The faults of fools but madness.

COMINIUS:
Always right.

CORIOLANUS:
Menenius always, always.

Herald:
Give in and move on!

CORIOLANUS:

VOLUMNIA:
I lived
To see inherited my wishes
And the buildings of my fantasy: only
There's one thing missing, which I don't doubt, but
Our Rome will throw itself on you.

CORIOLANUS:
Know, good mother,
I prefer to be their servant in my own way,
Than to influence with them in theirs.

COMINIUS:
On the way to the Capitol!

BRUTUS:
All languages speak of him, and pale visions
We wear glasses to see it: your talkative nurse
In rapture, let her baby cry
While she talks to him: Malkin kitchen pins
His richest lockram about his rough neck,
Climbing the walls to look at it: stalls, bulk, windows,
Are choked, the tracks filled and the ridges ridden
With varying complexions, everyone agrees
Looking forward to seeing it: rarely shown flamens
Squeeze among the popular crowds and blow
To win a vulgar station: or veiled ladies
Engage in the war of whites and damasks
Their dazzling cheeks with free booty
Burning kisses from Phoebus: such a father
As if it was the god who led him
Were sneakily slipped into his human powers
And gave him a graceful posture.

SICINIUS:
At once,
I guarantee him consul.

BRUTUS:
So our office can,
While in power, go to sleep.

SICINIUS:
He cannot carry his honors with moderation
Where it should start and end, but it will
Lose those he won.

BRUTUS:
In this there is comfort.

SICINIUS:
I have no doubt about it
The commoners, whom we defend, but they
About their former wickedness they will forget
For the slightest cause, these new honors, which
That he will give them, I don't ask myself any questions
How proud he is to do so.

BRUTUS:
I heard him swear,
If he ran for consul, he would never do it
I appear on the market nor on him
The impeccable garment of humility;
Nor show, as is the custom, his wounds
To the people, implore their stinking breaths.

SICINIUS:
It's true.

BRUTUS:
It was his word: O, he would rather miss it
Than to wear it to him but in the costume of the nobility,
And the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS:
I don't wish for better
Than ask him to keep this goal and say it
In execution.

BRUTUS:
That's exactly what he will do.

SICINIUS:
It will then be for him according to our good wishes,
Certain destruction.

BRUTUS:
So it must fall
To him or to our authorities. To finish,
We must suggest to people in what hatred
He always held them; it is in power that he would do it
I made them fools, I silenced their litigants and
Dispossessed their freedoms, holding them back,
In human action and capacity,
No more soul or ability in the world
Than the camels in war, which have their provisions
Only to bear burdens and painful blows
For sinking beneath them.

SICINIUS:
This, as you say, suggested
At a time when his growing insolence
Will touch people - whose time will not fail,
If it is put there; and it's that simple
As for putting dogs on sheep, that will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their flame
Will darken it forever.

BRUTUS:
What is the problem?

Messenger:
You are summoned to the Capitol. It is thought
That Marcius will be consul:
I saw the mute men crowding to see him and
The blind to carry it speak: the matrons threw down gloves,
Ladies and servants, their scarves and their handkerchiefs,
On him as he passed: the nobles leaned,
As for the statue of Jupiter and the commons
A downpour and thunder with their caps and their cries:
I have never seen that.

BRUTUS:
Let's go to the Capitol;
And take with us ears and eyes for time,
But with heart for the event.

SICINIUS:
To have with you.

First officer:
Come, come, they're almost there. How many are standing
for consulates?

Second officer:
Three, they say: but it's thought of for everyone
Coriolanus will carry it.

First officer:
He's a good boy; but he is proud to take revenge, and
doesn't like ordinary people.

Second officer:
Well, there have been many great men who have
flattered the people, who never loved them; and there
many of them have loved it, they don't know it
therefore: so that if they love, they do not know why,
they hate not for a better motive: therefore, for
Coriolanus doesn't care if they love or hate
manifests to him the true knowledge that he has in their
arrangement; and by his noble carelessness, lets
they see it clearly.

First officer:
If he didn't care whether he had their love or not,
he waved his hand indifferently without making either
neither good nor evil: but he seeks their hatred with greater
devotion which can return it to him; and leaves
nothing undone that can fully reveal their
opposite. Now, to appear to affect wickedness and
the discontent of the people is as serious as that which they
does not love, to flatter them with their love.

Second officer:
He deserved his country with dignity: and his
the ascent is not made at degrees as easy as those which,
having been flexible and courteous towards the people,
kindnesses, without any other act to have them
one in their estimate and report: but he did
has planted his honors in their eyes, and his actions
in their hearts, that their tongues may be
keeping quiet, and not confessing too much, were a kind of
unrewarding injury; point out the opposite, is a
malice, which, denying itself, would tear away
rebuke and rebuke with every hearing ear.

First officer:
Nothing more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
Arrive.

MENNIUS:
After having determined the Volsces and
It remains to bring Titus Lartius,
As the main point of our post-meeting,
To satisfy his noble service that
Thus defended his country: this is why,
please,
Very reverends and serious elders, to be desired
The current consul and last general
In our well-found successes, to report
A little of this worthy work accomplished
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, that
We met here both to give thanks and to remember
With honors like him.

First senator:
Speak, good Cominius:
Leave nothing out and make us think
Our State rather lacks retaliation
Let us stretch it.
Masters of the people,
We ask for your kindest ears, and afterwards,
Your loving movement towards the common body,
Give in what's going on here.

SICINIUS:
We are summoned
On a pleasant treaty, and have hearts
Prone to honor and move forward
The theme of our assembly.

BRUTUS:
Which is rather
We will be happy to do so, if he remembers
A kinder value of the people than
He has enjoyed them so far.

MENNIUS:
It's off, it's off;
I would have preferred you to keep quiet. Please
To hear Cominius speak?

BRUTUS:
With pleasure ;
But yet my caution was more relevant
Than the reprimand you give him.

MENNIUS:
He loves your people
But tie him up so he's not their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
No, keep your place.

First senator:
Sit down, Coriolanus; never ashamed to hear
Which you nobly did.

CORIOLANUS:
Forgiveness for your horror:
I'd rather my wounds heal again
Than to hear how I got them.

BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope
My words have not destabilized you.

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir: yet often,
When the blows made me stay, I fled the words.
You did not soothe, therefore you did not hurt: but
Your people,
I love them the way they weigh.

MENNIUS:
Pray now, sit down.

CORIOLANUS:
I'd rather scratch my head in the sun
When the alarm sounds, sit with your arms crossed
To hear my monstrous nothings.

MENNIUS:
Masters of the people,
Your multiplier offspring, how can they flatter...
It's a thousand to a good one - when you see now
He prefers to risk all his limbs for honor
That we have the ears to hear it? Go on, Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I shall lack voice: the acts of Coriolanus
Should not be pronounced weakly. It is held
This value is the greatest of virtues, and
Most worthy of the wearer: if so,
The man I'm talking about can't in the world
Be individually counterbalanced. At sixteen-year-old,
When Tarquin headed towards Rome, he fought
Beyond the mark of others: our dictator at the time,
The one I point to with all my praise, I saw him fight,
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
Lips bristling in front of him: be unbridled
A Roman in too much of a hurry and I am from the consul's point of view
Killed three adversaries: Tarquin whom he met,
And smote him on the knee: in the exploits of that day,
When he could play the woman in the scene,
He proved himself the best man on the field, and for his work
Was related to oak. His student age
So the man entered, he became like a sea,
And in seventeen battles since
He made all the swords in the garland waver. For the latter,
Before and at Corioli, let me say,
I can't talk to him at home: he stopped the leaflets;
And by his rare example made the coward
Transforming terror into sport: like the weed before
A sailing ship, so men obeyed
And fell under his rod: his sword, the seal of death,
Where he scored, he took; from face to toe
It was a thing of blood, whose every movement
Was timed with dying cries: alone he entered
The deadly city gate, which he painted
With a destiny without escape; without help, he got away with it,
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now everything is his:
When, little by little, the din of war pierces
His common sense; then straightens his mind doubled
I revived what in flesh was tired,
And he came to battle; where he did
Run stinking men's lives, as if
"It was perpetual spoil: and until we called
Both on the field and in the city, he never stood up
To relieve his chest while panting.

MENNIUS:
A worthy man!

First senator:
He can only live up to the honors
What we design for it.

COMINIUS:
He kicked our booty,
And I considered precious things as they were
The common shit of the world: he covets less
That misery itself would give; rewards
His actions by carrying them out, and he is content
Take the time to finish it.

MENNIUS:
He is right, noble:
Let us call him.

First senator:
Call Coriolanus.

Officer:
It appears.

MENNIUS:
The senate, Coriolanus, is very happy
To make you consul.

CORIOLANUS:
I still owe them
My life and my services.

MENNIUS:
It then remains
That you talk to people.

CORIOLANUS:
I beg you,
Let me go beyond this custom, for I cannot
Put on the robe, stay naked and beg them,
For the love of my wounds, to give their vote: please
So that I can achieve this.

SICINIUS:
Sir, people
Must have their votes; neither will they beat
A piece of ceremony.

MENNIUS:
Put them aside:
Please go adapt to custom and
Take yourself, like your predecessors,
Your honor with your form.

CORIOLANUS:
It's apart
That I will blush while playing, and that I could well
Be taken from the people.

BRUTUS:
Did you notice that?

CORIOLANUS:
To boast to them, I did so, and so;
Show them the callous scars I should hide,
As if I received them for rental
With their breath only!

MENNIUS:
Don't hold on to it.
We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
Our aim towards them: and towards our noble consul
We wish everyone joy and honor.

Senators:
To Coriolanus come all joy and all honor!

BRUTUS:
You see how he intends to use the people.

SICINIUS:
Let them perceive the intention! He will need it,
As if he despised what he asked
Should be in them to give.

BRUTUS:
Come, we will inform them
Of our actions here: on the market,
I know, they help us.

First citizen:
Once, if he needs our votes, we should not deny him.

Second citizen:
We can, sir, if we want.

Third citizen:
We have the power within us to do it, but it is a
a power which we have no power to exercise; because if he shows us
his wounds and tell us about his actions, we must put our
speaks into these wounds and speaks for them; so if
he tells us of his noble deeds, we must also tell him
our noble acceptance from them. Ingratitude is
monstrous, and so that the multitude is ungrateful,
had to make a monster out of the multitude:
of which we, as members, should resolve to be
monstrous limbs.

First citizen:
And not to make us think better, a little help
be used for; for once we stood up about the corn, it
he himself tried not to call us the many-headed multitude.

Third citizen:
We have been called that by many; not just our heads
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
but that our minds are so diversely colored: and
really, I think if all our minds came out of
a skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
and their consent in a direct manner should be to
once at all points of the compass.

Second citizen:
Do you think so? How do you judge my mind
fly?

Third citizen:
No, your mind will not express itself as quickly as another man's.
will;'tis heavily stuck in a block head, but
if he were free, he would, of course, head south.

Second citizen:
Why this way?

Third citizen:
Getting lost in a fog, where being three parts
melted in the rotten dews, the fourth would return
for the sake of conscience, to help you find a wife.

Second citizen:
You are never without tips: you can, you can.

Third citizen:
Are you all determined to give your voice? But
it doesn't matter, most wear it. I
let's say, if he wanted to bow to the people, there would be
never a more worthy man.
Here he comes, and in the robe of humility: notice his
behavior. We don't all have to stay together, but
come near him where he is, one or two, and
by three. He must make his requests by
details; in which each of us has a single
honor, giving it our own voices with our own
tongues: follow me then, and I will direct you how
you will pass through him.

All:
Content, content.

MENNIUS:
O sir, you are not right: do you not know
The most worthy men have not done it?

CORIOLANUS:
What should I say ?
“Please, sir” - The plague is here! I can't bring
My tongue moves like this: “Look, sir, at my wounds!
I put them at the service of my country, when
Some of your brothers roared and ran
From the sound of our own drums.

MENNIUS:
O me, the gods!
We must not talk about that: we must desire them
To think of you.

CORIOLANUS:
Think of me ! hang them!
I would like them to forget me, like the virtues
What our theologians lose because of them.

MENNIUS:
You will ruin everything:
I'm leaving you: please, speak to them, please,
In a healthy way.

CORIOLANUS:
Ask them to wash their face
And keep their teeth clean.
So here's a splint.
You know the reason, air, for my presence here.

Third citizen:
We do, sir; tell us what brought you to this.

CORIOLANUS:
My own desert.

Second citizen:
Your own desert!

CORIOLANUS:
Yes, but not my own desire.

Third citizen:
What do you mean it's not your own desire?

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir, I never wanted to disturb the
poor in begging.

Third citizen:
You must think that if we give you something, we hope
win by you.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, please, your price for the consulate?

First citizen:
The price is to be asked kindly.

CORIOLANUS:
Kindly! Sir, please let me do it: I have wounds on my
show you what will be yours in private. Your
good voice, sir; what you say?

Second citizen:
You will have it, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS:
A match, sir. There are two worthy voices in all
begged. I have your alms: goodbye.

Third citizen:
But it's something strange.

Second citizen:
It would be possible to give back, but it doesn't matter.

CORIOLANUS:
Do you pray now, if it will keep pace with your
vote for me to be consul, I have here the
usual dress.

Fourth citizen:
You have nobly deserved of your country, and you
I have not nobly deserved.

CORIOLANUS:
Your enigma?

Fourth citizen:
You have been a scourge to his enemies, you have
she was a rod for her friends; you really didn't like it
ordinary people.

CORIOLANUS:
You should consider me all the more virtuous because I have
This has not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
sworn brother, the people, to win a dearer
their estimate; this is a condition they take into account
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
rather to have my hat than my heart, I will train
the insinuating nod and it is towards them that I go the most
counterfeiting; that is to say, sir, I will counterfeit the
bewitch a popular man and give it away
generous to those who wish. Therefore, I beg you,
Perhaps I will be consul.

Fifth citizen:
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
you our voices warmly.

Fourth citizen:
You have received many wounds for your country.

CORIOLANUS:
I will not seal your knowledge by showing it. I
will make much of your voices and will not disturb you further.

The two citizens:
The gods give you joy, sir, with a good heart!

CORIOLANUS:
Very sweet voices!
Better to die, better to starve,
Than wanting the hiring we deserve first.
Why in this woolen outfit should I stay here,
To beg Hob and Dick it appears,
Their useless guarantors? Custom calls me for this:
As custom dictates, should we not do in all things,
The dust of ancient times would remain intact,
And the mountainous errors are too numerous
So that the truth is superior to its peers. Rather than deceive him like this,
Let's drop high office and honor
To the one who would do so. I'm halfway through;
One party suffered, the other I will.
Here are other voices.
Your voices: for your voices I fought;
Watch your voices; because your voices carry
Injuries, around twenty; fights three times six
I saw and heard; because your voices have
I've done a lot of things, some less, some more with your voices:
Indeed, I would be consul.

Sixth citizen:
He has done nobly and cannot do without honest
man's voice.

Seventh citizen:
Let him therefore be consul: the gods give him joy,
and make him a good friend of the people!

All citizens:
Amen, amen. God save you, noble consul!

CORIOLANUS:
Dignified voices!

MENNIUS:
You have resisted your limits; and the tribunes
Give yourself the voice of the people: stay
That, in the official marks invested, you
I will meet with the Senate soon.

CORIOLANUS:
Is it done?

SICINIUS:
The request custom you discharged:
People admit you and are summoned
To meet soon, after your approval.

CORIOLANUS:
Or? in the Senate?

SICINIUS:
There, Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS:
Can I change these clothes?

SICINIUS:
You can, sir.

CORIOLANUS:
This is what I am going to do directly; and, knowing myself again,
Repair at Senate House.

MENNIUS:
I'll keep you company. Would you like to accompany me?

BRUTUS:
We stay here for the people.

SICINIUS:
Be well.
He has it now, and from the looks of it I think
It warms the heart.

BRUTUS:
With a proud heart he carried his humble herbs.
will you send the people away?

SICINIUS:
Well, my masters! did you choose this man?

First citizen:
He has our votes, sir.

BRUTUS:
We pray to the gods that he deserves your loves.

Second citizen:
Amen, sir: in my poor unworthy opinion,
He mocked us when he begged for our voices.

Third citizen:
Certainly
He totally flouted us.

First citizen:
No, that's his kind of speech: he didn't make fun of us.

Second citizen:
Not one of us, run away, but said
He used us with contempt: he should have shown us
His marks of merit, his wounds received for the homeland.

SICINIUS:
Well, that's what he did, I'm sure.

Citizens:
No no; no one saw them.

Third citizen:
He said he had injuries he could show
in private;
And with his hat, waving it thus with contempt,
“I would be consul,” he said: “old custom,
But by your voices, do not allow me;
So your voices. When we granted this,
Here's 'Thank you for your votes: thank you:
Your sweetest voices: now you're gone
your voices,
I don't have any more with you. Wasn't that a mockery?

SICINIUS:
Why did you ignore this,
Or, seeing him, such childish kindness
To give up your votes?

BRUTUS:
You couldn't have told him
As you were taught, when he had no power,
But he was a small servant of the state,
He was your enemy, he always spoke against
Your freedoms and the charters you carry
I am the body of good; and now I'm coming
A place of power and influence over the state,
If he still had to stay smart
Fast enemy of the plebs, your voices could
Are you curses? You should have said
That his meritorious acts demanded no less
That what he represented, therefore his gracious nature
I would think of you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Stand up, your friendly lord.

SICINIUS:
So for having said,
As you were warned, you had touched his mind
And he tried his inclination; torn from him
Be his gracious promise, what ye might,
As the cause called you, I held it
Or else it would have irritated his surly nature,
Which easily supports any item
Attach it to anything; therefore making him angry,
You should have taken advantage of his anger
And he passed it without being elected.

BRUTUS:
Did you perceive
He solicited you with wanton contempt
When he needed your loves, and do you think
So that his contempt does not bruise you,
When does it have the power to crush? Why, were your bodies
No heart among you? or you had tongues to cry
Against the rectorate of judgment?

SICINIUS:
Have you got
Has the applicant now been refused? and now again
From him who did not ask, but scoffed, grant
Your languages pursued?

Third citizen:
It is not confirmed; we can still refuse it.

Second citizen:
And will refuse him:
I will have five hundred votes of this sound.

First citizen:
I have two times five hundred and their friends to tear them to pieces.

BRUTUS:
Leave immediately and tell these friends,
They have chosen a consul who will take them
Their freedoms; give them more voice
Than dogs who are also often beaten for barking
This is why we wanted to do it.

SICINIUS:
Let them gather,
And on a sounder judgment, revoke all
Your ignorant election; strengthen his pride,
And his old hatred towards you; Besides, don't forget
With what contempt he bore the humble grass,
How he despised you in his costume; but your loves,
Thinking of his services, I took you
The apprehension of its current bearing,
What he shaped in the most mocking and serious way
After the inveterate hatred he has for you.

BRUTUS:
To set down
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we worked,
No obstacle enters, but this you must
Cast your election on him.

SICINIUS:
Say, you chose it
More as we command than as guided
By your own true affections, and by your mind,
Concerned about what you should do instead
That what you should, I did to you against the grain
To tell him consul: blame us.

BRUTUS:
Yes, don't spare us. Let's say we read lectures to you.
With what youth he began to serve his country,
How long did it last and what stock did it come from,
The noble house of the Marcians, from which came
This Ancus Marcius, the son of Numa's daughter,
Who, after the great Hostilius, was here king;
Of the same house were Publius and Quintus,
That our beaten water brought by pipes here;
And
Be twice
Was his great ancestor.

SICINIUS:
We went down like this,
who worked very well in his person
To be established, we congratulated
To your memories: but you found,
Evolving its current orientation with its past,
That he is your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your sudden approval.

BRUTUS:
Say, you've never done that...
Harp it again, but putting it in place;
And later, when you have drawn your number,
Repair at the Capitol.

All:
We will: almost all
Repent in their election.

BRUTUS:
Let them continue;
It would be better to put this mutiny in danger,
Than to stay, without a doubt, for better:
If, as his nature is, he falls with rage
With their refusal, both observe and respond
The point of view of his anger.

SICINIUS:
At the Capitol, come:
We will be there before the flood of people;
And it will seem, in part, to be theirs,
Which we took further.

CORIOLANUS:
Had Tullus Aufidius made a new leader then?

LARTIUS:
He had done it, my lord; and that is what caused
Our composition faster.

CORIOLANUS:
So the Volscians stand but as at the beginning,
Ready, when the weather prompts them, to hit the road.
It's all over again.

COMINIUS:
They are worn out, lord consul, so,
That we will barely see in our ages
Their banners are flying again.

CORIOLANUS:
Have you seen Aufidius?

LARTIUS:
Safely he came to me; and I cursed
Against the Volscians, because they had so wickedly
Cedes the city: he withdraws to Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
Did he talk about me?

LARTIUS:
He did it, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
How? What ?

LARTIUS:
How many times he had met you, sword to sword;
The one of all things on earth that he hated
Your most person, that he would pawn his fortune
To desperate restitution, so that he can
Be called your conqueror.

CORIOLANUS:
Does he live in Antium?

LARTIUS:
In Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
I wish I had a reason to look for him there,
To fully oppose his hatred. Welcome to the house.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues of the common mouth: I despise them;
Because they play pranks on them with authority,
Against all noble suffering.

SICINIUS:
Don't go any further.

CORIOLANUS:
Ha! what is this?

BRUTUS:
It would be dangerous to continue: no further.

CORIOLANUS:
What makes this change?

MENNIUS:
The question?

COMINIUS:
Has he not gone beyond the noble and the common?

BRUTUS:
Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS:
Did I have children's voices?

First senator:
Tribunes, give way; he will go to the market.

BRUTUS:
The people are furious with him.

SICINIUS:
Stop,
Or everything will come crashing down.

CORIOLANUS:
Is this your herd?
Should they have votes, who can yield them now
And deny their language? What are
your offices?
You being their mouth, why don't you control their teeth?
Didn't you put them on?

MENNIUS:
Be calm, be calm.

CORIOLANUS:
It's an intentional thing, and it grows piecemeal,
To curb the will of the nobility:
Suffer and live with those who cannot rule
Nor will it ever be governed.

BRUTUS:
This is not a conspiracy:
People are screaming that you made fun of them, and lately,
When we gave them free wheat, you lamented;
I scandalized the supplicants of the people, I called them
Those who love time, the flatterers, the enemies of the nobility.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, that was known before.

BRUTUS:
Not to everyone.

CORIOLANUS:
Did you inform them immediately?

BRUTUS:
How! I inform them!

CORIOLANUS:
You like doing such deals.

BRUTUS:
Not unlike,
In every way, to improve yours.

CORIOLANUS:
Why then should I be consul? Beyond the clouds,
Let me deserve as much pain as you and make me
Your fellow tribune.

SICINIUS:
You show too much
What people are agitating for: if you pass
Where you are destined, you must learn your way,
From which you emerged, with a gentler spirit,
Or never be as noble as a consul,
Nor a yoke with him as a platform.

MENNIUS:
Let's be calm.

COMINIUS:
People are mistreated; started. This desolate
Not suitable for Rome, and neither is Coriolanus
I deserved this rub so dishonored, falsely posed
I clearly recognize its merit.

CORIOLANUS:
Tell me about corn!
It was my speech, and I will speak no more...

MENNIUS:
Not now, not now.

First senator:
Not in this heat, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS:
Now, as I live, I will. My noblest friends,
I beg their forgiveness:
For the many mutable and fragrant, let them
Consider me as I do not flatter, and
This is where they see each other: I repeat,
By appeasing them, we feed against our senate
The hull of rebellion, of insolence, of sedition,
For which we ourselves plowed and sowed,
and scattered,
By mixing them with us, the honored number,
Who lacks neither virtue nor power, but that
Which they gave to beggars.

MENNIUS:
Well, no more.

First senator:
No more words, we beg you.

CORIOLANUS:
How! no more!
As for my country, I have shed my blood,
I'm not afraid of external force, so are my lungs
Invent words until they decompose against this measles,
What we disdain should tear us apart, but sought
The very way to catch them.

BRUTUS:
You are talking about the people,
As if you were a god to punish, not
A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS:
"Everything was fine
We let people know.

MENNIUS:
What what? his anger ?

CORIOLANUS:
Anger!
Was I as patient as midnight sleep,
By Jupiter, that would be my spirit!

SICINIUS:
It's a spirit
It will remain a poison where it is,
Stop poisoning.

CORIOLANUS:
Will stay!
Do you hear that Minnow Triton? mark yourself
His absolute “must”?

COMINIUS:
It was canon.

CORIOLANUS:
'Duty'!
O good but very imprudent patricians! Why,
You, serious but imprudent senators, have you thus
Since Hydra is here to choose an officer,
That with its peremptory “must”, being only
The monster's horn and noise don't want no mind
To say that it will turn your current into a ditch,
And make your channel their own? If he has the power
So boast of your ignorance; if there is none, wake up
Your dangerous clemency. If you are educated,
Do not be like simple fools; if you are not,
Give them cushions at your disposal. You are plebeians,
If they are senators: and they are no less,
When your two voices mixed, the best taste
Most of the palaces are theirs. They choose their magistrate,
And someone like him, who puts his "must",
His popular “must” against a more serious bench
Never frown in Greece. By Jupiter himself!
This demeans the consuls: and my soul suffers
Namely, when two authorities are in place,
Nor supreme, how long the confusion
Can enter between the gap of the two and take
One by the other.

COMINIUS:
Well, let's head to the market.

CORIOLANUS:
Whoever gave this advice, to give
Corn from the warehouse is free, as it was used
Some time in Greece,...

MENNIUS:
Well, none of that anymore.

CORIOLANUS:
Even if there the people had more absolute power,
I say, they fed disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state.

BRUTUS:
Why, will people give
He who speaks his voice like this?

CORIOLANUS:
I will give my reasons,
More worthy than their voices. They know corn
Wasn't that our reward, being well assured
Who has never done service for this: being in a hurry to go to war,
Even when the navel of the State was touched,
They didn't want to go through the doors. This kind of service
I didn't deserve free corn. Being me the war
Their mutinies and revolts, in which they showed
Very valiant, he did not speak for them: the accusation
What they often did against the Senate,
All causes unborn could never be the motive
Of our so frank gift. Well, so what?
How will this multitude of bison digest
Courtesy of the Senate? Let the actions speak
What their words sound like: “We asked for it; »
We're the biggest poll, and in real fear
They told us about our demands. Thus we degrade
The nature of our seats and being a scoundrel
Call our worries fears; who with time
Break the locks of the Senate and bring in
The crows peck the eagles.

MENNIUS:
Come on, that's enough.

BRUTUS:
Enough, with excessive measures.

CORIOLANUS:
No, take more:
That by which one may swear, both divine and human,
Seal what I end with! This double worship,
Where one party rightly disdains, the other
Insult without any reason, where nobility, title, wisdom,
I can only conclude yes and no
From general ignorance it is necessary to omit
Real necessities, and yield time
To unstable lightness: goal so forbidden,
it follows,
Nothing is done on purpose. Therefore, please...
You who will be less fearful than discreet,
Who loves the fundamental part of the state
More than you doubt change, you prefer
A noble life before long, and I wish
Jumping a physically dangerous body
It's sure to die without it, tear it off immediately
The innumerable language; that they do not lick
The sweet that is their poison: your dishonor
Mutilates the true judgment and puts the State into mourning
Of this integrity which should become,
Not having the power to do the good he would like,
For the one who is not in control.

BRUTUS:
Enough said.

SICINIUS:
Spoke like a traitor and will answer
Like traitors do.

CORIOLANUS:
Miserable, even if you are overwhelmed!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
On whom depends their obedience fails
To the largest bench: in a rebellion,
When that which is not in conformity, but that which must be, was the law,
Then were they chosen: at a better hour,
Let what is proper be said, it must be said,
And throw their power into the dust.

BRUTUS:
Clear betrayal!

SICINIUS:
Is he a consul? No.

BRUTUS:
The city councilors, ho!
Let him be apprehended.

SICINIUS:
Come on, call people:
in whose name myself
Strap yourself in like a treacherous innovator,
Enemy of the public good: obey, I order you,
And follow your answer.

CORIOLANUS:
So, old goat!

Senators, &C:
We will guarantee it.

COMINIUS:
Elderly gentleman, don't touch.

CORIOLANUS:
So, rotten thing! or I will shake your bones
Out of your clothes.

SICINIUS:
Help, citizens!

MENNIUS:
More respect on both sides.

SICINIUS:
Here is the one who would take away all your power.

BRUTUS:
Grab it, AEdiles!

Citizens:
Down with him! down with him!

Senators, &C:
Weapons, weapons, weapons!
“Tribunes!” “Patricians!” " 'Citizens!' “What, ho!”
“Sicinius!” “Brutus!” » “Coriolanus!” " 'Citizens!'
“Peace, peace, peace!” » “Stay, stay, peace!” »

MENNIUS:
What's going to happen ? I am out of breath;
Confusion is near; I can not talk. You, tribunes
To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius.

SICINIUS:
Listen to me, my friends; peace!

Citizens:
Let us listen to our platform: peace Speak, speak, speak.

SICINIUS:
You are about to lose your freedoms:
Marcius would want everything from you; Marcius,
Whom you recently appointed consul.

MENNIUS:
Fi, fi, fi!
This is the way to turn on, not off.

First senator:
Deconstruct the city and make it completely flat.

SICINIUS:
What is the city if not the people?

Citizens:
TRUE,
The people are the city.

BRUTUS:
By the consent of all, we were established
The people's magistrates.

Citizens:
You stay like that.

MENNIUS:
And that's what we love to do.

COMINIUS:
This is how you make the city flat;
To bring the roof to the foundations,
And bury everything that nevertheless extends distinctly,
In piles and piles of ruins.

SICINIUS:
This deserves death.

BRUTUS:
Or let's defend our authority,
Or let's lose it. We pronounce here,
On the part of the people, in whose power
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy of it
Of actual death.

SICINIUS:
Seize it then;
Carry it to the Tarpeian rock, and from there
Throw it into destruction.

BRUTUS:
Adiles, grab it!

Citizens:
Give in, Marcius, give in!

MENNIUS:
Listen to me a word;
I beg you, tribunes, just listen to me one word.

AEdile:
Peace, peace!

MENNIUS:

BRUTUS:
Sir, these cold manners,
It seems like prudent help, but it's very toxic
Where the disease is violent. lay your hands on him,
And carry him to the rock.

CORIOLANUS:
No, I'm going to die here.
There are some of you who have seen me fight:
Come, try for yourselves what you saw in me.

MENNIUS:
Down with this sword! Tribunes, step aside for a moment.

BRUTUS:
Lay your hands on him.

COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You who are noble; help him, young and old!

Citizens:
Down with him, down with him!

MENNIUS:
Go, take you home; go, go!
Everything will be nothing else.

Second senator:
Go away.

COMINIUS:
Stand firm;
We have as many friends as enemies.

MENNIUS:
Shame, can this be put to this?

First senator:
Gods forbid!
Please, noble friend, go home;
Let us cure this cause.

MENNIUS:
Because it is a plague for us,
You cannot settle in a tent: leave, I beg you.

COMINIUS:
Come, sir, with us.

CORIOLANUS:
I wish they were barbaric, as they are,
Although in Rome there are trash, not Romans, as they are not,
Although calved under the porch of the Capitol...

MENNIUS:
Go;
Do not put your worthy anger in your tongue;
Once will have to be another.

CORIOLANUS:
On a showground
I could beat forty.

COMINIUS:
I could myself
Grab a pair of the best of them; Yes the
two stands:
But now the odds are beyond arithmetic;
And manhood is called madness, when it stands
Against falling fabric. So do you want,
Before the return of the tag? whose rage tears
Like broken waters and an o'erbear
What they are used to.

MENNIUS:
Please go:
I'll try if my old mind is asked
With those who have little: this must be corrected
With fabric of any color.

COMINIUS:
No, leave.

A Patrician:
This man wasted his fortune.

MENNIUS:
His nature is too noble for the world:
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
Or Jupiter for the power of thunder. His heart is his mouth:
What his chest forges, what his tongue must express;
And, being angry, he forgets that ever
He heard the name of death.
This is good work!

Second Patrician:
I wish they were in bed!

MENNIUS:
I wish they were at the Tiber! What revenge!
Couldn't he speak to them fairly?

SICINIUS:
Where is this viper
This would depopulate the city and
To be everyone themselves?

MENNIUS:
You, worthy tribunes,

SICINIUS:
He will be thrown on the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands: he resisted the law,
And that's why the law will hold him in contempt for a new trial
That the severity of public power
Which he thus brings to nothing.

First citizen:
He will know well
The noble tribunes are the mouth of the people,
And we their hands.

Citizens:
He will, of course.

MENNIUS:
Sir Sir,...

SICINIUS:
Peace!

MENNIUS:
Don't cry chaos, where you should but chase
With a modest mandate.

SICINIUS:
Sir, how come you
Do you have any help with this rescue?

MENNIUS:
Listen to me speak:
As I know the value of the consul,
So may I name its faults,--

SICINIUS:
Consul! which consul?

MENNIUS:
Consul Coriolanus.

BRUTUS:
He consul!

Citizens:
No no no no no.

MENNIUS:
If, with the permission of the tribunes and yours, good people,
I can be heard, I would like a word or two;
What won't hurt you anymore
What a waste of time.

SICINIUS:
So speak briefly;
Because we are peremptory to ship
This traitorous viper: to chase him from here
Were just a danger, and keeping him here
Our certain death: this is why it is decreed
He dies that night.

MENNIUS:
Now the good gods forbid us
May our famous Rome, whose gratitude
Towards his deserved children is registered
In Jupiter's own book, like an unnatural dam
He should eat his now!

SICINIUS:
It is a disease that must be eradicated.

MENNIUS:
Oh, it's a member who has only one illness;
Mortal, to cut it; To fix it, it's easy.
What did he do in Rome that deserves death?
Killing our enemies, the blood he lost...
Which, I dare guarantee, is more than he has,
By many ounces… he gave it up for his country;
And what remains, to lose him by his country,
If it were for all of us, who don't do it and suffer it,
A brand to the ends of the earth.

SICINIUS:
It's clean Kam.

BRUTUS:
Simply wrong: when he loved his country,
It honored him.

MENNIUS:
The foot service
Being once gangrenous is no longer respected
What it was for before.

BRUTUS:
We won't hear any more.
Pursue him to his house, and snatch him from there:
Lest his infection, being contagious in nature,
Spread more.

MENNIUS:
One more word, one word.
This tiger-footed rage, when he finds
The harm of unanalyzed speed will arrive too late
Attach pounds of lead to your heels. Proceed by process;
Lest feasts, as he is beloved, break out,
And sack great Rome with the Romans.

BRUTUS:
If it were so,...

SICINIUS:
What are you talking about ?
Have we not tasted his obedience?
Our councilors knocked? We ourselves resisted? Come.

MENNIUS:
Consider this: he was raised in wars
Since he knows how to draw a sword and he is poorly educated
In bolted language; meal and its whole
He throws indiscriminately. Give me leave,
I will go to him and commit to bringing him
Where he will respond, in a legal form,
In peace, at his greatest risk.

First senator:
Noble tribunes,
This is the human way: the other way
It will turn out to be too bloody, and the end
Unknown at first.

SICINIUS:
Noble Menenius,
So be yourself as an officer of the people.
Masters, lay down your arms.

BRUTUS:
Don't go home.

SICINIUS:
Go to the market square. We will be waiting for you there:
Where, if you don't bring Marcius, we will continue
In our first way.

MENNIUS:
I'll bring it to you.
Let me long for your company: he must come,
Or worse will follow.

First senator:
Please, let's go to him.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them blow around my ears, introduce me
Death while driving or following wild horses,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
That the precipitation could spread
Under the beam of sight, but will I always
Be that way towards them.

A Patrician:
You do the noblest thing.

CORIOLANUS:
I think of my mother
Don't approve of me anymore, that was the habit
To call them vassals of wool, created things
Buy and sell with gruel, show bare head
In congregations, to yawn, stand still and marvel,
When only one of my orders stood
Talk about peace or war.
I'm talking about you :
Why did you wish me more gentleness? Do you want to have me
False in relation to my nature? Say instead that I play
The man that I am.

VOLUMNIA:
O, sir, sir, sir,
I would have asked you to put your power to good use,
Before having worn it out.

CORIOLANUS:
Let go.

VOLUMNIA:
Maybe you would have been enough of the man you are,
By trying less to be; less had been
The contradictions of your arrangements, if
You hadn't shown them how willing you were
Before, they lacked the power to upset you.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them hang.

A Patrician:
Yes, and burns too.

MENNIUS:
Come on, come on, you were too hard, something
too hard;
You have to come back and fix it.

First senator:
There is no cure;
Unless, in doing so, our good city
Split down the middle and perish.

VOLUMNIA:
Pray, be advised:
I have a heart as unfit as yours,
But yet a brain that directs my use of anger
For a better view.

MENNIUS:
Well said, noble woman?
Before he should thus lower himself towards the herd, but this
The violent crisis of time demands it as physical
For the whole state I would put on my armor,
Which I can barely stand.

CORIOLANUS:
What should I do?

MENNIUS:
Return to the stands.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, so what? so what ?

MENNIUS:
Repent of what you have said.

CORIOLANUS:
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Should I then do nothing to them?

VOLUMNIA:
You are too absolute;
Although one can never be too noble,
But when the extremities speak. I heard you say,
Honor and politics, like inseparable friends,
The war grows together: grant it and tell me,
In peace what each of them loses the other,
Let them not combine there.

CORIOLANUS:
Shh, shh!

MENNIUS:
A good request.

VOLUMNIA:
If it is an honor in your wars to appear
You are not the same, which for your best interests,
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
That he will keep company in peace
With honor, as in war, since for both
Is it like a request?

CORIOLANUS:
Why force yourself into this?

VOLUMNIA:
Because now it's your turn to speak
To the people; not by your own instruction,
Nor by the things that your heart urges you,
But with such words that are only rooted in
Your language, however, but bastards and syllables
Without considering the truth of your breast.
Now it doesn't dishonor you at all
Than to visit a city with sweet words,
What else would put you to your fortune and
The danger of a lot of blood.
I would hide with my nature where
My fortune and friends at stake required
I should do it with honor: I am here,
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
And you will rather show our general thugs
How can you frown rather than devote a fawn to them,
For the inheritance of their loves and their preservation
Of what this desire could ruin.

MENNIUS:
Noble lady!
Come, come with us; speak honestly: you can save him,
It is not the present that is dangerous, but the loss
Of what happened.

VOLUMNIA:
I beg you now, my son,
Go towards them, with this cap in your hand;
And having extended it thus far, behold with them…
Your knee crushes stones - because in such matters
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
More educated than the ears, shaking the head,
Who often, thus correcting your valiant heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
This will not hold the manipulation: nor will it tell them,
You're their soldier, and you're raised on grills
Don't you have the gentleness with which, you admit,
Are they worthy of being used as they claim,
By asking for their good loves, but you will frame
Yourself, in truth, now theirs, until now
How powerful and personable you are.

MENNIUS:
This but it is done,
Even as she speaks, well, their heart was yours;
Because they have forgiveness, requested, also free
Like useless words.

VOLUMNIA:
I beg you now,
Go and let yourself be governed: even though I know you would prefer
Follow your enemy into a fiery gulf
Than petting him in a cradle. This is Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I've been in the market; and, sir, it's okay
You make a strong party, or you defend yourself
By calm or by its absence: everything is angry.

MENNIUS:
Just fair speech.

COMINIUS:
I think it will be useful, if
Can thus frame his mind.

VOLUMNIA:
He must and he will
Please say it and go.

CORIOLANUS:
Should I go show them my barbless sconce?
Shall I, with a low tongue, give my noble heart
A lie he has to put up with? Well, I won't do:
Yet if there was only one plot to lose,
This mold of Marcius, they should grind it to dust
And throw it against the wind. At the market !
You have put me now in a role like never before
I will discharge to life.

COMINIUS:
Come, come, we will invite you.

VOLUMNIA:
Please now, sweet son, as you said
My praises made you a soldier first, so,
To get my praise for this, play a game
You've never done it before.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, I must not do:
Get away from my disposal and possess me
The spirit of a prostitute! my throat of war be turned,
Who sang with my drum, in a pipe
Small like a eunuch or a virgin voice
Let the babies go to sleep! the smiles of the rascals
Tent on my cheeks, and the tears of schoolchildren begin again
The glasses of my vision! the tongue of a beggar
Make movement through my lips and my armored knees,
Who only bowed in my stirrup, bends like his
This one received a handout! I will not do it,
Lest I stop honoring my own truth
And by the action of my body, teach my mind
A most inherent baseness.

VOLUMNIA:
Your choice, then:
Begging you is my greatest dishonor
Than you of them. Come all to ruin; to leave 
Your mother would rather feel your pride than your fear
Your dangerous corpulence, because I don't care about death
With a heart as big as you. Do what you say
Your valor was mine, you sucked it from me,
But you owe your pride to yourself.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray, be happy:
Mother, I am going to the market;
Don't scold me anymore. I will ridicule their loves,
Take away their hearts and come home beloved
Of all the trades in Rome. Listen, I'll:
Recommend me to my wife. I will return consul;
Or never trust what my tongue can do
I'm further down the flattery route.

VOLUMNIA:
Do your will.

COMINIUS:
Far! the tribunes assist you: arm yourself
To respond gently; because they are prepared
With accusations, as I hear it, stronger
Which is still on you.

CORIOLANUS:
The word is “slightly.” Please, let's go:
Let them accuse me of invention, I
I will answer in my honor.

MENNIUS:
Yes, but slowly.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, be gentle, then. Gently!

BRUTUS:
On this point, charge him at home, which he affects
Tyrannical power: if it escapes us there,
Strengthen him with his envy towards the people,
And the spoils fell on the Antiates
Was never distributed.
What, will he come?

AEdile:
He is coming.

BRUTUS:
How to accompany?

AEdile:
With old Menenius and these senators
This has always favored him.

SICINIUS:
Do you have a catalog
Of all the voices we've provided
Filed by the ballot?

AEdile:
I have; It's ready.

SICINIUS:
Did you collect them by tribe?

AEdile:
I have.

SICINIUS:
Now gather the people here;
And when they carry me they say "It will be so
I am the right and the strength of the commons, whether
For death, for fine or for banishment, then let them
If I say good, shout “Good”; if it's death, shout "Death."
Insist on the ancient prerogative
And power is the truth about the cause.

AEdile:
I will inform them.

BRUTUS:
And when they start to cry,
Let them not stop, but with a confused din
Apply this execution
Of what we have the chance to condemn.

AEdile:
Alright.

SICINIUS:
Make them be strong and ready to receive this hint,
When we can give them to them.

BRUTUS:
Go for it.
Make him angry directly: he was used
Always conquer and have your value
Of contradiction: being irritated, he can no longer
Be subject again to temperance; then he speaks
What is in his heart? and that's what looks like
It's up to us to break his neck.

SICINIUS:
Well, here it is.

MENNIUS:
Calmly, I beg you.

CORIOLANUS:
Yes, as a groom, it's for the poorest piece
Will support the valet by volume. The gods honored
Keep Rome safe and the seats of justice
Provided with worthy men! plant love among the!
Gather our great temples with the spectacles of peace,
And not our streets at war!

First senator:
Amen, amen.

MENNIUS:
A noble wish.

SICINIUS:
Come closer, you people.

AEdile:
Make the list to your tribunes. Audience: Peace, I say!

CORIOLANUS:
First, listen to me speak.

The two Tribunes:
We'll say. Peace, ho!

CORIOLANUS:
Will I not be charged beyond this gift?
Does everyone have to decide here?

SICINIUS:
I demand,
If you submit to the voice of the people,
Allow their officers and are satisfied
Suffering legal censorship for such mistakes
Will this be proven to you?

CORIOLANUS:
I am happy.

MENNIUS:
Here, citizens, he says he is happy:
Consider the warlike service he rendered; think
On the wounds that his body bears, which show
Like graves in the sacred cemetery.

CORIOLANUS:
Stripes with brambles,
Scars to move laughter only.

MENNIUS:
Consider further,
That when he doesn't speak like a citizen,
You find him like a soldier: don't take
His harsher accents for malevolent sounds,
But, as I said, he who becomes a soldier,
Rather than envying you.

COMINIUS:
Well, no more.

CORIOLANUS:
What is the problem
This being passed for consul in full voice,
I am so disgraced that right now
Are you taking it off again?

SICINIUS:
Answer us.

CORIOLANUS:
So say: it's true, I should.

SICINIUS:
We accuse you of having succeeded in taking
From Rome to the office in all seasons and in the wind
Yourself in tyrannical power;
For which you are a traitor to the people.

CORIOLANUS:
How! traitor!

MENNIUS:
No, in moderation; your promise.

CORIOLANUS:
Fires are the lowest hell and bring people together!
Call me their traitor! You, insulting tribune!
In your eyes were twenty thousand dead,
In your hand I held as many millions, in
Your lying tongue the two digits, I would say
"You're lying to yourself" in such a free voice
As I pray to the gods.

SICINIUS:
Do you notice that, friends?

Citizens:
To the rock, to the rock with him!

SICINIUS:
Peace!
We do not need to entrust him with a new matter:
What you saw him do and heard about,
Beat your officers, curse you,
Oppose the laws with strokes and here defy them
Those whose great power must experience it; even that,
So criminal and so capital,
Deserves the most extreme death.

BRUTUS:
But since he has
Served well in Rome,--

CORIOLANUS:
What do you do as a service?

BRUTUS:
I'm talking about that, you know it.

CORIOLANUS:
You?

MENNIUS:
Is this the promise you made to your mother?

COMINIUS:
Know, please,--

CORIOLANUS:
I do not know more :
Let them pronounce abrupt Tarpeian death,
Exile wanderer, radiant, cut off to linger
But with a grain a day, I wouldn't buy
Their mercy at the price of a just word;
Nor test my courage for what they can give,
You should not say “Hello”.

SICINIUS:
For this he has,
As much as it resides in him, from time to time
Envious against the people, looking for ways
To take away their power, like now at last
Given hostile blows, and that not in the presence
Of the feared justice, but on the ministers
This distributes it; in the name of the people
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
From this moment on, ban him from our city,
In danger of precipitation
From the Tarpeian rock, never again
To enter our gates of Rome: this is the name of the people,
I say it will be so.

Citizens:
It will be so, it will be so; let him go:
He is banished, and so it will be.

COMINIUS:
Listen to me, my masters and my mutual friends,

SICINIUS:
He is condemned; more hearing.

COMINIUS:
Let me talk:
I was consul and I can present myself in Rome
The marks of his enemies on me. I really like
My country is good with a tenderer respect,
Holier and deeper than my own life,
The estimation of my dear wife, the increase of her belly,
And the treasure of my loins; so if i would
Speak that...

SICINIUS:
We know your drift: talk what?

BRUTUS:
There's nothing left to say, but he's banished,
As an enemy of the people and his country:
It will be so.

Citizens:
It will be so, it will be so.

CORIOLANUS:
You common cry of priests! whose breath I hate
Like the smell of rotten swamps, whose loves I appreciate
Like the dead carcasses of unburied men
He who corrupts my air, I banish you;
And stay here with your uncertainty!
Let every faint rumor shake your hearts!
Your enemies, nodding their feathers,
Tackle despair! I still have the power
To banish your defenders; until finally
Your ignorance, which only finds when it feels,
Make no reservations about yourselves,
Always your own enemies, deliver yourself like most
Captives slaughtered in a nation
This has won you without blows! Contemptuous,
To you, the city, I therefore turn my back:
There is a world elsewhere.

AEdile:
The enemy of the people is gone, he is gone!

Citizens:
Our enemy is banished! he left! Whoa! hoo!

SICINIUS:
Go to him at the gates and follow him,
As he followed you, despite everything;
Give him some deserved vexation. Leave a guard
Join us across town.

Citizens:
Come come; let us see him at the gates; come.
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.

CORIOLANUS:
Come leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
With several heads, it cuts me. No mother,
Where is your old courage? you were used
To say that the extremity was the judge of spirits;
These common chances that ordinary men could bear;
That when the sea was calm, all boats were the same
Demonstrated mastery in floating; strokes of fortune,
When most hit home, being slightly injured, they yearn
A noble ruse: you used to charge me
With precepts that would make you invincible
The heart that deceived them.

VIRGILIA:
O heaven! O heaven!

CORIOLANUS:
No! I beg you, woman,...

VOLUMNIA:
Now the red plague hits all trades in Rome,
And the professions are perishing!

CORIOLANUS:
What what what!
I will be loved when I am missed. No mother.
Take back this spirit, when you said:
If you had been Hercules' wife,
You would have done six of his works and saved
Your husband is sweating so much. Cominius,
Don't slouch; Farewell. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
I'll be fine again. You, old and true Menenius,
Your tears are saltier than those of a younger man,
And poisonous in your eyes. My former general,
I saw you born, and you often saw
Breathtaking glasses; tell these sad women
I like to moan from the inevitable blows,
Because you have to make fun of them. My mother, you are fine
My dangers have always been your comfort: and
Don't take it lightly, even if I go alone,
Like a solitary dragon, that its swamp
Fears and speaks of more than what we have seen - your son
Will or will exceed average or will be caught
With careful baiting and practice.

VOLUMNIA:
My first son.
Where will you go ? Take good Cominius
With you for a while: determine a direction,
More than wild exposure at every chance
It starts like before you.

CORIOLANUS:
Oh the gods!

COMINIUS:
I will follow you for a month, I will design with you
Where you will rest, so you can hear about us
And we of you: so if time is short
A cause for your repeal we will not send
O'er the wide world to seek one man,
And lose the advantage, which is always cool
I' the absence of the needy.

CORIOLANUS:
Farewell :
You have years ahead of you; and you're too full
From the excesses of war, to go on a trip with a
It's still unharmed: bring me but to the door.
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
My friends of noble touch, when I go out,
Say goodbye and smile. Please come.
While I stay above ground, you'll have to
Listen to me again, and never anything from me
But what was once like me?

MENNIUS:
It's worthy
As any ear can hear it. Come, let's not cry.
If I could get rid of just one seven year old
Of these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
I will be with you every step of the way.

CORIOLANUS:
Give me your hand: Come.

SICINIUS:
Invite them all to go home; he is gone, and we will go no further.
The nobility is upset, which we see having taken sides
In his name.

BRUTUS:
Now we have shown our power,
Let's be more humble after it's done
That when it was being done.

SICINIUS:
Invite them to go home:
To say that their great enemy is gone, and that they
Stay in their old strength.

BRUTUS:
Send them home.
This is his mother.

SICINIUS:
Let's not meet her.

BRUTUS:
For what?

SICINIUS:
They say she's crazy.

BRUTUS:
They noticed us: continue on your way.

VOLUMNIA:
Oh, you are welcome: the hoarded plague of the gods
Reward your love!

MENNIUS:
Peace, peace; don't be so loud.

VOLUMNIA:
If I could cry, you should hear,--
No, and you will hear some of them.
Will you be gone?

VIRGILIA:

SICINIUS:
Are you humanity?

VOLUMNIA:
Yes, fool; is it a shame? Note but this fool.
Wasn't my father a man? Do you have foxship
To banish the one who dealt more blows to Rome
How did you pronounce words?

SICINIUS:
O blessed heavens!

VOLUMNIA:
Strokes more noble than ever your wise words;
And for the good of Rome. I'll tell you what; but go ahead:
No, but you will also stay: I would like my son
Were in Arabia, and your tribe before him,
His good sword in hand.

SICINIUS:
So what ?

VIRGILIA:
So what !
He would put an end to your posterity.

VOLUMNIA:
Bastards and all.
Good man, the wounds he bears for Rome!

MENNIUS:
Come, come, peace.

SICINIUS:
I would have liked him to continue in his country
As it began, and did not undo
The noble knot he tied.

BRUTUS:
I wish he had.

VOLUMNIA:
"I would have done it" ! It was you who irritated the populace:
Cats, who can judge its worth as well
As I can of these mysteries that the sky
There will be no earth to know it.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let's go.

VOLUMNIA:
Now, please, sir, go:
You have performed a courageous act. Before you go, listen to this:--
To the extent that the Capitol exceeds
The meanest house in Rome so far, my son...
This lady's husband here, this, you see...
The one you banished surpasses you all.

BRUTUS:
Okay, okay, we'll leave you.

SICINIUS:
Why do we stay being baited
With someone who wants his intelligence?

VOLUMNIA:
Take my prayers with you.
I wish the gods had nothing else to do
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet them
But once a day it would unlock my heart
Of what is heavy to bear.

MENNIUS:
You brought them home;
And, my goodness, you are right. Will you have dinner with me?

VOLUMNIA:
Anger is my meat; I rely on myself,
And so will starve while feeding. Come on, let's go:
Leave this light beating and lament as I do,
Angry, like Juno. Come come come.

MENNIUS:
Fi, fi, fi!

Roman:
I know you well, sir, and you know
me: your name, I think, is Adrian.

Volsce:
It is so, sir: in truth, I have forgotten you.

Roman:
I am Roman; and my services are,
as you are, against them: do you already know me?

Volsce:
Nicanor? No.

Roman:
Same, sir.

Volsce:
You didn't have a beard the last time I saw you; but your
the favor is well approved by your tongue. What is the
any news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian State,
to find you there: you saved me a lot
day of travel.

Roman:
There have been strange insurrections in Rome; THE
the people against the senators, the patricians and the nobles.

Volsce:
It was ! Is it over then? Our state does not think
therefore: they are in the most warlike preparation, and
I hope to meet them in the heat of their division.

Roman:
The main fire is over, but one little thing
would make it burn again: for the nobles receive
therefore at heart the banishment of this worthy
Coriolanus, which they are able to take
all power of the people and to wrest from them
their tribunes forever. This lie shines, I can
I tell you, and it is almost ripe for the violent
to burst.

Volsce:
Coriolanus banished!

Roman:
Banned, sir.

Volsce:
You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.

Roman:
The day serves them well now. I heard it
said, the best time to corrupt a man's wife is
when she falls out with her husband. Your noble
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
great adversary, Coriolanus, no longer being called upon
from his country.

Volsce:
He can't choose. I'm very lucky, so
accidentally meeting you: you ended my
business, and I will happily accompany you home.

Roman:
I will, between this and dinner, tell you the essentials
strange things coming from Rome; all tending to the good of
their adversaries. Do you have an army ready, you say?

Volsce:
One of the most royal; the centurions and their charges,
distinctly confined, already in entertainment,
and be on foot at one hour's warning.

Roman:
I am happy to hear that they are ready and I am
man, I think, that will put them into present action.
So, sir, I bid you a warm welcome and am very happy with your company.

Volsce:
You take my side, sir; I have the most reasons
be happy with yours.

Roman:
Well, let's go together.

CORIOLANUS:
A beautiful city is this Antium. City,
It is I who made your widows: many heirs
Of these beautiful buildings before my wars
Have I heard groaning and falling: then know me not,
Lest your women with spit and your boys with stones
In a puny battle, kill me.
Save yourself, sir.

Citizen:
And you.

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it is your will,
Where does the great Aufidius rest: is he in Antium?

Citizen:
He is and delights the nobles of the State
At his place tonight.

CORIOLANUS:
What is his house, I beg you?

Citizen:
This, here in front of you.

CORIOLANUS:
Thank you, sir: goodbye.
O world, your slippery turns! Friends now swore quickly,
Whose double breasts seem to carry a single heart,
Whose house, whose bed, whose meal and exercise,
Are always together, who are twins, so to speak, in love
Inseparable, must in this hour,
On a dissension of a right, break out
To the bitterest enmity: thus, the dearest enemies,
Whose passions and plots have broken their sleep,
Take each other, by chance,
Something that is not worth an egg will grow, dear friends
And attach their problems. So with me:
My birthplace hates me and my love is there
This enemy city. I will enter: if he kills me,
He delivers fair justice; if he lets me pass,
I will do his national service.

First Servant:
Wine, wine, wine! What service
is here! I think our comrades are asleep.

Second servant:
Where is Cotus? my master calls
for him. Cotus!

CORIOLANUS:
A beautiful house: the party smells good; but I
Don't appear like a guest.

First Servant:
What would you like, my friend? From where are you ?
There is no room for you: pray, go to the door.

CORIOLANUS:
I deserve no better entertainment,
By being Coriolanus.

Second servant:
Where are you from, sir? Does the wearer's eyes meet hers?
head; that it gives access to such companions?
Pray, get out.

CORIOLANUS:
Far!

Second servant:
Far! move away.

CORIOLANUS:
Now you're embarrassing.

Second servant:
Are you so brave? I'll have you speak with Anon.

Third servant:
What type is it?

First Servant:
A strange problem as always: I can't get it
outside the house: please call him my master.

Third servant:
What do you have to do here, my friend? Please avoid
the House.

CORIOLANUS:
Let me get up; I will not harm your home.

Third servant:
What are you?

CORIOLANUS:
A gentleman.

Third servant:
A wonderful poor man.

CORIOLANUS:
That's right, that's who I am.

Third servant:
Please, poor sir, take another
station; there is no room for you here; Please avoid: come.

CORIOLANUS:
Follow your function, go out and fight on cold bits.

Third servant:
What, you won't do it? Please tell my master what
strange guest he has here.

Second servant:
And I will.

Third servant:
Where do you live ?

CORIOLANUS:
Under the glass roof.

Third servant:
Under the glass roof!

CORIOLANUS:
Yes.

Third servant:
Where is it?

CORIOLANUS:
I am the city of kites and crows.

Third servant:
I am the city of kites and crows! What an asshole!
So you also live with birds?

CORIOLANUS:
No, I don't serve your master.

Third servant:
How, sir! are you meddling with my master?

CORIOLANUS:
Yes ; it's a more honest service than meddling in your
mistress. You speak and you speak; serve with your
slicer, then!

AUFIDIUS:
Where is this guy?

Second servant:
Look, sir: I would have beaten him like a dog, but for
disturb the lords within.

AUFIDIUS:
Where do you come from ? what do you want ? your name?
Why don't you speak? speak, man: what is your name?

CORIOLANUS:
Yes, Tullus,
You do not yet know me, and, seeing me, you do not
Think of me for the man I am, necessity
He orders me to name myself.

AUFIDIUS:
What is your name ?

CORIOLANUS:
A name not very musical to the ears of the Volscians,
And a harsh sound for you.

AUFIDIUS:
Say, what's your name?
You have a dark appearance, and your face
It carries a commandment within; although your tackle is torn.
You show a noble vessel: what is your name?

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare your brow to frown: I know
are you already me?

AUFIDIUS:
I don't know you: your name?

CORIOLANUS:
My name is Caius Marcius, who made
To you especially and to all the Volscians
Great harm and mischief; for this purpose, the witness may
My family name, Coriolanus: arduous service,
Extreme dangers and drops of blood
The shed for my ungrateful country is rewarded
But with this last name; a good memory,
And witness the wickedness and discontent
That you should bear me: only this name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Authorized by our ignoble nobles, who
They all abandoned me, they devoured the rest;
And let me be by the voice of slaves
It left Rome. Now this end
Brought me to your home; not out of hope...
Don't get me wrong, to save my life, because if
I was afraid of death, of all men in the world
I would have canceled you, but out of simple spite,
To be completely free from my banishers,
I stand here before you. So if you have it
A broken heart inside you, taking revenge
Your own particular wrongs and stop these mutilations
Shame seen across your country, speed
you straight,
And make my misery serve your turn: so use it
That my avenging services can prove
As a benefit to you, because I will fight
Against my country suffering from cankers with the spleen
Of all the sub-demons. But if that's the case
You don't dare this and that to prove more fortunes
You're tired, so, in a word, I am too
Longer to live the most tired and the most present
My throat to you and your ancient wickedness;
That not cutting would only show you a fool,
Since I always follow you with hatred,
I have drawn barrels of blood from the bosom of your country,
And I can only live to your shame, unless
It's to be of service to you.

AUFIDIUS:
O Marcius, Marcius!
Every word you said weeded my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
If divine things were said from over there,
And say "It's true", I won't believe them anymore
Than you, all noble Marcius. Let me weave
My arms around this body, against
My grainy ashes have broken a hundred times
And I marked the moon with shards: here I cut
The anvil of my sword, and dispute
As warmly and as nobly with your love
As always with ambitious strength I did it
Fight against your worth. Know it first,
I loved the maid I married; never man
I would sigh with a truer breath; but I see you here,
You, noble thing! more dances my delighted heart
That when I first saw my married mistress
Cross my threshold. Well, you, Mars! I'm telling you,
We have power on foot; and I had a goal
Once more to carve your target into your muscles,
Or lose my strong arm: you beat me
Twelve times several times, and I have every night since
I dreamed of meetings between you and me;
We slept together in my sleep,
Unbuckling helmets, clutching throats,
And I woke up half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we not had another quarrel with Rome, but this
You are banished from there, we would all gather
From twelve to seventy, and a torrential war
In the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood on the bear. Oh, come, come in,
And take our senator friends by the hand;
Who are now here, taking leave of me,
Who am prepared against your territories,
But not for Rome itself.

CORIOLANUS:
You bless me, gods!

AUFIDIUS:
Therefore, most absolute gentleman, if you wish
Take your own revenge, take
Half of my commission; and I sat down...
To the best of your experience, since you know
The strength and weakness of your country, your own ways;
Whether to knock on the doors of Rome,
Or roughly visit them in remote areas,
To scare them, before destroying them. But enter:
Let me first recommend you to those who
Say yes to your desires. A thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than ever an enemy;
However, Marcius, it was a lot. Your hand: welcome!

First Servant:
Here's a strange modification!

Second servant:
By my hand, I thought I had hit him with
a club; and yet my spirit gave me its clothes in fact one
false report about him.

First Servant:
What an arm he has! he returned me with his
finger and thumb, as one would set up a top.

Second servant:
No, I knew by his face there was something in it
him: he had, sir, a sort of face, I thought, - I
I can't say what to name it.

First Servant:
He had done it; looking as if...would I be hanged,
but I thought there was more to him than I could think.

Second servant:
Me too, I swear: he is simply the rarest
man, I am the world.

First Servant:
I think he is: but he is a greater soldier than he, as you think.

Second servant:
Who, my master?

First Servant:
No, that doesn't matter.

Second servant:
It's worth six.

First Servant:
No, that's not the case either: but I take it for the
greatest soldier.

Second servant:
Well, look, we don't know how to say that:
for the defense of a city, our general is excellent.

First Servant:
Yes, and for an assault too.

Third servant:
O slaves, I can tell you news, news, rascals!

First Servant:
What what what? let's participate.

Third servant:
I would not be a Roman of all nations; I had like
I believe I am a doomed man.

First Servant:
For this reason? for this reason?

Third servant:
Well, here's the one who used to hit our general,
Caius Marcius.

First Servant:
Why do you say “hit our general”?

Third servant:
I’m not saying “hit our general”; but it has always been
good enough for him.

Second servant:
Come, we are comrades and friends: he always was too
hard for him; I heard him say it himself.

First Servant:
It was too hard for him directly, to tell the truth
on't: in front of Corioli, he hit and cut him
him like a teenage carbon.

Second servant:
If it had been cannibalistically given, it could have
grilled it and ate it too.

First Servant:
But do you still have news about yourself?

Third servant:
Well he's so done here inside, like he's her son
and heir of Mars; placed at the upper end of the table; No
question was asked to him by one of the senators, but they
remains bald in front of him: our general himself makes a
mistress of him: sanctifies herself with the hand and
he rolls his eyes at his speech. But
the bottom line is that our general is eliminated
the middle and only half of what it was
yesterday; for the other has half, by supplication
and the granting of the whole table. He will go, he says,
and sows the gatekeeper of the gates of Rome by the ears: he
he will mow down everything before him and leave his path searched.

Second servant:
And he's as willing to do nothing as any man I can imagine.

Third servant:
Point! he will not do it; because, you see, sir, he has like
many friends as well as enemies; what friends, sir, because
don't you dare, look, sir, show yourself, like
we call him his friends while he is in directitude.

First Servant:
Directness! What is this?

Third servant:
But when they see, sir, his crest raised again,
and the bleeding man, they will come out of their
burrows, like conies after the rain, and delight in all
him.

First Servant:
But when will this move forward?

Third servant:
Tomorrow; Today; currently; you will have the
The drum sounded this afternoon: it's like a
part of their celebration, and to be executed before they
wipe their lips.

Second servant:
Well, then we will have a moving world again.
This peace is nothing but to rust iron, to increase
tailors and ballad creators.

First Servant:
Let me wage war, I said; this goes beyond peace to the extent that
day becomes night; it is lively, alert, audible, and
full of vents. Peace is a true apoplexy, a lethargy;
thoughtful, dull, drowsy, insensible; one more getter
bastard children, war is a destroyer of men.

Second servant:
This is how it is: and as we can say that war, in a way,
be a kidnapper, so we cannot deny it but peace is a
great cuckold maker.

First Servant:
Yes, and it makes men hate each other.

Third servant:
Reason; because they then need each other less.
Wars for my money. I hope to see the Romans as cheap
like Volsci. They go up, they go up.

All:
In, in, in, in!

SICINIUS:
We hear of him not, nor need we fear him;
Its remedies are tamed in the present peace
And the calm of the people, who before
We were in a big hurry. This is where you make friends
Blush that the world is well, who would have preferred to have it,
Even though they themselves suffered from it, here is
Dissident figures harass the streets rather than see
Our merchants are in their stores and leaving
About their friendly functions.

BRUTUS:
We got up in time.
Is it Menenius?

SICINIUS:
It's him, it's him: Oh, he grew up very late.

The two Tribunes:
Hi mister !

MENNIUS:
Hello to both of you!

SICINIUS:
Your Coriolanus
He doesn't miss him much, but with his friends:
The Republic remains standing, and it would too,
Was he any more angry at this.

MENNIUS:
Everything is fine; and it could have been much better, if
He could have delayed.

SICINIUS:
Where is he, you hear?

MENNIUS:
No, I don't hear anything: his mother and his wife
Don't hear anything from him.

Citizens:
The gods preserve you both!

SICINIUS:
Damn, our neighbors.

BRUTUS:
Damn it to you all, damn it to you all.

First citizen:
Ourselves, our wives and our children, on our knees,
I have to pray for you both.

SICINIUS:
Live and prosper!

BRUTUS:
Farewell, good neighbors: we wish Coriolanus
I loved you like us.

Citizens:
Now the gods keep you!

The two Tribunes:
Farewell, farewell.

SICINIUS:
It's a happier and more pleasant time
That when these guys were running in the streets,
Crying in confusion.

BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer in war; but insolent,
O'ercome of pride, ambitious beyond all thought,
Self-lover,--

SICINIUS:
And affecting a single throne,
Without help.

MENNIUS:
I do not think so.

SICINIUS:
We should thereby, in all our lamentations,
If he had become consul, he would have found it that way.

BRUTUS:
The gods prevented it, and Rome
Sitting safe and still without him.

AEdile:
Worthy tribunes,
There is a slave we have put in prison,
Reports, the Volscians with two different powers
Entered Roman territories,
And with the deepest wickedness of war
Destroy what is in front of them.

MENNIUS:
It's Aufidius,
Who, hearing of the banishment of our Marcius,
He once again throws his horns into the world;
Who were in shell when Marcius represented Rome,
And I didn't dare take a look.

SICINIUS:
Come on, what are you talking about
From Marcius?

BRUTUS:
Go see this rumor whipped. It can not be
The Volscians dare to break with us.

MENNIUS:
It's not possible!
We know very well that it is possible,
And three similar examples were
At my age. But reason with this man,
Before punishing him, where he heard this,
Lest you get the chance to flog your information
And defeat the messenger who tells you to beware
Of what is to be feared.

SICINIUS:
Do not tell me :
I know that can't be the case.

BRUTUS:
Not possible.

Messenger:
The nobles leave with great seriousness
All in the Senate: news has arrived
It changes their face.

SICINIUS:
It is this slave; -
Go and whip him, before the eyes of the people: - his elevation;
Just his report.

Messenger:
Yes, worthy sir,
The slave's report is supported; and more,
No longer fearful, he is delivered.

SICINIUS:
What's scarier?

Messenger:
Many people are talking about it freely...
What is the probability, I do not know, that Marcius,
Associated with Aufidius, he leads a power against Rome,
And swear revenge as widely as between the two
The youngest and the oldest.

SICINIUS:
It's very likely !

BRUTUS:
High only, so that the weakest can wish
Good Marcius home again.

SICINIUS:
That's the very thing.

MENNIUS:
It's unlikely :
He and Aufidius can no longer atone
Than the most violent annoyance.

Second messenger:
You are summoned to the Senate:
A fearsome army, led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius, rages
On our territories; and I already have
They overcame their way, were consumed by fire and took
What awaited them.

COMINIUS:
Oh, you did a good job!

MENNIUS:
What's new? What's new?

COMINIUS:
You must help rape your own daughters and
Melting the city leads on your pasta,
To see your women dishonored up to their noses,

MENNIUS:
What are the news? What are the news?

COMINIUS:
Your temples have burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, on which you stood, confined
In the bore of an auger.

MENNIUS:
Pray now, your news?
You've done a good job, I'm afraid. — Please, any news from you?
If Marcius were to join the Volscians,

COMINIUS:
If!
He is their god: he leads them like a thing
Made by a deity other than nature,
This shapes man better; and they follow him,
Against us kids, with no less confidence
Only boys chasing summer butterflies,
Or butchers killing flies.

MENNIUS:
You did a good job,
You and your men in aprons; you who got up so much
on the voice of the occupation and
The breath of garlic eaters!

COMINIUS:
He will tremble
Your Rome about your ears.

MENNIUS:
Like Hercules
I shook the soft fruit.
You did a fair job!

BRUTUS:
But is it true, sir?

COMINIUS:
Yes ; and you will look pale
Before finding another one. all the regions
Rebel with a smile; and who resists
Are mocked for their valiant ignorance,
And the constant fools perish. Who can't blame him?
Your enemies and his enemies find something in him.

MENNIUS:
We are all lost, unless
The noble man has pity.

COMINIUS:
Who will ask it?
The tribunes cannot do it out of shame; people
Deserves as much pity from him as the wolf
Made shepherds: for his best friends, if they
Should say "Be good to Rome", they even accused him
As those who should have done this deserved his hatred,
And there I would show enemies.

MENNIUS:
It's true :
If he put the mark on me
It should consume him, I don't have the stomach
To say “I beg you, stop”. You have done good hands,
You and your creations! you created a fair!

COMINIUS:
You brought
A tremor over Rome, such as never before
So unable to help.

The two Tribunes:
Don't say we brought it.

MENNIUS:
How! Was it us? we loved him but, like animals
And the noble cowards have yielded to your clusters,
Who booed him out of town.

COMINIUS:
But I'm scared
They will roar it again. Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys its points
As if he were his officer: despair
It's all politics, strength and defense,
What Rome can do against them.

MENNIUS:
Here are the clusters.
And is Aufidius with him? You are them
It made the air unhealthy when you threw
Your greasy, stinking caps hooting
The exile of Coriolanus. Now he is coming;
And not a hair on a soldier's head
What will not be a whip: so many fatties
While you threw caps it will fall,
And you pay for your votes. It's not serious ;
if he could burn us all in one coal,
We deserved it.

Citizens:
Well, we hear some scary news.

First citizen:
For my part,
When I said ban it, I said it was a shame.

Second citizen:
And me too.

Third citizen:
And me too ; and, to tell the truth, very
many of us: what we have done, we have done for the best; And
although we have voluntarily consented to its banishment,
it was against our will.

COMINIUS:
You are beautiful things, you voices!

MENNIUS:
You did
Good job, you and your cry! Are we going to the Capitol?

COMINIUS:
Oh, yes, what else?

SICINIUS:
Come on, masters, take you home; do not be dismayed:
This is a team that would be happy to have
It is a truth that they seem to fear so much. Go home,
And don't show any signs of fear.

First citizen:
May the gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's go home.
I already said we were wrong when we banned
him.

Second citizen:
U.S. too. But come on, let's go home.

BRUTUS:
I don't like this news.

SICINIUS:
Nor me.

BRUTUS:
Let's go to the Capitol. Half of my wealth
I would buy that for a lie!

SICINIUS:
Pray, let's go.

AUFIDIUS:
Do they still fly to the Roman?

Lieutenant:
I don't know what witchcraft there is in him, but
Your soldiers use it as grace before meat,
Their conversation at the table and their thanks at the end;
And you are obscured by this action, sir,
Even by yourself.

AUFIDIUS:
I can't help it now,
Unless by using means, I lame my foot
Of our design. He carries himself more proudly,
Even to me, what I thought he would do
When I first kissed him: yet his nature
He's not a changeling; and I must apologize
Which cannot be changed.

Lieutenant:
However, I wish, sir,...
I mean for your particular, you didn't have
Joined in committee with him; but either
Had supported your action, otherwise
He had left that to her only.

AUFIDIUS:
I understand you well; and be sure,
when he will come to his own account, he does not know
What I can blame him for. Even though it seems,
And that's what he thinks, and it's no less obvious
In the eyes of the vulgar, he bears everything fairly.
And shows good breeding for the Volscian State,
Fight like a dragon and get there ASAP
As draws his sword; yet he did not
Whoever breaks his neck or risks mine,
When we arrive at our account.

Lieutenant:
Sir, I beg you, do you think he will take Rome?

AUFIDIUS:
All the places give way to him before he sits down;
And the nobility of Rome belongs to him:
Senators and patricians like it too:
The tribunes are not soldiers; and their people
Will be as reckless in repealing, as hasty
To kick him out of there. I think he will be in Rome
Like the osprey the fish, who takes it
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
A noble servant to them; But he could not
Even bear his honors: let it be pride,
Which, by daily fortune, always taints
The happy man; whether it is a lack of judgment,
Failing to manage these chances
Of whom he was the lord; or if nature,
Not to be anything other than one thing, not to move
From helmet to cushion, but commanding peace
Even with the same austerity and the same costume
As he controlled the war; but one of them...
As it has all the spices, but not all,
Because until now I dare to free him, to make him fear,
So hated and so banished: but he has merit,
To stifle it in the statement. So our virtues
Lying in the interpretation of the time:
And power, in itself very praiseworthy,
Is there no tomb as obvious as a chair
To praise what he did.
A fire chases a fire; a nail, a nail;
Rights by rights fail, forces by forces fail.
Come, let's go. When, Caius, Rome will be yours,
You are the poorest of all; then soon you are mine.

MENNIUS:
No, I won't go: you hear what he said
What was once his general; who loved him
In a very expensive individual. He called me father:
But what does it do? Go, you who banished him;
A mile before his tent collapses and kneels
The path to his mercy: no, if he was timid
To hear Cominius speak, I will stay at home.

COMINIUS:
He doesn't seem to know me.

MENNIUS:
Do you hear?

COMINIUS:
However, once he called me by my name:
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
That we bled together. Coriolanus
He did not respond to: ban all names;
It was sort of nothing, without a title,
Until he made his name on fire
To burn Rome.

MENNIUS:
Well, then: you did a good job!
Two tribunes who fought for Rome,
Making coal cheaply, noble memory!

COMINIUS:
I pointed out to him how royal it was to forgive
When we expected it less: he replied:
It was a simple petition from a state
To the one they had punished.

MENNIUS:
Alright:
Could he say less?

COMINIUS:
I offered to awaken his gaze
For's private friends: his response was:
He couldn't stay and pick them into piles
Bad moldy bullets: he said it was madness,
For one or two poor grains, to leave intact,
And always to sniff out the offense.

MENNIUS:
For a poor grain or two!
I am one of them; his mother, his wife, his child,
And this brave boy too, we are the grains:
You are moldy straw; and you feel
Above the moon: we must be burned for you.

SICINIUS:
No, pray, be patient: if you refuse your help
In this help if ever needed, but don't do it
Reproaches concern our distress. But of course, if you
Would be the litigant of your country, your good tongue,
More than the instant army we can create,
This could stop our compatriot.

MENNIUS:
No, I won't get involved.

SICINIUS:
Please go to him.

MENNIUS:
What should I do?

BRUTUS:
Just try what your love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.

MENNIUS:
Well, and say that Marcius
Send me back, as Cominius has returned,
Unheard of; so what ?
But as a disgruntled, grief-stricken friend
With his wickedness? say that's not the case?

SICINIUS:
Yet your good will
I must receive these thanks from Rome, after the measure
As you well intended.

MENNIUS:
I take care of it:
I think he will hear me. Yet bite your lip
And humming the good Cominius discourages me a lot.
It was not taken well; he had not eaten dinner:
The veins are not full, our blood is cold, and then
We pout in the morning, we are unfit
To give or forgive; but when we have stuff
These and these transports of our blood
With wine and food we have more flexible souls
That in our priestly fasts: this is why I will watch over him
Until he went on a diet at my request,
And then I'll go after him.

BRUTUS:
You know the path that leads to his kindness,
And I can't lose my way.

MENNIUS:
In good faith, I will prove to him,
Accelerate as you see fit. I will soon have the knowledge
Of my success.

COMINIUS:
He will never hear it.

SICINIUS:
Not?

COMINIUS:
I tell you, he sits in gold, his eyes
Red like Rome would be burned; and his injury
The jailer has his pity. I knelt before him;
“It was very weakly that he said: “Get up; sent me back
So, with his silent hand: what would he do,
He sent me a writing; what he wouldn't do,
Bound by the oath to yield to its conditions:
So all hope is in vain.
Unless his noble mother and his wife;
Who, from what I hear, wants to solicit him
Out of pity for his country. Therefore, let us say,
And through our righteous supplications, hurry them.

First senator:
Rest: where are you from?

Second senator:
Get up and come back.

MENNIUS:
You watch like men; that's good: but, with your permission,
I am an officer of state, and come
Talk to Coriolanus.

First senator:
From where?

MENNIUS:
From Rome.

First senator:
You cannot pass, you must return: our general
I won't have any more news from there.

Second senator:
You will see your Rome kissed by fire before
You will speak to Coriolanus.

MENNIUS:
Well my friends,
If you heard your general talking about Rome,
And of his friends there, it's a lot of blank,
My name has touched your ears, it is Menenius.

First senator:
So be it ; come back: the virtue of your name
It is not practical here.

MENNIUS:
I tell you, my friend,
The general is my lover: I have been
The book of his good deeds, where men have read
Its unprecedented name, perhaps amplified;
Cause I always checked on my friends,
Of which he is the leader, with all the size of this truth
I would suffer without decline: no, sometimes,
Like a bowl on a subtle background,
I passed the throw; and in his praise
I almost stamped the lease: so, my friend,
I must have permission to pass.

First senator:
Well, sir, if you had told so many lies in his
name as you said personal words, you
should not pass here; no, even if it was also virtuous
lying like living chastely. Therefore, go back.

MENNIUS:
Please, my friend, remember that my name is Menenius,
still a faction of your general's party.

Second senator:
Either way, you were his liar, like you said
have, I am he who, speaking truth under him, must
say, you can't pass. Therefore, go back.

MENNIUS:
Has he had dinner, can you tell? because I wouldn't
talk to him until after dinner.

First senator:
You are Roman, aren't you?

MENNIUS:
I am, as is your general.

First senator:
Then you should hate Rome, like him. Can you,
when you have pushed your doors open as quickly as possible
defender of them, and, in a violent popular campaign
ignorance, given your shield to your enemy, think about
face its vengeance with the easy groans of old
women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
the paralyzed intercession of a rotten endowment like
you seem to be? Can you think of blowing up the
fire predicted, your city is ready to go up in flames, with
breath as faint as this? No, you are deceived;
therefore, return to Rome and prepare for your
execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
you no longer have reprieve and forgiveness.

MENNIUS:
Sirrah, if your captain knew I was here, he would
use me with estimation.

Second senator:
Come, my captain doesn't know you.

MENNIUS:
I mean, your general.

First senator:
My general doesn't care about you. Return, I say, go; of fear
I spilled your half-pint of blood; back, it's
the most of what you have: the return.

MENNIUS:
No, but, my friend, my friend,…

CORIOLANUS:
What is the problem?

MENNIUS:
Now, mate, I'll tell you a race:
You will know now that I am in esteem; you should
understand that a Jack guard can't order me since
my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
with him, if you do not keep yourself in the state of
hanging, or a longer death
spectator and crueler in suffering; Here now
right now, and swoon at what is happening to you.
The glorious gods sit hourly in synod about your
special prosperity, and I love you no more than
your old father Menenius knows it! O my son, my son!
you prepare a fire for us; look, here it is
water to extinguish it. I was barely moved to come
you; but being assured that no one but me could move
you, I was blown out of your doors with
sighs; and begs you to forgive Rome and your
fellow petitioners. The good gods reassure your
anger, and returns the dregs on this varlet
here, this one who, like a block, denied my
access to you.

CORIOLANUS:
Far!

MENNIUS:
How! far!

CORIOLANUS:
Wife, mother, child, I don't know. My stuff
Are at the service of others: even if I must
My revenge proper, my remission lies
In the Volscian breasts. That we were familiar,
Ungrateful forgetting will rather poison
Too bad to note how many. Therefore, leave.
My ears against your suits are louder than
Your doors against my strength. Yet, because I loved you,
Take this with you; I write it for you
And I would have praised it. One more word, Menenius,
I won't hear you speak. This man, Aufidius,
Was my beloved in Rome: and yet you see him!

AUFIDIUS:
You maintain a constant character.

First senator:
Now, sir, is your name Menenius?

Second senator:
It is a spell, you see, of great power: you know the
back home.

First senator:
Do you hear how much we are blamed for keeping your
greatness has returned?

Second senator:
Why do you think I should faint?

MENNIUS:
I care neither for the world nor for your general: because
things like you I can hardly think there are,
you are so light. The one who has the will to die
he himself does not fear it from another: let your general
do his best. For you, be what you are, for a long time; And
your misery increases with your age! I'm telling you,
as I was told, Away!

First senator:
A noble boy, I guarantee it.

Second senator:
The brave boy is our general: he is the rock, the
the oak must not be shaken by the wind.

CORIOLANUS:
We will be before the walls of Rome tomorrow
Drop off our host. My partner in this action,
You must report to the Volscian lords, with what clarity
I put up with this affair.

AUFIDIUS:
Only their ends
You respected; you covered your ears against
The general trial of Rome; never admitted
A private whisper, no, not with such friends
That made them think they were sure of you.

CORIOLANUS:
This last old man,
Which I sent to Rome, with a broken heart,
Loved me above the measure of a father;
No, it really made me happy. Their last refuge
It was to send it; for whom I have old love,
Even though I showed him bitterly, once again I offered him
The first conditions, which they refused
And I cannot now accept; just to give him thanks
That thought he could do more, very little
I gave in to: new embassies and new costumes,
Neither from the State nor from private friends, now
Will I listen to. Ha! what cry is this?
Should I be tempted to break my vow
At the same time is it done? I'm not going to.
My wife comes first; then the honored mold
In which this trunk was framed, and in his hand
The granddaughter has his blood. But outside, affection!
All bonds and privileges of nature, break!
How virtuous it is to be stubborn.
What is this reverence worth? or those dove eyes,
What can make the gods renounce? I'm melting and I'm not
Of earth stronger than the others. My mother bows;
As if Olympus should be a molehill
As a sign of supplication: and my young boy
Has an aspect of intercession, which
The great nature cries “Don’t deny”. let the Volscians
Plow Rome and harrow Italy: I will never do it
Be such a gosling to obey your instinct, but stay upright,
As if a man were the author of himself
And didn't know any other relatives.

VIRGILIA:
My lord and husband!

CORIOLANUS:
These eyes are not the same as the ones I wore in Rome.

VIRGILIA:
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
It makes you think so.

CORIOLANUS:
Like a boring actor now,
I forgot my role and I'm leaving,
Even to total shame. The best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but don't say
For this “Forgive our Romans”. O, a kiss
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, this kiss
I took it away from you, my dear; and my real lip
Since then, it has remained blank. Gods ! I'm kidding,
And the noblest mother in the world
Leave without salvation: sink, my knee, I am the earth;
Of your deep duty, more impressions show
Than that of common threads.

VOLUMNIA:
O, arise, blessed one!
While, without a cushion softer than flint,
I kneel before you; and bad
Show your duty, how wrong you've been all this time
Between child and parent.

CORIOLANUS:
What is this?
Your knees against me? to your son corrected?
So leave the stones on the hungry beach
Fill in the stars; so let the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cedars “against the fiery sun;
Murder the impossibility, to do
Which cannot be, light work.

VOLUMNIA:
You are my warrior;
I help supervise you. Do you know this lady?

CORIOLANUS:
The noble sister of Publicola,
The moon of Rome, chaste like the ice cube
It's curdled by the frost of the purest snow
And hanging on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!

VOLUMNIA:
That's a poor summary on your part.
Which, according to the interpretation of full time
Can show as all yourself.

CORIOLANUS:
The god of soldiers,
With the consent of Supreme Jupiter, inform
Your thoughts with nobility; so you can prove
Shame the invulnerable and stay in wars
Like a great marine brand, resistant to every fault,
And save those who look at you!

VOLUMNIA:
Your knee, sir.

CORIOLANUS:
That's my good boy!

VOLUMNIA:
Even him, your wife, this lady and myself,
Are your suitors.

CORIOLANUS:
I beg you, peace:
Or, if you ask, remember this first:
The thing I gave up giving can never
Be restrained by your denials. Don't bid me
Send back my soldiers or surrender
Once again with the mechanics of Rome: don't tell me
Where I seem unnatural: do not desire
To combine my rages and my vengeance with
Your coldest reasons.

VOLUMNIA:
Oh, no more, no more!
You said you wouldn't give us anything;
Because we have nothing more to ask than this
What you already deny: yet we will ask it;
That if you fail in our request, the blame
May you cling to your hardness: listen to us.

CORIOLANUS:
Aufidius, and you Volscians, note; For good
Don't hear anything from Rome in private. Your request?

VOLUMNIA:
Should we be silent and not speak, our clothes
And the state of the bodies would betray what life
We have ruled since your exile. Think with yourself
How more unfortunate than all the women alive
Have we come here: since your sight,
that should
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
with comfort,
Forces them to cry and tremble with fear and sorrow;
Show the mother, the woman and the child
The heartbreaking son, husband and father
His country's bowels are empty. And to the poor we
The greatest capital of your enmity: you forbid us
Our prayers to the gods, who are a comfort
That's it, but we appreciate it; because how can we,
Alas, how can we pray for our country.
To what we are bound, with your victory,
Where are we bound? alas, or we must lose
The country, our dear nurse, or your person,
Our comfort in the countryside. We must find
An obvious calamity, even if we had
Our wish, which side should win: either you
Must, as a foreign recreationalist, be driven
With handcuffs in our streets, otherwise
marches triumphantly over the ruin of your country,
And bears the palm for having courageously lost
The blood of your wife and your children. For me, my son,
I intend not to wait for fortune until
These wars determine: if I can't persuade you
Rather to show noble grace to both parties
Rather than looking for the end of one, you won't do it sooner
March to attack your country rather than march...
Trust him, you won't... in your mother's womb,
It brought you into this world.

VIRGILIA:
Yes, and mine,
It gave you birth to this boy, to keep your name
Live in time.

Young MARCIUS:
A' won't step on me;
I will run away until I am older, but then I will fight.

CORIOLANUS:
Not with the tenderness of a woman,
Does not require the face of a child or a woman to be seen.
I've been sitting too long.

VOLUMNIA:
No, don't walk away from us like that.
If it were so that our request tended
Save the Romans, therefore destroy
The Volscians you serve, you could condemn us,
Like poison for your honor: no; our costume
It is because you reconcile them: while the Volscians
Can say: “This mercy we have shown; » the Romans,
“This we have received; » and each on each side
I salute you and cry "Be blessed
For having invented this peace! » You know it, big son,
The end of the war is uncertain, but this certainty,
That if you conquer Rome, the profit
What you will thus reap is such a name,
The repetition of which will be accompanied by curses;
Whose chronicle writes: “This man was noble,
But on his last attempt, he erased it;
He destroyed his country and his name remains
In the following century, abhorred. Talk to me, my son:
You affected the beautiful tensions of honor,
Imitate the graces of the gods;
To tear with thunder the broad cheeks of the air,
And yet charge your sulfur with a bolt
This should only anger an oak tree. Why don't you speak?
Do you think it's honorable for a noble man
Do you still have to remember the wrongs? My daughter, speak to yourself:
He doesn't care about your crying. Speak, my boy:
Maybe your childishness will move him more
Just like our reasons. There is no man in the world
More related to the mother of; yet here he lets me chat
Like one in stock. You never in your life
I have shown your dear mother a courtesy,
When she, poor hen, not liking a second brood,
Took you to wars and brought you home safely,
Charged with honor. Say my request is unfair,
And push me away: but if it is not so,
You are not honest; and the gods will torment you,
That you hold me back from duty which
A mother's role belongs. He turns away:
Down, ladies; let's shame him off our knees.
Coriolanus yearns for more pride in his family name
What pity for our prayers. Down: an end;
This is the last: we will therefore return to Rome,
And die among our neighbors. No, here it is:
This boy, who can't say what he would have
But kneels and holds up bands for camaraderie,
Does he reason our petition more forcefully?
So you have to deny it. Come on, let's go:
This man had a Volscan woman for a mother;
His wife is in Corioli and his child
Like him by chance. However, give us our dispatch:
I'll keep quiet until our city is on fire,
And then I'll talk a little.

CORIOLANUS:
O mother, mother!
What have you done? Behold, the heavens are opened,
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
They laugh. O my mother, mother! Oh!
You have won a happy victory against Rome;
But, for your son, believe it, oh, believe it,
The most dangerous thing is that you triumphed over him,
If not the most deadly for him. But let it come.
Aufidius, although I cannot wage real wars,
I will frame a suitable peace. Now, good Aufidius,
If you were in my place, would you have heard
One less mother? or granted less, Aufidius?

AUFIDIUS:
I was moved by this.

CORIOLANUS:
I dare to swear that you were:
And, sir, it's not nothing to do
My eyes sweat with compassion. But good sir,
What peace you will make, advise me: for my part,
I will not go to Rome, I will return with you; and I pray to you,
Stand with me in this cause. O mother! marry!

AUFIDIUS:

CORIOLANUS:
Yes, little by little;
But we will drink together; and you will bear
A better testimony than words, than us,
Under similar conditions, it will be counter-sealed.
Come, come in with us. Ladies, you deserve
To build you a temple: all the swords
In Italy and in its Confederate arms,
I couldn't have made this peace.

MENNIUS:
We'll see you there in front of the Capitol, over there
corner stone ?

SICINIUS:
Why, what about that?

MENNIUS:
If it is possible for you to move it with your
little finger, there is a little hope, the ladies of
Rome, and especially his mother, could prevail over him.
But I say there is no hope: our throats are
convicted and suspended until his execution.

SICINIUS:
Is it not possible that such a short period of time could change the
condition of man!

MENNIUS:
There is a difference between a worm and a butterfly;
yet your butterfly was a larva. This Marcius is grown
from man to dragon: he has wings; he is more than one
creeping thing.

SICINIUS:
He loved his mother very much.

MENNIUS:
Me too: and he no longer remembers his mother
now only an eight year old horse. Acidity
ripe grapes from his sour face: when he walks, he
moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
his trampling: he is capable of piercing a corset with
his eye; speaks like a death knell, and its hum is a
battery. He sits in his state, like a thing made for
Alexander. What he proposes to do is finished
his auctions. He wants nothing more from a god than eternity
and a paradise to enthrone.

SICINIUS:
Yes, mercy, if you denounce it sincerely.

MENNIUS:
I paint him in character. Show what mercy he
the mother will bring him: there is no more mercy
in him there is no milk in a male tiger; that
will our poor city find: and all this is long
You.

SICINIUS:
May the gods be good to us!

MENNIUS:
No, in such a case the gods will not be kind to
We. When we banned it, we did not respect them;
and, returning to break our necks, they do not respect us.

Messenger:
Sir, if you want to save your life, fly home:
The plebeians have your comrade from the platform
And haul it up and down, swearing, if
Roman ladies bring no comfort to the house,
They will kill him within a few centimeters.

SICINIUS:
What are the news?

Second messenger:
Good news, good news; the ladies prevailed,
The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius leaves:
Never has a more joyful day greeted Rome,
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

SICINIUS:
Friend,
Are you sure this is true? is it very safe?

Second messenger:
As certain as I know, the sun is fire:
Where are you hiding to doubt it?
Never through an arch was the tide blown so precipitate,
As the comforted through the doors. Well, I'm listening to you!
Trumpets, sackbuts, psalters and fifes,
Drums and cymbals and Romans shouting,
Make the sun dance. Listen to yourself!

MENNIUS:
It's good news:
I'm going to go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
Worth consuls, senators, patricians,
A full city; tribunes like you,
A full sea and land. You prayed well today:
This morning for ten thousand of your throats
I wouldn't have given homework. Listen, how happy they are!

SICINIUS:
First, the gods bless you for your news; following,
Accept my gratitude.

Second messenger:
Sir, we all have
Excellent reason to thank warmly.

SICINIUS:
Are they near the city?

Second messenger:
Almost to the point of entering.

SICINIUS:
We will meet them,
And help joy.

First senator:
Here is our patroness, the life of Rome!
Gather all your tribes, praise the gods,
And make triumphant fires; spread flowers in front of them:
Do not shout the noise that banished Marcius,
Repeal him with his mother's welcome;
Shout “Welcome, ladies, welcome!” »

All:
Welcome ladies, welcome!

AUFIDIUS:
Go tell the city lords that I'm here:
Give them this paper: after reading it,
Offer them a trip to the market; Or I,
Even to their ears and to the ears of the common people,
I will vouch for the truth. Him, I accuse him
The city's ports entered this way and
Intends to appear before the people, hoping
Purge yourself with words: hurry.
Welcome!

First conspirator:
How are things going with our general?

AUFIDIUS:
Anyway
Like a man poisoned by his own alms,
And with his charity killed.

Second conspirator:
Very noble sir,
If you have the same intention in which
You wished us a holiday, we will deliver
Of your great danger.

AUFIDIUS:
Sir, I cannot say:
We have to proceed as we find the people.

Third conspirator:
People will remain uncertain while
“There is a difference between you; but the fall of one or the other
Makes the survivor heir of all.

AUFIDIUS:
I know that;
And my pretext for hitting him confesses
A good build. I raised him and pawned him
My honor for his truth: which being so high,
He watered his new plants with dews of flattery,
Thus seduce my friends; and, to this end,
He bent his nature, never before known
But to be tough, steadfast and free.

Third conspirator:
Sir, his build
When he presented himself as consul, what he lost
Failing to bend down,...

AUFIDIUS:
which I would have spoken about:
Having been banished for this, he came to my home;
I presented his throat to my knife: I took it;
He made him a servant with me; gave him the way
In all his own desires; no, let him choose
From my files, his projects to accomplish,
My best and freshest men; served his purposes
In my own person; helps to reap fame
What he put an end to all his; and I took a certain pride
To do me this harm: until at the end,
I felt like I was his disciple, not his partner, and
He fought me with his face, as if
I had been a mercenary.

First conspirator:
This is what he did, my lord:
The army was amazed, and, in the end,
When he carried Rome and we watched
For no less waste than glory,

AUFIDIUS:
There was this:
This is why my tendons will be tense on him.
A few drops of woman's rum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold blood and labor
Of our great deed: therefore will he die,
And I will renew myself at his fall. But listen!

First conspirator:
Your hometown you are entering would like a position,
And he was not welcomed home: but he comes again,
Divide the air with noise.

Second conspirator:
And patient fools,
Whose children he killed, their vile throats are torn
By giving him glory.

Third conspirator:
Therefore, in your opinion,
Before he speaks out or moves people
With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
Which we will second. When he lies down,
After your way, his spoken history will bury him
His reasons with his body.

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more:
Here are the lords.

All lords:
You are welcome at your home.

AUFIDIUS:
I didn't deserve it.
But, worthy lords, have you carefully read
What did I write to you?

Lords:
We have.

First Lord:
And I'm sad to hear it.
What mistakes he made before the last one, I think
I might have found fines easy: but there to finish
Where he had to start and give
The benefit of our direct debits, we respond
With our own responsibility, conclude a treaty where
There was a surrender, that admits of no excuse.

AUFIDIUS:
He is coming closer: you will hear him.

CORIOLANUS:
Hail, lords! I have become your soldier,
I am no longer infected by the love of my country
That when I parted from here, but I still subsist
Under your great command. You have to know
It was with success that I tried and
With a bloody passage, your wars even led to
The gates of Rome. Our loot that we brought home
Do more than counterbalance a full third game
Accusations of action. We made peace
With no less honor to the Antiates
What shame for the Romans: and here we deliver,
Subscribed by consuls and patricians,
With the seal of the Senate, what
We have made the situation worse.

AUFIDIUS:
Do not read it, noble lords;
But tell the traitor, to the highest degree
He abused your powers.

CORIOLANUS:
Traitor! how now!

AUFIDIUS:
Yes, traitor, Marcius!

CORIOLANUS:
Marcius!

AUFIDIUS:
Yes, Marcius, Caius Marcius: do you think
I will pardon you for this theft, your stolen name
Coriolanus to Corioli?
You, lords and heads of state, treacherously
He betrayed your company and abandoned,
For some drops of salt, your city Rome,
I say “your city” to his wife and his mother;
Breaking one's oath and resolve as
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting it
War council, but to the tears of his nurse
He cried and roared your victory,
That the pages blushed at him and men of heart
Look at yourself, you will ask yourself questions.

CORIOLANUS:
Do you hear, Mars?

AUFIDIUS:
Don't name the god, boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS:
Ha!

AUFIDIUS:
No more.

CORIOLANUS:
Liar without measure, you made my heart
Too awesome for what's in it. Boy! O slave!
Forgive me, lords, this is the first time
I had to growl. Your judgments, my grave lords,
This dog must be denied: and his own idea...
Who wears my stripes printed on him; that
Must bear my blows to his grave - I will join him
To impose the lie on him.

First Lord:
Peace to both of you and hear me speak.

CORIOLANUS:
Cut me into pieces, Volsces; men and boys,
Stain all your edges on me. Boy! fake dog!
If your records are true, it is there,
That, like an eagle in a dovecote, I
Float your Volscians in Corioli:
I did it alone. Boy!

AUFIDIUS:
Well, noble lords,
Will you be reminded of his blind fortune,
What was your shame, by this impious braggart,
“For your own eyes and ears?

All the conspirators:
Let him die for this.

Everyone:
“Tear it into pieces.” “Do it now.” 'He killed
my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
Mark. “He killed my father.”

Second Lord:
Peace, ho! no indignation: peace!
The man is noble and his fame is established
This orb of the earth. His latest offenses against us
Must have judicious hearing. Get up, Aufidius,
And don't disturb the peace.

CORIOLANUS:
Oh, if I had it,
With six Aufidius, or more, his tribe,
To use my rightful sword!

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

All the conspirators:
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

Lords:
Hold, hold, hold, hold!

AUFIDIUS:
My noble masters, listen to me speak.

First Lord:
O Tullus,

Second Lord:
You have done an act that will make valor cry.

Third Lord:
Don't step on him. Masters all, be silent;
Put on your swords.

AUFIDIUS:
My lords, when you know, as in this rage,
Provoked by him you cannot - the great danger
What this man's life owed you, you will rejoice
That he is thus cut off. Please, your honors
To call me to your senate, I will deliver to you
Myself your faithful servant, or endure
Your heaviest censorship.

First Lord:
Carry his body from here;
And cry for him: let him be considered
Like the noblest corpse that ever announced
He followed him to his urn.

Second Lord:
His own impatience
He takes much of the blame off Aufidius.
Let's make the most of it.

AUFIDIUS:
My rage is gone;
And I am struck with sadness. Take it.
To help, three of the main soldiers; I will be one.
Beat the drum, so that it speaks sadly:
Follow your steel spikes. Although in this city he
Many people are widowed and childless,
Who mourns the wound at this hour,
However, he will keep a noble memory. To assist.

GLOCKESTER:
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made summer glorious by this York sun;
And all the clouds that invaded our house
Deep within the buried ocean.
Now our foreheads are bound by victorious crowns;
Our bruised arms hung like monuments;
Our severe alarms turned into joyful meetings,
Our terrible steps towards delicious measures.
The grim-faced war has smoothed his wrinkled brow;
And now, instead of riding armored steeds
To frighten the souls of fearful adversaries,
He cavorts nimbly in a lady's bedroom
To the lascivious pleasure of a lute.
But I, who am not made for sporty tricks,
Nor made to court a loving mirror;
Me, who is crudely stamped and who wants the majesty of love
Strutting in front of a wanton and wandering nymph;
I, who am reduced by this just proportion,
Deceived in functionality by hiding nature,
Distorted, unfinished, sent before my time
In this breathing world, barely half made up,
And it's so lame and old fashioned
Let the dogs bark at me when I stop near them;
Why, me, in this time of weak peace,
I have no pleasure in passing the time,
Unless you spy on my shadow in the sun
And I descend upon my own deformity:
And so, since I can't prove that I'm a lover,
To entertain these well-spoken beautiful days,
I'm determined to prove that I'm a bad guy
And I hate vain pleasures these days.
I plotted, inductions are dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, slander and dreams,
To put my brother Clarence and the king
In mortal hatred against each other:
What if King Edward was also true and just
How subtle, false and treacherous I am,
On this day Clarence should be meowed closely,
About a prophecy that says "G"
Among Edward's heirs, the murderer will be.
Dive, thoughts, into my soul: here
Clarence arrives.
Brother, have a good day; what does this armed guard mean
Who is waiting for your grace?

CLARENCE:
His Majesty
To ensure my personal safety, I have appointed
This conduct to take me to the Tower.

GLOCKESTER:
For what cause?

CLARENCE:
Because my name is George.

GLOCKESTER:
Alas, my lord, this fault is not your fault;
To do this, he should engage your sponsors:
O, it seems that His Majesty has an intention
That you will be rebaptized in the Tower.
But what is it, Clarence? can I please know?

CLARENCE:
Yeah, Richard, when I know; because I protest
I do not know it yet: but, as I can learn,
He listens to prophecies and dreams;
And from the transverse row tears off the letter G.
And says a wizard told him that by G
His descendants should be disinherited;
And, because my name George starts with G,
It follows in his thought that I am he.
These, as I learn, and toys like these
I urged His Highness to engage me now.

GLOCKESTER:
Well, this is how men are ruled by women:
It's not the king who sends you to the Tower:
My Lady Grey, his wife, Clarence, is her
That tempers him at that end.
Was it not her and this good man of worship,
Anthony Woodville, his brother there,
This prompted him to send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
Where is it delivered from today?
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.

CLARENCE:
By heaven I think no man is safe
But the queen's parents and the night heralds
This quarrel between the king and Mistress Shore.
Have you not heard what a humble supplicant
Was Lord Hastings with her for her delivery?

GLOCKESTER:
Humbly complain to his divinity
I have obtained my liberty from my lord chamberlain.
I'll tell you what; I think that's our way of doing things,
If we remain in favor of the king,
Be his men and wear his livery:
The jealous and worn-out widow and herself,
Since then, our brother has nicknamed them “gentlemen”.
Are powerful gossips in this monarchy.

FREINBURY:
I beg your graces to forgive me both;
His Majesty directly handed over responsibility
So that no one can have a private conference,
To what degree, with his brother.

GLOCKESTER:
Anyway; and I do not please your adoration, Brakenbury,
You can participate in everything we say:
We're not talking about treason, man: we're talking about the king
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
Well aged, fair and not jealous;
We say Shore's wife has a pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a beautiful eye, a fleeting and pleasant tongue;
And may the queen's parents have become gentle people:
How do you say sir? Can you deny all this?

FREINBURY:
With that, my lord, I have nothing to do.

GLOCKESTER:
Nothing to do with Mistress Shore! I tell you, my friend,
He who does nothing with her, except one,
It was better that he did it in secret, alone.

FREINBURY:
Which one, my lord?

GLOCKESTER:
Her husband, rascal: do you want to betray me?

FREINBURY:
I beg your grace to forgive me, and at the same time
Abstain from your conference with the noble Duke.

CLARENCE:
We know your charge, Brakenbury, and we will obey.

GLOCKESTER:
We are the queen's abjects and must obey.
Brother, farewell: I will do it to the king;
And whatever field you employ me in,
If it was to call King Edward's widowed sister,
I will execute him to free you.
In the meantime, this deep shame in the fraternity
This touches me more deeply than you can imagine.

CLARENCE:
I know none of us like this.

GLOCKESTER:
Well, your imprisonment will not be long;
In the meantime, be patient.

CLARENCE:
I definitely have to. Farewell.

GLOCKESTER:
Go, walk the path from which you will never return.
Clarence simple and clear! I love you so much,
That I will soon send your soul to heaven,
If heaven will take the present into our hands.
But who comes here? the new Hastings delivered?

HASTING:
Have a good time of the day to my gracious lord!

GLOCKESTER:
So much to my good lord chamberlain!
Well, are you welcome outdoors.
How did your Lordship bear the imprisonment?

HASTING:
With patience, noble Lord, as prisoners must:
But I will live, my lord, to give them thanks
This was the cause of my imprisonment.

GLOCKESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; and Clarence too;
For those who were your enemies are his,
And I had as much success with him as with you.

HASTING:
It's even more of a shame that the eagle is meowing,
While kites and buzzards hunt freely.

GLOCKESTER:
What's the news abroad?

HASTING:
There is no news so bad abroad as this at home;
The King is sick, weak and melancholy,
And his doctors fear him greatly.

GLOCKESTER:
Now, by Saint Paul, this news is really bad.
Oh, he's been on a bad diet for a long time,
And he consumed his royal person too much:
It's very painful to think about it.
What, is he in his bed?

HASTING:
He is.

GLOCKESTER:
Go first, and I will follow you.
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
Until George was loaded with post horses to the sky.
I will enter, to further incite his hatred towards Clarence,
With lies well reinforced by weighty arguments;
And if I don't fall into my deep intention,
Clarence doesn't have another day to live:
Which is done, may God take King Edward to his mercy,
And leave the world for me to worry about!
For then I will marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
What if I had killed her husband and her father?
The easiest way to make amends to the girl
It is to become her husband and her father:
Which one am I going to? not so much for love
As for another secret and close intention,
By marrying him, what I must achieve.
And yet I run in front of my horses to the market:
Clarence is still breathing; Edward still lives and reigns:
When they are gone, I will then have to count my winnings.

LADY ANNE:
Lay down, lay down your honorable charge,
If honor can be wrapped in a hearse,
While I lament obsequiously for a while
The premature fall of the virtuous Lancaster.
Poor cold face of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
You, remain bloodless of this royal blood!
May I invoke your ghost,
To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,
Wife of your Edward, of your slain son,
Stabbed by the same hand that caused these wounds!
Here, in these windows which let your life escape,
I pour the helpless balm from my poor eyes.
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
Cursed the blood who let this blood out of here!
An even more terrible misfortune for this hated wretch,
It makes us unhappy with your death,
That I can wish to vipers, to spiders, to toads,
Or any living, poisonous thing!
If he ever has a child, even an aborted one,
Prodigious and inopportune brought to light,
Whose ugly and unnatural appearance
May frighten the hopeful mother at the sight;
And let him be the heir of his misfortune!
If he ever has a wife, let him make her
A wretched by his death
As I am made by my poor lord and you!
Come now to Chertsey with your sacred load,
Taken from Paul to be buried there;
And yet, as you are tired of the weight,
Rest while I lament the corpse of King Henry.

GLOCKESTER:
Stay, you who carry the corpse, and lay it down.

LADY ANNE:
Which black magician evokes this demon,
To stop dedicated acts of charity?

GLOCKESTER:
Wicked men, lay down the corpse; or, by Saint Paul,
I will make a corpse of the one who disobeys.

Gentleman:
My lord, step back and let the coffin pass.

GLOCKESTER:
Dog without manners! stand when I command:
Advance your halberd higher than my chest,
Or, by Saint Paul, I will strike you on the foot,
And reject yourself, beggar, because of your boldness.

LADY ANNE:
What, are you shaking? are you all afraid?
Alas, I don't blame you; because you are mortal,
And mortal eyes cannot bear the devil.
Advance, terrible minister of hell!
You had only power over his mortal body,
You can't have his soul; so leave.

GLOCKESTER:
Sweet saint, for charity’s sake, do not be so accursed.

LADY ANNE:
Infamous devil, for God's sake, then, and don't disturb us;
For you have made the happy earth your hell,
I filled it with abusive cries and deep exclamations.
If you take pleasure in seeing your heinous acts,
Here is this model of your butchers.
Oh, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
Open their frozen mouths and bleed again!
Blush, blush, you are a mass of filthy deformity;
Because it is your presence that exhales this blood
Cold and empty veins, where no blood remains;
Your act, inhuman and unnatural,
Causes this most unnatural flood.
O God, what this blood has done, avenge his death!
O earth, let this blood drink to avenge its death!
Let the sky with lightning strike the
dead murderer,
Or the earth, open wide and eat it quickly,
As you swallow the blood of this good king
That his arm governed by hell has massacred!

GLOCKESTER:
Madam, you know no rule of charity,
Which returns good for evil, blessing for curse.

LADY ANNE:
Wicked, you know no law of God or man:
No beast so ferocious knows a certain amount of mercy.

GLOCKESTER:
But I don't know any of them, and so I'm not stupid.

LADY ANNE:
O wonderful, when the devils speak the truth!

GLOCKESTER:
Even more wonderful, when the angels are so angry.
Guarantee yourself, divine perfection of a woman,
From these so-called evils, to give me leave,
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.

LADY ANNE:
Guarantee a defused infection of a man,
For these known evils, but to give me permission,
By circumstances, to curse your cursed self.

GLOCKESTER:
More beautiful than tongue can name you, let me
A little free time to apologize.

LADY ANNE:
Dirtier than your heart can think you can do
No common excuse but hanging yourself.

GLOCKESTER:
It is through such despair that I should blame myself.

LADY ANNE:
And, in despairing, you should be excused;
For having taken worthy revenge on yourself,
Who committed a shameful massacre on others.

GLOCKESTER:
You say I killed them, right?

LADY ANNE:
Well, then they are not dead:
But they are dead and evil slaves to you.

GLOCKESTER:
I didn't kill your husband.

LADY ANNE:
Well, then he's alive.

GLOCKESTER:
No, he is dead; and slain by the hand of Edward.

LADY ANNE:
In your fetid throat you lie: Queen Marguerite saw
Your murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
The one you once folded against his chest,
But let your brothers dismiss the subject.

GLOCKESTER:
I was provoked by his slanderous tongue,
which placed their guilt on my innocent shoulders.

LADY ANNE:
You were provoked by your damn mind.
Who has only ever dreamed of butcheries:
Didn't you kill this king?

GLOCKESTER:
I grant you.

LADY ANNE:
Will you grant me that, hedgehog? so God grant me too
You can be damned for this bad deed!
Oh, he was gentle, gentle and virtuous!

GLOCKESTER:
He who is best suited to the King of Heaven is he who possesses him.

LADY ANNE:
He is in heaven, where you will never come.

GLOCKESTER:
Let him thank me for helping me send him there;
For he was more fit for this place than the earth.

LADY ANNE:
And you are unfit for any place other than hell.

GLOCKESTER:
Yes, another place, if you hear me name it.

LADY ANNE:
Dungeon.

GLOCKESTER:
Your bedroom.

LADY ANNE:
I will rest near the room where you rest!

GLOCKESTER:
It will be like this, madam, until I sleep with you.

LADY ANNE:
I hope so.

GLOCKESTER:
I know it. But, sweet Lady Anne,
To leave this lively meeting of our minds,
And fall a little into a slower method,
Is he not the cause of timeless deaths?
Among these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
As guilty as the executioner?

LADY ANNE:
You are the most cursed cause and effect.

GLOCKESTER:
Your beauty was the cause of this effect;
Your beauty: which haunted me in my sleep
To undertake the death of the whole world,
So I could live for an hour in your sweet bosom.

LADY ANNE:
If I thought that, I'll tell you, homicide,
These nails should rip this beauty off my cheeks.

GLOCKESTER:
These eyes could never bear the shipwreck of sweet beauty;
You shouldn't ruin it, if I stayed here:
While the whole world is rejoicing in the sun,
So I'm over there; This is my day, my life.

LADY ANNE:
The dark night shades your day, and death your life!

GLOCKESTER:
Do not curse yourself, beautiful creature, you are both.

LADY ANNE:
I would like to take revenge on you.

GLOCKESTER:
It is a most unnatural quarrel,
To take revenge on the one who loves you.

LADY ANNE:
It's a fair and reasonable quarrel,
To take revenge on the one who killed my husband.

GLOCKESTER:
The one who deprived you, madam, of your husband,
I did it to help you find a better husband.

LADY ANNE:
His best does not blow on the earth.

GLOCKESTER:
He lives and loves you better than he could.

LADY ANNE:
Name it.

GLOCKESTER:
Plantagenet.

LADY ANNE:
Well, it was him.

GLOCKESTER:
The same name, but of a better nature.

LADY ANNE:
Where is he?

GLOCKESTER:
Here.
Why are you spitting on me?

LADY ANNE:
Would it be a deadly poison for you!

GLOCKESTER:
Never did poison come from such a sweet place.

LADY ANNE:
I never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight! you infect my eyes.

GLOCKESTER:
Your eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

LADY ANNE:
Could they be basilisks to strike you to death!

GLOCKESTER:
I wish they were, so that I could die immediately;
For now, they're killing me with a living death.
Your eyes drew tears of salt,
Shamed their appearance with a reserve of childish drops:
Those eyes that never shed tears of remorse,
No, when my father York and Edward cried,
To hear the pitiful moan that Rutland uttered
When the black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
Nor when your warrior father, like a child,
I told the sad story of my father's death,
And twenty times I stopped to sob and cry,
That all the spectators had wet their cheeks
Like trees covered in rain: in this sad moment
My manly eyes disdained a humble tear;
And what these sorrows could not exhale from there,
Your beauty made them blind with tears.
I have never pursued a friend or an enemy;
My tongue has never been able to learn a sweet and soothing word;
But now your beauty is offered at my fee,
My proud heart pursues and makes my tongue speak.
Do not teach your lips such contempt, for they were made
For a kiss, madam, not for such contempt.
If your vengeful heart cannot forgive,
Behold, I lend you here this sharp sword;
Please hide in this true bosom.
And let out the soul that adores you,
I expose him naked to the mortal blow,
And humbly beg for death on my knees.
No, don't stop; because I killed King Henry,
But it was your beauty that provoked me.
No, now hurry up; it was I who stabbed young Edward,
But it was your heavenly face that turned me on.
Take back the sword, or take me.

LADY ANNE:
Rise up, dissembler: although I wish you dead,
I will not be the executioner.

GLOCKESTER:
So tell me to kill myself, and I will.

LADY ANNE:
I have already.

GLOCKESTER:
Tush, it was in your anger:
Repeat it, and, even with the word,
This hand which, for your love, killed your love,
Must, for your love, kill a much truer love;
You will be complicit in their two deaths.

LADY ANNE:
I would like to know your heart.

GLOCKESTER:
It's written in my language.

LADY ANNE:
I fear both are false.

GLOCKESTER:
So man has never been true.

LADY ANNE:
Well, raise your sword.

GLOCKESTER:
Say, my peace is made.

LADY ANNE:
You will know this later.

GLOCKESTER:
But should I live in hope?

LADY ANNE:
All men, I hope, live like this.

GLOCKESTER:
Guarantee to wear this ring safely.

LADY ANNE:
Taking is not giving.

GLOCKESTER:
Look how this ring encompasses the finger.
Thus your chest encloses my poor heart;
Wear them both, for they are both yours.
And if your poor devoted supplicant can
But ask a favor of your gracious hand,
You confirm his happiness forever.

LADY ANNE:
What is this?

GLOCKESTER:
That it would please you to leave these sad designs behind
To him who has more reason to mourn,
And currently, go to Crosby Place;
Where, after solemnly burying
In the monastery of Chertsey, this noble king,
And I wet his grave with my repentant tears,
I will see you with all my duty:
For various unknown reasons. I beg you,
Grant me this favor.

LADY ANNE:
With all my heart; and that makes me very happy too,
To see that you have become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, follow me.

GLOCKESTER:
Say goodbye to me.

LADY ANNE:
This is more than you deserve;
But since you teach me to flatter you,
Imagine that I have already said goodbye.

GLOCKESTER:
Gentlemen, take the corpse.

GENTLEMEN:
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?

GLOCKESTER:
No, at White Friars; there witness my strike.
Has a woman of this mood ever been courted?
Has a woman in this humor ever been won?
I will have it ; but I won't keep it for long.
What! I, who killed her husband and her father,
To take her in the most extreme hatred of her heart,
With curses in my mouth, tears in my eyes,
The bloody witness of his hatred by;
Having God, his conscience and these bars
against me,
And I have nothing at all to support my suit,
But the simple devil and the hidden glances,
And yet, to win it, everyone did nothing!
Ha!
Has she already forgotten this brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, about three months ago,
Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
A gentler and more charming gentleman,
Framed in the lavishness of nature,
Young, valiant, wise and undoubtedly royal,
The spacious world can no longer afford
And will she lower her eyes on me again,
This cut off the golden flower of this sweet prince,
And made his widow a terrible bed?
About me, whose all is not equal to half of Edward?
On me, who stops me and am thus informed?
My duchy has a negationist beggar,
I've been getting the wrong person all this time:
On my life she discovers, even though I can't,
Myself for being a wonderful and decent man.
I will be charged for a mirror,
And entertain a score or two of tailors,
To study the ways to adorn my body:
Since I'm in favor of myself,
Will maintain it inexpensively.
But first, I'm going to turn this man over in his grave;
And then come back lamenting for my love.
Shine, beautiful sun, until I have bought a drink,
So that I can see my shadow as I pass by.

RIVERS:
Have patience, madam: there is no doubt about his majesty
Will soon return to usual health.

GRAY:
To the extent you tolerate it, it makes it even worse:
Therefore, for God's sake, have good comfort,
And proclaim his grace with quick and joyful words.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If he were dead, what would become of me?

RIVERS:
No other evil than the loss of such a lord.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The loss of such a lord includes all damages.

GRAY:
The heavens have blessed you with a good son,
To be your comforter when he is gone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, he's young and his minority
Is entrusted to the trust of Richard Gloucester,
A man who doesn't love me, or any of you.

RIVERS:
Is it concluded that he will be protective?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It is determined, not yet concluded:
But it will be like this if the king has a miscarriage.

GRAY:
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.

BUCKINGHAM:
Have a good time of the day to your royal grace!

DERBY:
May God make your majesty as joyful as you have been!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Countess Richmond, my good lord of Derby.
To your good prayers I will hardly say amen.
Yet, Derby, although she is your wife,
And don't love me, be you, good lord, assured
I don't hate you for your proud arrogance.

DERBY:
I beg you, either don't believe
The envious slanders of his false accusers;
Or, if she is accused according to a true report,
Bear with his weakness, which I think continues
Of a capricious illness and of no founded malice.

RIVERS:
Have you seen the king today, my lord of Derby?

DERBY:
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Came to visit his majesty.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How likely is his amendment, my lords?

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks joyfully.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant him health! Did you talk with him?

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, we have done it: he wishes to make atonement
Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
And between them and my lord chamberlain;
And he sent them to warn them of his royal presence.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If everything went well! but that will never be the case
I fear our happiness is at its highest.

GLOCKESTER:
They hurt me, and I won't stand it:
Who are they who complain to the king,
That, in truth, I am severe and that I don't like them?
By Saint Paul, they love his grace but lightly
It fills his ears with such discordant rumors.
Because I can't flatter and speak fair,
Smile on the faces of men, smooth, deceptive and cogwheel,
Duck with French nods and the courtesy of monkeys,
I must be considered a spiteful enemy.
Can't a simple man live without thinking of evil,
But we must therefore abuse its simple truth
By silky, sly, insinuating Jacks?

RIVERS:
To whom, in all this presence, does your grace speak?

GLOCKESTER:
For you, this has neither honesty nor grace.
When did I hurt you? when did you wrong yourself?
Or you ? or you ? or a member of your faction?
A plague on you all! His royal person,...
May God preserve better than you wish!
I can't stay silent just to breathe,
But you have to bother him with obscene complaints.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Brother of Gloucester, you are wrong.
The king, by his own royal disposition,
And not provoked by any other pretender;
Aiming, it seems, at your inner hatred,
What manifests itself in your external actions
Against my family, my brothers and myself,
Has it sent; so that he can thus gather
The motive of your ill will, and so remove it.

GLOCKESTER:
I can't say it: the world has become so bad,
That troglodytes prey where eagles do not dare to perch:
Since every Jack became a gentleman
There are many sweet people who have made a Jack.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come on, come on, we know what you mean, brother
Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and that of my friends:
God grant that we never need you!

GLOCKESTER:
In the meantime, God grant that we may need you:
Your brother is imprisoned by your means,
Myself dishonored and the nobility
Held in contempt; while many fair promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
These rare items, about two days ago, were worth a noble.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By Him who raised me to this prudent height
Of this happy happiness that I enjoyed,
I have never praised his majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence, but were
A serious advocate to argue in his favor.
My lord, you do me a shameful wrong,
Falsely to lure me to these vile suspects.

GLOCKESTER:
You can deny that you are not the cause
Of the late imprisonment of Lord Hastings.

RIVERS:
She can, my lord, for...

GLOCKESTER:
She can, Lord Rivers! why, who doesn't know?
She can do more, sir, than deny this:
It can help you get many fair preferences,
And then refuse him his help,
And attribute these honors to your high merits.
What can't she do? She can, yes, marry, can she...

RIVERS:
What, can she get married?

GLOCKESTER:
What, marry, may she! marry a king,
A single man, a handsome teenager too:
I think your grandmother had a worse game.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My Lord of Gloucester, I have endured too long
Your brutal reprimands and bitter mockery:
By heaven I will make known to his majesty
With these crude taunts that I often endured.
I'd rather be a country servant
That a great queen, in this state,
To be mocked, scorned and harassed in this way:
I'm not very happy being the Queen of England.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
And the reduction would be so minimal, my God, I beg you!
Your honor, your state and your seat are owed to me.

GLOCKESTER:
What! Are you threatening me to talk about the king?
Tell him, and don't spare him: look, what I said
I will testify in the presence of the king:
I dare the adventure to be sent to the Tower.
It is time to speak; my pains are completely forgotten.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Out, devil! I remember it too well:
You killed my husband Henry in the Tower,
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.

GLOCKESTER:
Before you were queen, yes, or your husband was king,
I was a workhorse in his great affairs;
An eliminator of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends:
To royalize his blood, I shed mine.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Yes, and much better blood than his or yours.

GLOCKESTER:
All this time, you and your husband Gray
We were partisans of the House of Lancaster;
And Rivers, you too. He wasn't your husband
In the battle of Marguerite at Saint Alban, killed?
Let me remind you, if you forget,
What you were before now and what you are;
With everything I have been and what I am.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
A wicked murderer, and you still are.

GLOCKESTER:
Poor Clarence abandoned his father, Warwick;
Yes, and he renounced himself, which Jesus forgives!

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
What vengeance from God!

GLOCKESTER:
Fighting with Edward's party for the crown;
And for his salary, poor lord, he is meowed.
I wish my heart were made of flint, like Edward's;
Or Edward is sweet and pitiful, like mine
I am too childish and stupid for this world.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Go to hell for shame and leave the world,
You, cacodemon! there is your kingdom.

RIVERS:
Monsignor of Gloucester, in these busy days
That you ask us here to prove that we are enemies,
We then followed our lord, our rightful king:
And so would we, if you were to be our king.

GLOCKESTER:
If I had to be! I would rather be a peddler:
Far from my heart this thought!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should take advantage of it, if you were the king of this country,
As little joy as you can suppose in me.
I like it, being the queen.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
The queen enjoyed a little joy;
Because I am her, and absolutely joyless.
I can't be patient anymore.
Listen to me, you pirates in conflict, who argue
By sharing what you took from me!
Which one of you doesn't tremble when looking at me?
Otherwise, being a queen, you bow like subjects,
Yet, because you have been deposed, you tremble like rebels?
O sweet villain, do not turn away!

GLOCKESTER:
Infamous wrinkled witch, what are you doing in my eyes?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
But repetition of what you have wasted;
That's what I'll do before I let you go.

GLOCKESTER:
Have you not been banished under penalty of death?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
I was; but I find more pain in banishment
That death can bring me back here near my home.
You owe me a husband and a son;
And you a kingdom; your allegiance to all:
The sorrow I feel is by right yours,
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

GLOCKESTER:
The curse that my noble father imposed on you,
When you crowned his warrior eyebrows with paper
And with your contempt you drew rivers from his eyes,
And then, to dry them, he gave weight to the duke
Imbued with the impeccable blood of the pretty Rutland...
His curses, then from the bitterness of the soul
Denounced against you, all fall on you;
And it was God, not us, who tormented your bloody deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God is therefore just to right the innocent.

HASTING:
Oh, it was the most despicable act to kill that baby,
And the most ruthless one you've ever heard of!

RIVERS:
The tyrants themselves cried when this was reported.

DORSET:
No one prophesied his revenge.

BUCKINGHAM:
Northumberland, then present, wept when he saw him.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
What were you scolding before my arrival,
Ready to take each other by the throat,
And you turn all your hatred now on me?
Has the terrible curse of York prevailed so much in heaven?
That the death of Henry, the death of my adorable Edward,
The loss of their kingdom, my sad banishment,
Could everyone answer for this sullen kid?
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter the sky?
Why then do you yield, dark clouds, to my rapid curses!
If not by war, it is by excess that your king will die,
Like ours by murder, to make him a king!
Edward, your son, who is now Prince of Wales,
For Edward, my son, who was Prince of Wales,
To die in one's youth through such untimely violence!
You yourself are a queen, for me it was a queen,
Survive your glory, like my miserable self!
May you live long to mourn the loss of your children;
And see another, as I see you now,
Adorned with your rights, just as you are blocked from mine!
Long die your happy days before your death;
And after long hours of sorrow,
Do not die, neither mother, nor wife, nor Queen of England!
Rivers and Dorset, you were there,
And you too, Lord Hastings, when my son
Was stabbed with bloody daggers: God, I pray,
So that none of you lives out his natural age,
But by an unexpected accident, cut off!

GLOCKESTER:
You have done your charm, odious withered witch!

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
And forget you? stay, dog, because you will listen to me.
If the sky has a serious plague in store
Beyond those I can wish for you,
Oh, let them keep it until your sins are ripe,
And then reject their indignation
On you, the disturber of the peace of the poor world!
The worm of conscience is still gnawing at your soul!
Your friends suspect traitors while you live,
And take deep traitors for your dearest friends!
No sleep, close your mortal eye,
Unless it's during a tormenting dream
It scares you with one hell of bad devils!
You, elf-marked, aborted and rooted pig!
You who were sealed in your nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
You, slander of your mother's heavy belly!
You hated the issues from your father's loins!
You, rag of honor! you hated...

GLOCKESTER:
Daisy.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Richard!

GLOCKESTER:
Ha!

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
I'm not calling you.

GLOCKESTER:
So I cry out to you for mercy, for I had thought
That you called me all those bitter names.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Well, that's what I did; but I wasn't expecting any response.
Oh, let me end my curse!

GLOCKESTER:
“I made it and it ends with 'Margaret.'

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have you uttered your curse against yourself.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Poor painted queen, vain flourishing of my fortune!
Why are you pouring sugar on this bottle spider,
What mortal web are you entangled in?
Stupid, stupid! you sharpen a knife to kill yourself.
The time will come when you will wish me
To help you curse that poisonous toad.

HASTING:
Woman of ill omen, end your frenzied curse,
Lest you strain our patience.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Shame on you ! you all moved mine.

RIVERS:
If you were well served, you would learn your duty.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
To serve me well, you should all do my duty to me,
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
O, serve me well, and teach yourself this duty!

DORSET:
Don't argue with her; she is crazy.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Peace, master marquis, you are malapert:
Your brand new seal of honor is barely current.
O, that your young nobility may judge
What it was like to lose him and be unhappy!
Those who stand on high have many breaths to shake them;
And if they fall, they break into pieces.

GLOCKESTER:
Good advice, get married: learn it, learn it, marquis.

DORSET:
This affects you, my lord, as much as it does me.

GLOCKESTER:
Yes, and much more: but I was born so high,
Our area is built at the top of the cedar,
And he mocks the wind and despises the sun.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
And turns the sun into shadow; Alas! Alas!
Witness my son, now in the shadow of death;
Whose bright rays of your cloudy anger
Withdrew into eternal darkness.
Your area is built in the nest of our area.
O God, who sees this, do not suffer it!
As it was won with blood, so may it be lost!

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done! out of shame, if not out of charity.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Advise me neither charity nor shame:
You have dealt with me uncharitably,
And shamefully, because of you, my hopes are massacred.
My charity is an outrage, life my shame
And in this shame still lives the rage of my sorrow.

BUCKINGHAM:
I did, I did.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
O princely Buckingham, I will kiss your hand,
As a sign of league and friendship with you:
Now it's just for you and your noble house!
Your clothes are not stained with our blood,
Nor you within the perimeter of my curse.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nor anyone here; because curses never pass
The lips of those who breathe them in the air.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
I won't believe it but they go up to heaven,
And there the sweet sleeping peace of God awakens.
O Buckingham, beware of that dog!
Look, when he flatters, he bites; and when he bites,
Her venom tooth will irritate her to the point of death:
Don't deal with him, beware of him;
Sin, death and hell have marked him with their marks,
And all their ministers served him.

GLOCKESTER:
What does she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing I respect, my gracious lord.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
What, do you despise me for my gentle advice?
And appease the devil I warn you against?
O, but remember that another day,
When he breaks your heart with sorrow,
And say that poor Margaret was a prophetess!
Live each of you subject to his hatred,
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!

HASTING:
My hair stands up to hear his curses.

RIVERS:
And mine too: I wonder why she is free.

GLOCKESTER:
I can't blame him: by the holy mother of God,
She was too wrong; and I repent
My part that I did to him.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I've never done it to him, to my knowledge.

GLOCKESTER:
But you are completely wrong about her.
I was too hot to do anyone any good,
It's too cold to think about it now.
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well rewarded,
He is frankly fattened for his pain
God forgives those who cause it!

RIVERS:
A virtuous and Christian conclusion,
Pray for those who have hurt us.

GLOCKESTER:
And me too :
be well advised.
For if I had cursed now, I had cursed myself.

CATESBY:
Madam, his majesty is calling you,
And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Catesby, we are coming. Lords, will you come with us?

RIVERS:
Madam, we will attend your pardon.

GLOCKESTER:
I do bad and start fighting first.
The secret misdeeds I've committed
I leave myself to the heavy responsibility of others.
Clarence, whom I have indeed laid down in darkness,
I cry to many simple seagulls
Namely, at Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
And say it's the queen and her allies
This raises the king against the duke, my brother.
Well, they believe it; and at the same time sharpens me
To get revenge on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of writing,
Tell them that God commands us to do good for evil:
And so I dress my naked villain
With weird old endings stolen from the holy scriptures;
And I look like a saint, while I play the devil the most.
But sweet ! here are my executioners.
Well, my robust and resolute friends!
Are you now going to expedite this act?

First murderer:
We are, my lord; and come get the money order
So that we may be admitted where he is.

GLOCKESTER:
Well thought; I have it here about me.
When you're done, head to Crosby Place.
But, gentlemen, be abrupt in your execution,
Despite your obstinacy, do not hear him plead;
Because Clarence expresses himself well, and perhaps
It might bring pity to your hearts if you mark it.

First murderer:
Poof!
Do not be afraid, my lord, we cannot bear to talk;
Talkers don't do good deeds: rest assured
We come to use our hands and not our tongue.

GLOCKESTER:
Your eyes drop millstones, when the eyes of fools drop tears:
I like you guys; about your business directly;
Come on, come on, hurry up.

First murderer:
We will, my noble lord.

FREINBURY:
Why is Your Grace looking so heavily today?

CLARENCE:
O, I spent a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of horrible dreams,
As I am a faithful and Christian man,
I won't spend another night like this,
Even if it was to buy a world of happy days,
The times were so full of gloomy terror!

FREINBURY:
What was your dream? I can't wait to hear you say it.

CLARENCE:
I thought I was out of the Tower,
And was embarked to pass through Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
On the hatches: from there we looked towards England,
And quoted a thousand times frighteningly,
During the York and Lancaster Wars
This had happened to us. As we walked
On the dizzying foot of the hatches,
It seemed to me that Gloucester had stumbled; and, falling,
It struck me, this thought of remaining there, overboard,
In the tumultuous waves of the main one.
Lord, Lord! I thought, what pain it was to drown!
What a terrible sound of water in my ears!
What horrible visions of death in my eyes!
It seemed to me that I had seen a thousand terrifying wrecks;
Ten thousand men who fish are eaten away;
Quarters of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearls,
Priceless stones, worthless jewels,
All scattered at the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in the skulls of the dead; and, in these holes
Where eyes once dwelt they crept,
As if we despise the eyes, reflecting the precious stones,
Who courted the slimy bottom of the depths,
And he didn't care about the scattered dead bones.

FREINBURY:
Did you have so much leisure at the time of death
Contemplate the secrets of the depths?

CLARENCE:
I thought that was the case; and often I have strived
Give in the ghost: but still the envious flow
Kept in my soul, and I won't let it out
Seek the empty air, vast and wandering;
But I smothered it in my panting mass,
Which almost burst and threw it back into the sea.

FREINBURY:
Didn't you wake up with this painful agony?

CLARENCE:
no, my dream continued after life;
Oh, then began the storm on my soul,
Who passed, I thought, the melancholy flow,
With this sinister ferryman of whom the poets speak,
In the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first who greeted my foreign soul there,
Was my great-father-in-law, the famous Warwick;
Who cried out loud: “What a scourge for perjurer
Can this dark monarchy afford the fake Clarence?
And so he disappeared: then he came wandering that way
A shadow like an angel, with shiny hair
Tasted with blood; and he cried out loud,
“Clarence came; Clarence false, ephemeral and perjured,
It stabbed me in the field near Tewksbury;
Seize him, Furies, take him to your torments!
With this, I thought, a legion of evil demons
Surrounded me and screamed in my ears
Screams so hideous, that with the very noise
I woke up shaking, and for a season afterwards
I couldn't believe I was in hell,
Such a terrible impression made the dream.

FREINBURY:
It is not surprising, my lord, even if it frightened you;
I promise you, I'm afraid to hear you say it.

CLARENCE:
O Brakenbury, I have done these things,
Who now testify against my soul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he rewards me!
Oh my God! if my deep prayers cannot soothe you,
But you will take revenge for my misdeeds,
But execute your anger in me alone,
O, spare my innocent wife and my poor children!
I pray you, sweet guardian, stay close to me;
My soul is heavy and I would like to sleep.

FREINBURY:
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
Grief breaks seasons and hours of rest,
Does the night in the morning and the night at noon.
Princes have only their tides for their glory,
An external honor for an internal work;
And, for an imagination not felt,
They often feel a world of restless worries:
So that, between their tides and their low names,
There is nothing different except external fame.

First murderer:
Ho! Who is here?

FREINBURY:
What in God's name are you and how did you get here?

First murderer:
I wanted to speak with Clarence, and I came here on my feet.

FREINBURY:
Yeah, are you so brief?

Second murderer:
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. To show
him our commission; do not speak anymore.

FREINBURY:
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence in your hands:
I will not argue about what is meant by that,
Because I will be innocent of meaning.
Here are the keys, the duke sleeps there:
I am going to the king; and tells him
This is how I renounced my charge to you.

First murderer:
Do it, it's a matter of wisdom: good luck.

Second murderer:
What, are we stabbing him while he sleeps?

First murderer:
No; then he will say it was cowardly, when he wakes up.

Second murderer:
When he wakes up ! why, fool, he will never wake up until
the day of judgment.

First murderer:
Well, then he will say that we stabbed him in his sleep.

Second murderer:
The insistence of this word “judgment” has generated a sort of
of remorse in me.

First murderer:
What, are you afraid?

Second murderer:
Not to kill him, having a warrant for his arrest; but be
damned for having killed him, against whom no warrant can defend us.

First murderer:
I thought you were solved.

Second murderer:
This is what I do, to let him live.

First murderer:
Let's go back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him.

Second murderer:
Please stay a moment: I hope my holy mood
will change; it used to hold me back but while we
I would say twenty.

First murderer:
How do you feel now ?

Second murderer:
"My faith, certain remnants of conscience are still
in me.

First murderer:
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.

Second murderer:
“Zounds, he dies: I forgot the reward.

First murderer:
Where is your conscience now?

Second murderer:
In the purse of the Duke of Gloucester.

First murderer:
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
your conscience flies away.

Second murderer:
Let go; there are few or none that will entertain him.

First murderer:
What if it came back to you?

Second murderer:
I will not get involved: it is a dangerous thing: that
makes man a coward: a man cannot fly, but he
accuses him; he cannot swear, but that stops him;
he cannot sleep with his neighbor's wife, but
detects it: it is a shameful and blushing spirit which
mutinies in a man's breast; it fills a lot of
obstacles: this made me once restore a gold purse
that I found; he begs every man who keeps him: he
is expelled from all cities for a
dangerous thing; and every man who wants to live
well strives to trust and live
without this.

First murderer:
'Zounds, he's still by my side now, persuading me
don't kill the duke.

Second murderer:
Take the devil in your mind and do not relieve him: he
I would like to insinuate with you, but to make you sigh.

First murderer:
But I'm strong, he can't get the better of me,
I guarantee it.

Second murderer:
He spoke like a guy who respected his
reputation. Come, shall we go to this equipment?

First murderer:
Take it on the suit with the handles of your
the sword, and then we will cut it in the butt of Malvasia
In the next room.

Second murderer:
O excellent design! do something stupid to him.

First murderer:
Listen ! he stirs: should I knock?

Second murderer:
No, let's reason it out first.

CLARENCE:
Where are you, guardian? give me a cup of wine.

Second murderer:
You will soon have enough wine, my lord.

CLARENCE:
What in the name of God are you?

Second murderer:
A man, like you.

CLARENCE:
But not, as I am, royal.

Second murderer:
Nor you, like us, faithful.

CLARENCE:
Your voice is thunderous, but your looks are humble.

Second murderer:
My voice is now that of the king, my appearance is my own.

CLARENCE:
How dark and deadly you speak!
Your eyes threaten me: why are you pale?
Who sent you here? Why are you coming?

Both:
To, to, to...

CLARENCE:
To murder me?

Both:
Aouch aouch.

CLARENCE:
You barely have the heart to tell me,
And so I can't have the heart to do it.
How, my friends, have I offended you?

First murderer:
You have not offended us, but the king.

CLARENCE:
I will reconcile with him again.

Second murderer:
Never, my lord; so prepare to die.

CLARENCE:
Are you called to come out of a man's world
To kill innocent people? What is my offense?
Where is the evidence that accuses me?
What legitimate quest has delivered its verdict
To the sullen judge? or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence's death?
Before being condemned by the law,
Threatening me with death is completely illegal.
I charge you, because you hope to have redemption
By the dear blood of Christ shed for our grave sins,
That you leave and don't lay your hand on me
The act you are undertaking is damnable.

First murderer:
What we will do, we do to order.

Second murderer:
And the one who commanded is the king.

CLARENCE:
Wrong vassal! the great king of kings
Has he ordained in the tables of his law
That thou shalt not commit murder: and therefore shalt thou do it,
Reject his edict and fulfill a man's?
Take care; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
To cast down on their heads those who break his law.

Second murderer:
And it is this same vengeance that he launches on you,
For perjury and for murder also:
You have received the holy sacrament,
Fighting in the House of Lancaster feud.

First murderer:
And, like a traitor in the name of God,
Did you break that vow? and with your treacherous blade
Get rid of the entrails of your sovereign's son.

Second murderer:
Whom you swore to cherish and defend.

First murderer:
How can you insist on the terrible law of God,
When did you break it this bad?

CLARENCE:
Alas! for whom did I commit this evil deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for him: well, gentlemen,
He sent you so as not to murder me for this
Because in this sin he is as deep as I am.
If God wants revenge for this act.
Oh, I still know you, he does it publicly,
Do not take away strife from his mighty arm;
He doesn't need any indirect or illegal route
To cut off those who offended him.

First murderer:
Who made you a damn minister,
When the courageous Plantagenêt rushes,
This princely novice was beaten to death by you?

CLARENCE:
My brother's love, the devil and my rage.

First murderer:
Your brother's love, our duty and your fault,
Provoke us here now to slaughter you.

CLARENCE:
Oh, if you love my brother, don't hate me;
I'm his brother and I like him.
If you're hired for me, go back,
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who will reward you better for my life
That Edward will do it for the news of my death.

Second murderer:
You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.

CLARENCE:
no, he loves me and he cares about me:
Go to him for me.

Both:
Yes, we will.

CLARENCE:
Tell him when our princely father York
Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm,
And charged us with his soul to love us,
He hardly thought about this divided friendship:
Tell Gloucester to think about it, and he'll cry.

First murderer:
Yes, millstones; how it taught us to cry.

CLARENCE:
Oh, don't slander him, for he is good.

First murderer:
RIGHT,
Like snow harvests. You are deceiving yourself:
He's the one who sent us here now to slaughter you.

CLARENCE:
It can not be; because when I separated from him,
He hugged me and sobbed:
That he would work on my delivery.

Second murderer:
Well that's what he does, now he delivers you
From the servitude of this world to the joys of heaven.

First murderer:
Make your peace with God, for you must die, my lord.

CLARENCE:
Do you have this sacred feeling in your soul,
To advise me to make peace with God,
And yet you are so blind to your soul,
That you will make war on God by killing me?
Ah, gentlemen, think about who started you
Doing this act will make you hate for this act.

Second murderer:
What will we do ?

CLARENCE:
Give up and save your souls.

First murderer:
Give up! it's loose and feminine.

CLARENCE:
Not giving in is bestial, savage, diabolical.
Which of you, if you were the son of a prince,
Being turned away from freedom, as I am now,
if two murderers like you came to you,
Wouldn't you beg for life?
My friend, I see pity in your eyes:
O, if your eye is not more flattering,
Come to my side and beg for me,
As you would beg, were you in my distress
A beggar prince, what beggar does not have pity?

Second murderer:
Look behind you, my lord.

First murderer:
Take this, and this: if all this is not enough,
I'm going to drown you in Malvasia's ass inside.

Second murderer:
A bloody and desperately executed act!
Like Pilate, I would wash my hands
Of this most serious guilty murder committed!

First murderer:
How now! what do you mean, not to help me?
By heaven, the Duke will know how lazy you are!

Second murderer:
I wish he knew I saved his brother!
Take the prize, and tell him what I say;
For I repent of having killed the duke.

First murderer:
Me neither: leave, coward as you are.
Now must I hide his body in a hole,
Until the Duke orders his burial:
And when I have my meal, I must go;
Because it will disappear, and I must not stay here.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then: I have now done a good day's work:
You, peers, continue this united league:
I wait every day for an embassy
From my Redeemer to redeem me from now on;
And now, in peace, my soul will part from heaven,
Since I put my friends at peace on earth.
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hands;
Don't hide your hatred, swear your love.

RIVERS:
By heaven, my heart is purged of reluctant hatred:
And with my hand I seal the true love of my heart.

HASTING:
So I flourish, as I sincerely swear!

KING EDWARD IV:
Take care not to linger before your king;
Lest he who is the supreme king of kings
Confound your hidden lie and reward
One of you has to be the end of the other.

HASTING:
Then I prosper, because I swear perfect love!

RIVERS:
And I, how I love Hastings with all my heart!

KING EDWARD IV:
Madam, you are not exempt from this,
Neither your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
You have been factional against each other,
Woman, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
And what you do, do it without pretense.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, Hastings; I will never remember it again
Our ancient hatred, so prosper me and mine!

KING EDWARD IV:
Dorset, kiss him; Hastings, I love Lord Marquess.

DORSET:
This exchange of love, I protest here,
For my part, I will be inviolable.

HASTING:
And so I swear, my lord

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, Prince Buckingham, seal this league
With your embraces towards my wife's allies,
And make me happy in your unity.

BUCKINGHAM:
Every time Buckingham turns his hatred
On you or yours,
but with all my love
I cherish you and yours, God punishes me
With hatred in those where I expect the most love!
When I most need to employ a friend,
And I'm assured he's a friend
Deep, hollow, treacherous and full of cunning,
Be it for me! this is what I beg God,
When I am cold in zeal towards yours.

KING EDWARD IV:
A friendly, princely and cordial Buckingham,
is this your wish towards my sick heart.
He now wants our brother Gloucester here,
To make the perfect period of this peace.

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in time, here comes the noble duke.

GLOCKESTER:
Hello to my sovereign king and queen:
And, princely peers, a happy moment of the day!

KING EDWARD IV:
Happy, indeed, for we made it through the day.
Brother, we have done acts of charity;
Make peace out of enmity, righteous love out of hatred,
Between these wrongly inflated and irritated peers.

GLOCKESTER:
Blessed work, my very sovereign overlord:
Among this princely pile, if there are any here,
Through false information or erroneous assumptions,
Consider me an enemy;
If, involuntarily or in my rage,
Having committed something that is barely tolerated
By anyone in this presence, I desire
To reconcile myself with his friendly peace:
It is death for me to be at enmity;
I hate it and I desire the love of all good men.
First, Madam, I implore you for true peace,
Which I will purchase with my devoted service;
From you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
If ever any rancor should arise between us;
Of you, Lord Rivers, and Lord Grey, of you;
Those who, without merit, disapproved of me;
Dukes, counts, lords, gentlemen; in fact, of all of them.
I don't know this living Englishman
With whom my soul disagrees
More than the child who is born tonight
I thank my God for my humility.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A holy day will henceforth be observed:
I would like all conflicts to be well combined.
My sovereign liege, I implore Your Majesty
To bring our brother Clarence to your grace.

GLOCKESTER:
Why, ma'am, did I offer love for this
To be so excited in this royal presence?
Who does not know that the noble duke is dead?
You hurt him to despise his corpse.

RIVERS:
Who doesn't know he's dead! who knows he is?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All seeing the sky, what a world this is!

BUCKINGHAM:
You see, I am so pale, Lord Dorset, like the others?

DORSET:
Yes, my good lord; and no one in this presence
But the red color has left his cheeks.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.

GLOCKESTER:
But he, poor soul, died at your first command,
And that a winged Mercury wore:
A late invalid carried the counter-order,
It was too late to see him buried.
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
Closer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
Deserves no worse than miserable Clarence,
And yet, be aware of suspicion!

DORSET:
A boon, my sovereign, for my accomplished service!

KING EDWARD IV:
I pray to you, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.

DORSET:
I will not get up, unless Your Highness allows it.

KING EDWARD IV:
So say what you ask right away.

DORSET:
The sovereign crime of the life of my servant;
Who killed a righteous man today
Lately servant of the Duke of Norfolk.

KING EDWARD IV:
Have a tongue to condemn the death of my brother,
And will he pardon a slave?
My brother has not killed any man; his fault was thought,
And yet his punishment was a cruel death.
Who sued me for him? who, in my anger,
I knelt at my feet and asked me to be informed
Who talked about brotherhood? who spoke of love?
Who told me how the poor soul gave up
Mighty Warwick, and did he fight for me?
Who told me, on the ground near Tewksbury
When Oxford knocked me down, he saved me.
And he said: “Dear brother, live and be king”?
Who told me, when we were both lying on the field
Frozen almost to death, how he played a trick on me
Even in his own clothes, and gave himself,
All skinny and naked, in the cold, numb night?
It all comes from my memory, brutal anger
Sin, snatched, and not one of you
I had so much grace to put it in my mind.
But when your carters or your waiting vassals
I made a drunken and degraded massacre
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
You are straight on your knees to ask for forgiveness, forgiveness;
And I too, unfairly, must grant it to you
But for my brother no man would speak,
And I, unsightly, don't talk to myself
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
I observed him in his life;
Yet none of you would plead for your life.
O God, I fear that your justice will take hold
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for that!
Come, Hastings, help me get to my closet.
Oh, poor Clarence!

GLOCKESTER:
It’s the fruit of temerity! You didn't score
How the guilty parents of the queen
Did you look pale when they heard of Clarence's death?
Oh, they insisted it to the king again!
God will avenge him. But come, let us in,
To comfort Edward with our company.

BUCKINGHAM:
We await your grace.

Boy:
Tell me, good grandmother, is our father dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No boy.

Boy:
Why do you wring your hands and beat your chest,
And cry: “O Clarence, my unfortunate son!

Girl:
Why do you look at us and shake your head,
And treat us as miserable, orphans, shipwrecked
If our noble father is alive?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My pretty cousins, you deceive me a lot;
I deplore the king's illness.
How I hate to lose him, not your father's death;
It was a lost sorrow to mourn the lost.

Boy:
So, grandmother, you conclude that he is dead.
The king my uncle is responsible for this:
God will avenge him; that I will bother
With daily prayers to this effect.

Girl:
And me too.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, children, peace! the king likes you:
Incompetent and superficial innocents,
You can't guess who caused your father's death.

Boy:
Grandma, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
Said to me, the king, provoked by the queen,
Indictments designed to imprison him:
And when my uncle told me, he cried,
And he hugged me and kissed me kindly on the cheek;
Asked me to count on him as on my father,
And he would love me very much as his child.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Oh, this deception should steal such sweet forms,
And with a virtuous vizard, hide a dastardly ruse!
It's my son; yes, and that is my shame;
However, he did not draw this deception from my hiding places.

Boy:
Do you think my uncle was faking it, grandmother?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Yes, my boy.

Boy:
I can't think so. Listen ! what noise is that?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, who will stop me from moaning and crying,
To scold my fortune and torment me?
I will join in the black despair against my soul,
And become an enemy to me.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What does this scene of gross impatience mean?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To commit an act of tragic violence:
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
Why grow branches now that the root has withered?
Why don't the leaves wither when the sap is gone?
If you want to live, deplore yourself; if I die, be brief,
So that our swift-winged souls may catch those of the king;
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
Towards his new kingdom of perpetual rest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ah, I care so much about your sorrow
What a title I had in your noble husband!
I mourned the death of a worthy husband,
And lived looking at his images:
But now two mirrors of her princely appearance
Are broken to pieces by a malignant death,
And for my comfort, I only have one false glass,
Which saddens me when I see my shame in him.
You are a widow; yet you are a mother,
And the comfort of your children has left you:
But death tore my husband from my arms,
And I tore two crutches from my weak limbs,
Edward and Clarence. O, what reason have I,
Your being is only half of my sorrow,
To overcome your complaints and drown your cries!

Boy:
Good aunt, you did not mourn the death of our father;
How can we help you with our sister tears?

Girl:
Our fatherless distress was not mourned;
Nor may your widow's grief be mourned!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Give me no help in my lamentations;
I am not incapable of filing a complaint
All sources reduce their currents in my eyes,
That I, being ruled by the watery moon,
May we send abundant tears to drown the world!
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!

Children:
Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas for both, mine, Edward and Clarence!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What vacation did I have besides Edward? and he left.

Children:
What stay did we have other than Clarence? and he left.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What remains did I have besides them? and they left.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Never has a widow suffered such a dear loss!

Children:
Never have orphans suffered such a dear loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Never has a mother suffered such a dear loss!
Alas, I am the mother of these groans!
Their misfortunes are grouped, mine are general.
She cries for an Edward, and so do I;
I cry for Clarence, and neither does she:
These babies cry for Clarence and me too;
I, for an Edward, I cry, they too:
Alas, you three, on me, triple afflicted,
Shed all your tears! I am the nurse of your sorrow,
And I will pamper him with lamentations.

DORSET:
Comfort, dear mother: God is very displeased
That you take his fact with ingratitude:
In the common things of the world this is called ungrateful,
With a secret reluctance to repay a debt
Which, with a generous hand, was kindly lent;
Much more to be thus opposed to heaven,
Because he needs the royal debt that he lent you.

RIVERS:
Madam, think of yourself, like a prudent mother,
Of the young prince your son: send for him immediately
Let him be crowned; in him lives your comfort:
Drowning the desperate sorrow in Edward's dead grave,
And plant your joys living on Edward's throne.

GLOCKESTER:
Madam, rest assured: we all have a cause
To mourn the diminishing of our bright star;
But no one can cure their ills by crying over them.
Madam, my mother, I cry out to you for mercy;
I have not seen your grace: humbly on my knees
I need your blessing.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
God bless you ; and put sweetness in your mind,
Love, charity, obedience and true duty!

GLOCKESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
You troubled princes and sad-hearted peers,
Who bear this heavy mutual burden of groans,
Now encourage one another in love for one another
Although we have spent our harvest from this king,
We must reap the harvest of his son.
The broken grudge of your swollen hearts,
But lately burst, knitted and reunited,
Should be delicately preserved, cherished and preserved:
It seems good to me, with a little train,
Let the young prince be fetched immediately from Ludlow
Here in London, to be crowned our king.

RIVERS:
Why with a little train, my lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my lord, lest by multitude
The newly healed wound of wickedness should burst forth,
Which would be all the more dangerous
How green and yet ungoverned is the domain:
Where each horse carries its reins,
And can direct his own course as he pleases,
Both the fear of harm and the apparent harm,
In my opinion this should be avoided.

GLOCKESTER:
I hope the king has made peace with us all
And the pact is firm and true in me.

RIVERS:
And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
However, as it is only green, it should be put
In the absence of an apparent likelihood of violation,
What many people might suggest:
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
It is fitting that so few people go looking for the prince.

HASTING:
And that's what I'm saying.

GLOCKESTER:
So be it ; and off we go to determine
Who they will be and who will be immediately posted to Ludlow.
Madam, and you, my mother, are you going to go
To give your censures in this heavy affair?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
With all our hearts.

BUCKINGHAM:
Monsignor, whoever goes to the Prince,
For God's sake, let's not leave us both behind;
Because, by the way, I will sort out the opportunities,
As an index of the story we talked about later,
Separating the proud parents of the queen from the king.

GLOCKESTER:
My other self, the consistory of my council,
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
Like a child, I will follow your direction.
Direction Ludlow then, because we will not stay behind.

First citizen:
Neighbor, well met: where to go so quickly?

Second citizen:
I promise you, I barely know it myself:
Do you hear the news abroad?

First citizen:
Yes, the king is dead.

Second citizen:
Bad news, by madam; it's rarely the best:
I fear, I fear it will be a troubled world.

Third citizen:
Neighbors, good God!

First citizen:
Hello Sir.

Third citizen:
Does this news confirm the death of good King Edward?

Second citizen:
Yes, sir, it is too true; God help for now!

Third citizen:
So, masters, look at a troubled world.

First citizen:
No no; by the good grace of God, his son will reign.

Third citizen:
Woe to the country governed by a child!

Second citizen:
In him there is a hope of government,
That in his council of nonage under him,
And in his full and ripe years himself,
Without a doubt, we will govern well until then.

First citizen:
This was the state when Henry VI
Was crowned in Paris but at nine months.

Third citizen:
So did the State stand firm? No, no, my good friends, God knows;
For then this land was notoriously enriched
With serious political advice; then the king
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.

First citizen:
Well, the same goes for father and mother.

Third citizen:
Better that they all come to the father,
Or on the father's side, there was none at all;
For emulation now, which will be closest,
Will touch us too closely, if God does not prevent us.
Oh, the Duke of Gloucester is full of dangers!
And the sons and brothers of the queen haughty and proud:
And if they were to be governed, and not to govern,
This sickly land could comfort as before.

First citizen:
Come on, come on, we fear the worst; Everything will be alright.

Third citizen:
When the clouds appear, the wise put on their cloaks;
When the large leaves fall, winter is near;
When the sun sets, who does not seek out the night?
Untimely storms make men hope for a famine.
Everything can go well; but, if God arranges things like this,
It's more than we deserve, or so I imagine.

Second citizen:
Verily, the souls of men are full of fear:
You almost can't reason with a man
It doesn't look heavy and full of fear.

Third citizen:
Before the times of change, it is always like this:
By a divine instinct, the minds of men are wary
Dangers arising therefrom; as proof, we see
The waters swell before a violent storm.
But leave everything to God. where is it far?

Second citizen:
Get married, we have been summoned to the judges.

Third citizen:
And me too: I will keep you company.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Last night I heard they were lying at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will they be this evening:
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, they will be there.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I long with all my heart to see the prince:
I hope he's grown a lot since I last saw him.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But I hear, no; they say my son from York
It almost surpassed him in his growth.

YORK:
Yes mom ; but I wouldn't want to.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Well, my young cousin, growing up is good.

YORK:
Grandma, one evening, while we were sitting at supper,
My Uncle Rivers talked about how I grew up
More than my brother: “Yes”, said my uncle
Gloucester,
“Small weeds are graceful, big weeds grow quickly:”
And as I think I wouldn't grow up so quickly,
Because the sweet flowers are slow and the weeds rush.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
In him it opposed the same thing to you;
He was the most miserable thing when he was young,
So long growing and so quietly,
That if this rule were true, he should be kind.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Well, ma'am, that's definitely the case.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.

YORK:
Now, my goodness, if I had been remembered,
I could have flouted my uncle's grace,
Touching his waist closer than he touched mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What, my pretty York? Please let me hear it.

YORK:
Get married, they say my uncle grew up so fast
That he could gnaw a crust at two o'clock
It took me two years before I had a tooth.
Grandma, that would have been a biting joke.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Please, pretty York, who told you that?

YORK:
Grandmother, his nurse.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
His nurse! well, she was dead before you were born.

YORK:
If it wasn't her, I wouldn't know who told me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A talking boy: go ahead, you're too smart.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Good lady, don't be angry with the child.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Pitchers have ears.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Here is a messenger. What's new?

Messenger:
Such news, my lord, saddens me to announce it to you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How is the prince?

Messenger:
Well, ma'am, and in good health.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
So what's your news?

Messenger:
Lord Rivers and Lord Gray are sent to Pomfret,
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who committed them?

Messenger:
The mighty dukes
Gloucester and Buckingham.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For what offense?

Messenger:
I disclosed everything I could;
Why or what these nobles were hired for
All this is unknown to me, my gracious lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Yes, I see the fall of our house!
The tiger has now seized the gentle doe;
The insulting tyranny begins to fall
On the innocent and formidable throne:
Welcome, destruction, death and slaughter!
I see, like on a map, the end of everything.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Days of cursed and disturbing quarrels,
How many of you have seen my eyes!
My husband lost his life to obtain the crown;
And often my sons were shaken,
For me to rejoice and mourn their gains and losses:
And sit and grill at home
Own exaggeration, themselves, the conquerors.
Make war on themselves; blood against blood,
Self versus self: O, absurd
And frenzied indignation, put an end to your cursed spleen;
Or let me die, so as not to look at death again!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, my boy; we are going to take refuge.
Madam, farewell.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will accompany you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You have no cause.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
My gracious lady, go;
And bring there your treasure and your goods.
For my part, I will resign myself to your grace
The seal that I keep: and so on for me
Also I offer you and all yours!
Come, I'll take you to the sanctuary.

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your room.

GLOCKESTER:
Welcome, dear cousin, sovereign of my thoughts
Fatigue has made you melancholy.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
I made it tedious, tedious and heavy
I want more uncles here to welcome me.

GLOCKESTER:
Sweet prince, the intact virtue of your years
Has not yet plunged into the deception of the world
You can't tell a man apart either
That of its external appearance; who, God knows,
He rarely or never jumps with his heart.
These uncles you want were dangerous;
Your Grace listened to their sweet words,
But don't look at the poison in their hearts:
God save you from them and these false friends!

PRINCE EDWARD:
God save me from false friends! but there was none.

GLOCKESTER:
My lord, the Mayor of London has come to greet you.

Lord Mayor:
May God bless your grace with health and happy days!

PRINCE EDWARD:
I thank you, good monseigneur; and thank you all.
I thought my mother and my brother York,
It would have been a long time before it met us on the path
Fie, what a slug Hastings is, that he won't come
To tell us if they will come or not!

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in time, here comes the sweaty lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?

HASTING:
On what occasion, God knows, not I,
The queen your mother and your brother York,
Have taken refuge: the tender prince
I would have liked to come with me to meet Your Grace,
But his mother inevitably held him back.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fie, what an indirect and sullen journey
Is it hers! Lord Cardinal, your grace
Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York
To his princely brother currently?
If she denies it, Lord Hastings, go with him,
And from his jealous arms, we must tear him away.

CARDINAL:
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak speech
May from his mother win the Duke of York,
Expect him here soon; but if she is stubborn
To gentle supplications, God in heaven preserve us
We should violate the holy privilege
From the blessed sanctuary! not for all this earth
Could I be guilty of such a deep sin?

BUCKINGHAM:
You are too foolish, obstinate, my lord,
Too formal and traditional
Weigh it but with the rudeness of this age,
You don't break your sanctuary by grabbing it.
The benefit is always granted
To those whose relationships have earned the place,
And those who have the spirit to claim the place:
This prince neither demanded nor deserved it;
And so, in my opinion, I can't have it:
Then, taking it from there, what is not there,
You are not violating any privileges or charters there.
I have often heard of men of the sanctuary;
But the sanctuary children never arrived until now.

CARDINAL:
My lord, you will dominate my mind for once.
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you come with me?

HASTING:
I'm going, my lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Good lords, do all you can with all haste.
Say, Uncle Gloucester, if our brother comes,
Where will we stay until our coronation?

GLOCKESTER:
Wherever it looks best to your royal being.
If I can advise you, a day or two
Your Highness will rest at the Tower:
So wherever you want, and we will judge it to be the most appropriate
For your better health and leisure.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I don't like the Tower, or any place.
Did Julius Caesar build this place, my lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
He indeed, my gracious lord, began this place;
Which, since then, successive eras have rebuilt.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Is it recorded, or reported?
Successively from age to age, did he build it?

BUCKINGHAM:
It's official, my gracious lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
But say, my lord, that they were not recorded,
I think the truth should live from age to age,
As it was retailed to all posterity,
Even until the general day ends.

GLOCKESTER:

PRINCE EDWARD:
What do you say, uncle?

GLOCKESTER:
I say that without characters, fame lasts a long time.
Thus, like formal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two meanings in one word.

PRINCE EDWARD:
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
With which his value has enriched his mind,
His spirit began to bring his value to life
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
For now, he lives in glory, but not in life.
I will tell you, my cousin Buckingham,...

BUCKINGHAM:
What, my gracious lord?

PRINCE EDWARD:
And if I live until I am a man,
I will win our ancient right in France again,
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.

GLOCKESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, in time, here comes the Duke of York.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Richard of York! how is our beloved brother?

YORK:
Well, my fearsome lord; so I have to call you now.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Yes, brother, to our sorrow, as it is yours:
He died too late when he could have retained this title,
Who by his death lost much majesty.

GLOCKESTER:
How is our cousin, noble Lord of York?

YORK:
Thank you, sweet uncle. O my lord,
You said unused weeds grow quickly
The prince my brother has become much too big for me.

GLOCKESTER:
He did it, my lord.

YORK:
And so is he idle?

GLOCKESTER:
O my beautiful cousin, I must not say it.

YORK:
So he looks at you more than me.

GLOCKESTER:
He can command me as my sovereign;
But you have power in me like in a parent.

YORK:
Please, uncle, give me this dagger.

GLOCKESTER:
My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.

PRINCE EDWARD:
A beggar, my brother?

YORK:
From my kind uncle, who, I know, will give it to me;
And it's just a toy, which is no grief to give.

GLOCKESTER:
A greater gift than the one I will give to my cousin.

YORK:
A bigger gift! Oh, it's the sword.

GLOCKESTER:
A nice cousin, if that was light enough.

YORK:
Oh, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
In more important things, you will say a beggar no.

GLOCKESTER:
It is too heavy for your grace to bear.

YORK:
I weigh it slightly, if it were heavier.

GLOCKESTER:
What, would you like my weapon, little lord?

YORK:
I will, so I can thank you while you call me.

GLOCKESTER:
How?

YORK:
Little.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Monsignor of York will always be angry in his words:
Uncle, Your Grace knows how to handle it.

YORK:
You mean, put up with me, don't put up with me:
My uncle, my brother makes fun of you and me;
Because I am small, like a monkey,
He thinks you should carry me on your shoulders.

BUCKINGHAM:
With what finesse of mind he reasons!
To alleviate the contempt he has for his uncle,
He taunts himself nicely and rightly:
So cunning and so young, it's wonderful.

GLOCKESTER:
My lord, would you not like to let it pass?
Me and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother, to beg her
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.

YORK:
What, will you go to the Tower, my lord?

PRINCE EDWARD:
My lord protector will need it.

YORK:
I won't sleep peacefully at the Tower.

GLOCKESTER:
Why, what should we fear?

YORK:
Get married, angry ghost of my uncle Clarence:
My grandmother told me he was murdered there.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I'm afraid no uncle is dead.

GLOCKESTER:
Nor any of those who live, I hope.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And if they live, I hope I won't have to fear.
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
Thinking of them, I go to the Tower.

BUCKINGHAM:
Do you think, my lord, that talkative little York
Wasn't irritated by his subtle mother
Taunting and scorning you in this way?

GLOCKESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; Oh, he's a strange boy;
Bold, fast, resourceful, forward-thinking, capable
It belongs entirely to the mother, from head to toe.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, let them rest. Come here, Catesby.
You have sworn as deeply to carry out what we intend
We might as well hide what we transmit:
You know that our reasons are invoked along the way;
What do you think ? Isn't it an easy matter?
To make William Lord Hastings forget,
For the installation of this noble duke
At the royal seat of this famous island?

CATESBY:
He loves the prince so much, for his father's sake,
That nothing will be won against him.

BUCKINGHAM:
So what do you think of Stanley? what will he do?

CATESBY:
He will do everything like Hastings.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, nothing more than this: Come on, sweet Catesby,
And, as if you were far away, Lord Hastings,
How is it affected by our design?
And summon him tomorrow to the Tower,
Sit around the crowning.
If you find it treatable with us,
Encourage him and show him all our reasons:
If he is leaden, cold, reluctant,
Be it too; and so interrupt your speech,
And let us know his inclination:
For tomorrow we will hold divided councils,
To which you will be highly employed.

GLOCKESTER:
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
His former group of dangerous adversaries
Tomorrow, blood will be shed at the Château de Pomfret;
And tell my friend, for the joy of this good news,
Give Mistress Shore one more sweet kiss.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well Catesby, go and see this matter through.

CATESBY:
My good lords both, with all the attention I can.

GLOCKESTER:
Can we hear from you, Catesby, before we sleep?

CATESBY:
You will, my lord.

GLOCKESTER:
At Crosby Place you will find us both.

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
Lord Hastings will not give in to our plots?

GLOCKESTER:
Cut his head off, man; a little we will do:
And look, when I'm king, claim me
County Hereford and furniture
Of which the king my brother was possessed.

BUCKINGHAM:
I will claim this promise in the hands of Your Grace.

GLOCKESTER:
And see to it that it is given up with all your will.
Come on, let's have an early sup, so that afterwards
We can digest our conspiracies in one form or another.

Messenger:
What, ho! My lord!

HASTING:

Messenger:
A messenger from Lord Stanley.

HASTING:
It's not time?

Messenger:
Around four o'clock.

HASTING:
Can't your master sleep these tedious nights?

Messenger:
So it seems I have to say.
Firstly, he recommends it to your noble lordship.

HASTING:
And then?

Messenger:
And then he sends you a note
He dreamed last night that the boar had shaved his helm:
Furthermore, he says that there are two councils held;
And this can be determined at one
which can lead you and him to miss the other.
This is why he sends to know the good pleasure of your Lordship,
If you now take a horse with him,
And with all speed post him with him towards the north,
To flee the danger that his soul senses.

HASTING:
Go, my friend, go, return to your lord;
Tell him not to fear separate advice
His honor and I agree,
And at the other is my servant Catesby
Where nothing can happen that affects us
Of which I will have no intelligence.
Tell him that his fears are superficial, for example:
And for his dreams, I wonder if he loves so much
Trusting the taunts of restless sleep
Make the boar fly before the boar chases him,
We had to praise the boar so that he would follow us
And give chase where he didn't want to.
Go, tell your master to get up and come to me
And we will both go together to the Tower,
Where, he sees, the boar will use us kindly.

Messenger:
My gracious lord, I will tell him what you say.

CATESBY:
Good tomorrow to my noble lord!

HASTING:
Hello, Catesby; You are ahead
What news, what news, in this tottering state?

CATESBY:
The world is truly shaken, my lord;
And I don't think he'll ever stand
Tim Richard wears the garland of the kingdom.

HASTING:
How! wear the garland! you mean the crown?

CATESBY:
Yes, my good lord.

HASTING:
I will have my crown cut off from my shoulders
Before then, I will see the crown so ignoble lost.
But can you guess he's aiming for that?

CATESBY:
Yes, about my life; and hopes to find a future
On his side for the gain of this one:
And with that he sends you this good news,
That this same day your enemies,
The queen's parents must die at Pomfret.

HASTING:
Indeed, I am not in mourning for this news,
Because they are still my enemies:
But I will give my vote on Richard's side,
To prevent my master's heirs from true descendants,
God knows I won't, until I die.

CATESBY:
God keep your lordship in this gracious spirit!

HASTING:
But I'll laugh about it in twelve months,
May those who brought me into hatred of my master
I live to contemplate their tragedy.
I tell you, Catesby...

CATESBY:
What, my lord?

HASTING:
Before fifteen days, make me elder,
I'm going to send packaging but I don't think about it.

CATESBY:
It is a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
When men are not prepared and do not seek it.

HASTING:
Oh monstrous, monstrous! and this is how it falls
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and that will do the trick
With other men, who think they're safe
Like you and me; which, as you know, are expensive
To Princely Richard and Buckingham.

CATESBY:
The princes hold you both in high esteem;
Because we count his head on the bridge.

HASTING:
I know they do; and I deserved it.
Come on; where's your boar, dude?
Do you fear the wild boar and leave without provisions?

STANLEY:
Monsignor, hello; Hello, Catesby:
You can joke, but, by the holy rood screen,
I don't like this advice.

HASTING:
My lord,
I hold my life as dear as yours;
And never in my life do I protest,
Was it more valuable to me than now:
Do you think, but I know our state is secure,
Would I be as triumphant as I am?

STANLEY:
The lords of Pomfret, when they came from London,
Were joyful and assumed their condition was safe,
And indeed they had no reason to be suspicious;
But yet, you see how quickly the day fell.
This sudden stag of resentment that I doubt:
I pray to God, I said, I prove myself to be a useless coward!
What, are we heading towards the Tower? the day has passed.

HASTING:
Come, come, be with you. What are you doing, my lord?
Today, the lords you speak of are beheaded.

LORD STANLEY:
For their truth they better wear their heads
So some who accused them wear their hats off.
But come, my lord, let us go.

HASTING:
Continue forward; I'm going to speak with this good guy.
And now, sir! how is the world with you?

Continuing:
Better your lordship asks me.

HASTING:
I tell you, man, it's better with me now
That the last time I met you, where now we meet:
So I went prisoner to the Tower,
By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
But now I tell you, keep it to yourself.
Today these enemies are put to death,
And I'm in better shape than ever.

Continuing:
God save him, to the good pleasure of Your Honor!

HASTING:
Gramercy, my friend: here, drink this for me.

Continuing:
God save your lordship!

Priest:
Welcome, my lord; I am happy to see your honor.

HASTING:
I thank you, good Sir John, with all my heart.
I am indebted to you for your last exercise;
Come next Sabbath and I will satisfy you.

BUCKINGHAM:
What, speak with a priest, Lord Chamberlain?
Your friends from Pomfret need the priest;
Your Honor has no pending tasks.

HASTING:
Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
These men you speak of came to mind.
What, are you going towards the Tower?

BUCKINGHAM:
Yes my Lord ; but I won't stay long
From there, I will return to your Lordship.

HASTING:
That's enough, because I'm staying here for dinner.

BUCKINGHAM:

HASTING:
I will wait for your lordship.

RATCLIFF:
Come, get the prisoners out.

RIVERS:
Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me say this to you:
Today you will see a subject die
For truth, for duty and for loyalty.

GRAY:
God save the prince of your entire pack!
You are a knot of bloody leeches!

VAUGHAN:
You live and will cry unhappiness because of this afterwards.

RATCLIFF:
Shipping; the limit of your life has been exceeded.

RIVERS:
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O you, bloody prison,
Fatal and worrying for the noble peers!
In the guilty closure of your walls
Richard II, here, was killed with an axe;
And, to further slander your sad seat,
We give you our innocent blood to drink.

GRAY:
Now Margaret's curse falls on our heads,
For standing by when Richard stabbed her son.

RIVERS:
Then she cursed Hastings, then she cursed Buckingham,
Then she cursed Richard. O, remember, my God
To hear his prayers for them, as now for us
And for my sister and her princely sons,
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
Which, as you know, must be unjustly poured out.

RATCLIFF:
Hurry up ; the hour of death has expired.

RIVERS:
Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let's all kiss:
And let's take our leave, until we meet again in paradise.

HASTING:
My lords, immediately: the reason why we are met
This is to determine the coronation.
In the name of God, speak: when is the royal day?

BUCKINGHAM:
Is everything suitable for this royal period?

DERBY:
This is the case and all it takes is one nomination.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Tomorrow therefore, I judge a happy day.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows the spirit of the lord protector here?
Who is more inward with the royal duke?

BISHOP OF ELY:
We believe that Your Grace should know his mind as soon as possible.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who, I, my lord, know each other's faces,
But for our hearts, he no longer knows about mine,
Than me of yours;
I am no more of his than you are of mine.
Lord Hastings, you and he are very much in love.

HASTING:
I thank his grace, I know that he loves me;
But, for his purpose during the coronation.
I did not probe him, and he did not deliver to me
His gracious pleasure in any case:
But you, my noble lords, can set the time;
And in the name of the Duke I will give my voice,
Which he will take, I presume, gently.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Now, in time, here comes the Duke himself.

GLOCKESTER:
My noble Lords and cousins, good morning.
I slept a long time; but I hope,
My absence neglects no great design,
Which, by my presence, could have been concluded.

BUCKINGHAM:
If you had not answered your request, my lord
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,
I mean, your vote, for the coronation of the king.

GLOCKESTER:
No one is more daring than my Lord Hastings;
His Lordship knows me well and likes me well.

HASTING:
I thank your grace.

GLOCKESTER:
Monsignor of Ely!

BISHOP OF ELY:
My lord?

GLOCKESTER:
The last time I was in Holborn,
I saw some good strawberries there in your garden
Please send for some.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Get married and I will do it, my lord, with all my heart.

GLOCKESTER:
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
Catesby probed Hastings in our affairs,
And finds the irritable gentleman so hot,
As he will lose his mind before giving his consent
His master's son, as venerable as he calls him,
Will lose the royalty of the throne of England.

BUCKINGHAM:
Leave here, my lord, I will follow you.

DERBY:
We have not yet fixed this day of triumph.
Tomorrow, in my opinion, is too sudden;
Because I myself am not so well endowed
As I would otherwise be if the day continued.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my lord protector? I sent for this
strawberries.

HASTING:
Her grace seems cheerful and sweet today;
There is one vain person or another who likes him,
When he wishes good morning with such spirit.
I think there is never a man in Christianity
This can hide his love or his hatred less than he;
For by his upright face you will know his heart.

DERBY:
What does his heart perceive you in his face
In all likelihood he would have come today?

HASTING:
Marry, that without a man here he may be offended;
Because if he was, he showed it in his appearance.

DERBY:
I pray to God he isn't, I said.

GLOCKESTER:
Please tell me what they all deserve
Who plot my death with evil plots
Of cursed witchcraft, and which prevailed
On my body with their infernal charms?

HASTING:
The tender love that I bear your grace, my lord,
Makes me most prominent in this noble presence
To condemn the offenders, whoever they may be
I say, my lord, that they deserved death.

GLOCKESTER:
So be your eyes witness to this evil:
See how bewitched I am; here is my arm
Is, like a cursed sapling, withered:
And here is Edward's wife, this monstrous witch,
In association with that trumpet prostitute Shore,
Who by their witchcraft have thus marked me.

HASTING:
If they did this, my gracious lord...

GLOCKESTER:
If I'm the protector of this damn trumpet...
Are you talking to me about “if”? You are a traitor:
Cut off his head! Now, by Saint Paul, I swear,
I won't eat dinner until I see the same thing.
Lovel and Ratcliff, watch it be done:
The others, who love me, get up and follow me.

HASTING:
Woe, woe to England! not at all for me;
Because I, too affectionate, could have prevented this.
Stanley did dream that the boar shaved his helmet;
But I disdained it and I disdained to steal:
Three times today my cloth-footed horse has stumbled,
And surprised, when he looked at the Tower,
You might as well be reluctant to take me to the slaughterhouse.
Oh, now I want the priest who told me:
I repent now, I told the pursuer
As they triumphed over my enemies,
How they were bloodily massacred at Pomfret,
And I myself am assured of grace and favor.
O Margaret, Margaret, now your heavy curse
Is lit on poor Hastings' miserable head!

RATCLIFF:
Hurry up, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
Make a small gesture; he wants to see your face.

HASTING:
O momentary grace of mortal men,
That we seek more than the grace of God!
Who builds his hopes on the air of your beauty,
He lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
Ready, at every nod, to fall
In the fatal bowels of the depths.

LOVE :
Come, come, hurry; it is useless to exclaim.

HASTING:
Oh damn Richard! miserable England!
I prophesy to you the scariest moment
This always miserable age looked.
Come, take me to the operating room; take my head to him.
They smile at me that I will soon be dead.

GLOCKESTER:
Come, cousin, can you tremble and change color,
Kill your breath in the middle of a word,
And then start again, and stop again,
As if you were helpless and mad with terror?

BUCKINGHAM:
But I can counterfeit the profound tragedian;
Speak and look back, and search on all sides,
Tremble and start stirring a straw,
Intent of deep suspicion: terrible looks
Are at my service, like forced smiles;
And both are ready in their offices,
At any time, to honor my stratagems.
But what, Catesby is gone?

GLOCKESTER:
He is; and, you see, he brings the mayor with him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord Mayor,--

GLOCKESTER:
Look at the drawbridge over there!

BUCKINGHAM:
Listen ! a drum.

GLOCKESTER:
Catesby, look at the walls.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord Mayor, the reason we sent...

GLOCKESTER:
Look back, defend yourself, here are the enemies.

BUCKINGHAM:
God and our innocence defend us and keep us!

GLOCKESTER:
Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.

LOVE :
Here is the head of this vile traitor,
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

GLOCKESTER:
I loved this man so much that I have to cry.
I took him for the most harmless creature
Who breathed on this earth a Christian;
I made him my book in which my soul recorded
The story of all his secret thoughts:
So gentle that he coated his vice with a display of virtue,
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
He lived off all the suspects.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, well, he was the shelter's most secret traitor
Who ever lived.
Would you imagine, or almost would you believe,
Isn't it, by great preservation,
We live to tell you, the subtle traitor
This day had been plotted, in the council house
To murder me and my good lord of Gloucester?

Lord Mayor:
What, had he done it?

GLOCKESTER:
What, do you think we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we would, against the form of the law,
Proceed thus recklessly until the villain dies,
But this is the extreme danger of the matter,
The peace of England and the safety of our persons,
Did he force us to this execution?

Lord Mayor:
Now it's happening to you! he deserved his death;
And you, my good lords, have both done well,
To warn false traitors of such attempts.
I have never looked for better in his hands,
After he once fell out with Mistress Shore.

GLOCKESTER:
And yet, if we hadn't decided that he would die,
Until your lordship comes to see his death;
It is now the amorous haste of our friends,
A little against our senses, we prevented:
Because, my lord, we would have liked to make you hear
The traitor speaks and shyly confesses
The manner and purpose of his betrayal;
That you could have meant the same thing
To citizens, who could perhaps
Misunderstand him and mourn his death.

Lord Mayor:
But, my good lord, the word of your Grace will be useful,
As good as I had seen and heard about
And do not doubt it, both noble princes,
But I will inform our loyal citizens
With all your just efforts for this cause.

GLOCKESTER:
And to this end we wish your lordship to be here,
To avoid harsh criticism from the world.

BUCKINGHAM:
But as you arrive too late compared to our intentions,
Yet witness what you hear, we intended:
And so, my dear mayor, we say goodbye.

GLOCKESTER:
Come on, then, later, cousin Buckingham.
The Mayor of Guildhall holds it in all positions:
There, at your advantage of time,
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
Tell them how Edward put a citizen to death,
Only for saying he would make his son
Heir to the crown; that is indeed his house,
Which, by its sign, was called thus.
Moreover, exhort his hateful luxury
And bestial appetite as a replacement for lust;
Which extended to their servants, daughters, wives,
Even where his lustful eye or his wild heart,
Without control, he prepares to make it his prey.
Even more, if necessary, approach my person:
Tell them when my mother left with a child
Of this insatiable Edward, noble York
My princely father then had wars in France
And, by a simple calculation of time,
I discovered that the problem was not his creation;
Which stood out well in his features,
Having nothing to do with the noble Duke my father:
But touch it sparingly, for it was far away,
Because you know, my lord, my mother is alive.

BUCKINGHAM:
Have no fear, my lord, I will play the orator
As if the gold fees I plead for
Were for me: and so, my lord, farewell.

GLOCKESTER:
If you flourish well, take them to Baynard's Castle;
Where you will find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and educated bishops.

BUCKINGHAM:
I'm going: and around three or four o'clock
Look for news from the Guildhall.

GLOCKESTER:
Go, Lovel, as quickly as possible to Doctor Shaw;
Go to Brother Penker; give them both
Meet me this hour at Baynard Castle.
Now I'm going to come in, to take a private order,
To lure Clarence's children out of sight;
And to point out that in no way can anyone
At all times resort to the princes.

Scribe:
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
Which, in an outstretched hand, is quite absorbed,
Let it be today, read in Paul's.
And note how well the following holds together:
I spent eleven hours writing it,
Because last night it was Catesby who brought me;
The previous one was full as long as it was:
And yet, during those five hours lived Lord Hastings,
Unaltered, unexamined, free, at large
In the meantime, it's good people! Why is that so disgusting,
Who does not see this palpable device?
Yet who is so blind, but says he does not see it?
The world is bad; and everything will come to nothing,
When such bad relationships must be seen in thought.

GLOCKESTER:
And now, my lord, what do the citizens say?

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
The citizens are silent and do not say a word.

GLOCKESTER:
Have you touched on the bastardy of Edward's children?

BUCKINGHAM:
I did it; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his contract as a deputy in France;
The insatiable greed of his desires,
And his execution of the city's wives;
His tyranny over trifles; his own bastardy,
As having arrived, your father then in France,
His resemblance not being that of the Duke;
I deduced your lineaments,
Being your father's good idea,
Both in your form and in your nobility of spirit;
Opened all your victories in Scotland,
Your discipline in war, your wisdom in peace,
Your generosity, your virtue, your just humility:
Indeed, he left nothing suitable for this purpose
Untouched, or slightly manipulated, in speech
And when my oratory ended
I told them that they loved the good of their country
Shout “God save Richard, the royal king of England!” »

GLOCKESTER:
Ah! and did they do it?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, then God help me, they didn't say a word;
But, like mute statues or breathing stones,
They looked at each other and looked deathly pale.
When I saw them, I reprimanded them;
And he asked the mayor what this voluntary silence meant:
His response was: people weren't used to it
To be spoken but by the recorder.
Then he was invited to tell my story again,
“Thus said the Duke, thus he deduced; »
But there was nothing to justify it on his part.
When he had finished, some of my disciples said:
At the back of the room, they threw their caps in the air,
And a dozen voices cried: “May God save King Richard!”
And so I took advantage of these few,
“Thank you, dear citizens and friends,” I said;
"These general applause and these cries of love
Showcase your wisdom and your love towards Richard: '
And even here he stopped and started again.

GLOCKESTER:
What languageless blocks they were! would they not have spoken?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my faith, my lord.

GLOCKESTER:
Won't the mayor and his brothers come?

BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor is there: have fear;
It is not with you that you have spoken, but with a powerful trial:
And look, you have a prayer book in your hand,
And stand between two men of the Church, my good lord;
For on this basis I will construct a holy verse:
And don't be easily convinced by our request:
Play the role of the servant, say no anyway and accept it.

GLOCKESTER:
I go; and if you also plead for them
As I can say no to you for myself,
There is no doubt that we will bring about a happy outcome.

BUCKINGHAM:
Go, go, to the slopes; the mayor knocks.
Welcome my lord; I dance here attendance;
I don't think we'll talk about the Duke.
Here is his servant: Well, Catesby,
What's he saying ?

CATESBY:
Monsignor: he implores your grace;
To visit him tomorrow or the day after tomorrow:
He is inside, with two very reverend fathers,
Divinely immersed in meditation;
And no trial in the world would move it,
To get him out of his holy exercise.

BUCKINGHAM:
Return, good Catesby, to your lord;
Tell him, myself, the mayor and the citizens,
In deep purposes and matters of great importance,
No less important than our general good,
Came to have a conference with his grace.

CATESBY:
I will tell him what you say, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is no Edward!
He doesn't lounge on a lewd daybed,
But on my knees in meditation;
Without hanging out with a few courtesans,
But meditate with two profound deities;
Not to sleep, to absorb his idle body,
But by praying, to enrich his vigilant soul:
Happy was England, this gracious prince
Assume sovereignty:
But of course, I fear, we will never be able to convince him to do so.

Lord Mayor:
Get married, God forbid that his grace should say no to us!

BUCKINGHAM:
I'm afraid he will.
And now, Catesby, what does your lord say?

CATESBY:
My lord,
He wonders for what purpose you assembled
Such troops of citizens to speak to him,
His grace not being previously informed:
Monsignor, he fears that you want nothing from him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Sorry, I'm my noble cousin, I should
Suspect me that I don't wish him anything good:
By heaven, I come for him in perfect love;
And so come back again and say grace to him.
When holy and pious religious
Are in their pearls, it is difficult to get them from there,
Zealous contemplation is so sweet.

Lord Mayor:
See where he stands between two clergymen!

BUCKINGHAM:
Two accessories of virtue for a Christian prince,
To protect him from the fall of vanity:
And see, with a prayer book in hand,
True ornaments for knowing a holy man.
Famous Plantagenet, very gracious prince,
Lend favorable ears to our request;
And forgive us for the interruption
Of your dedication and your just Christian zeal.

GLOCKESTER:
My lord, such excuses are not necessary:
Rather, I beg you to forgive me,
Who, sincere in the service of my God,
Neglecting the visit of my friends.
But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
Even this, I hope, which pleases God on high,
And all the good men of this ungoverned island.

GLOCKESTER:
I suspect that I have committed an offense
It seems shameful in the eyes of the city,
And that you come to reprimand my ignorance.

BUCKINGHAM:
You have done it, my lord: would it please your Grace,
To our supplications, to repair this fault!

GLOCKESTER:
Otherwise, why am I breathing in a Christian country?

BUCKINGHAM:
So know it's your fault if you quit
The supreme seat, the majestic throne,
The sceptered office of your ancestors,
Your state of wealth and your origin,
The linear glory of your royal house,
To the corruption of a stained vine:
While, in the sweetness of your sleeping thoughts,
And here we wake up for the good of our country,
This noble island lacks its own members;
His face disfigured by the scars of infamy,
His royal graft with vile plants,
And almost shouldered into the sunken abyss
Of blind oblivion and dark oblivion.
What to recover, we warmly request
Your gracious self to take charge
And the royal government of your country,
Not as protector, steward, substitute,
Or a weak factor for the gain of others;
But like successively from blood to blood,
Your birthright, your empire, yours.
To do this, in collaboration with citizens,
Your most devoted and loving friends,
And at their vehement instigation,
In this fair suit, I come to move your grace.

GLOCKESTER:
I don't know if I should leave in silence,
Or speak bitterly in your reproach.
Best matches my degree or your condition
If you don't respond, you might think
Mute ambition, not responding, gave way
To carry the golden yoke of sovereignty,
That you would impose me here with tenderness;
If I want to reprimand you for your trial,
So seasoned with your faithful love for me.
Then, on the other side, I checked on my friends.
Therefore, to speak and avoid the former,
And then, while speaking, so as not to incur the last,
Definitely this is how I answer you.
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Undeserved avoids your high demand.
First, if all obstacles were removed,
And that my path was to the crown,
Like my income ripe and due by birth
Yet my poverty of spirit is such,
So powerful and so many of my faults,
As I would have preferred to hide from my greatness,
Being a boat to endure no mighty sea,
That in my greatness I desire to hide,
And in the vapor of my stifled glory.
But, thank God, I don't need me,
And I really need to help you, if necessary;
The royal tree left us royal fruits,
Who, softened by stolen hours,
Will indeed become the seat of majesty,
And undoubtedly makes us happy with his reign.
On him I ask what you would ask me,
The right and fortune of its happy stars;
May God forbid that I snatch it from him!

BUCKINGHAM:
Monsignor, this discusses conscience in your grace;
But their respects are kind and insignificant,
All circumstances considered.
You say Edward is your brother's son:
That's what we say, too, but not through Edward's wife;
For the first time, he was under contract with Lady Lucy...
Your mother is witness to this wish...
And then, by substitution, engaged
To Bona, sister of the King of France.
These two things were asked by a poor petitioner,
A crazy caring mother and many children,
A widow in decline and distress,
Even on the afternoon of his best days,
Makes price and purchase of his lustful eye,
Seduces the height and height of all his thoughts
To base the declination and hate bigamy
It was near her, in her illegal bed, that he received
This Edward, whom our manners call the prince.
Could I denounce with more bitterness,
Except that, out of respect for certain living people,
I give a limit of savings to my tongue.
So, good my lord, regain your royal self
This offered a benefit of dignity;
If we are not to bless ourselves and the earth,
Yet, to assert your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusive times,
Towards a truly derived linear course.

Lord Mayor:
Do it, my lord, your citizens beg you.

BUCKINGHAM:
Do not refuse, mighty lord, this offered love.

CATESBY:
O, make them joyful, grant them their lawful trial!

GLOCKESTER:
Alas, why would you impose these worries on me?
I am unfit for the State and for majesty;
I beg you, don't take it the wrong way;
I cannot and will not give in to you.

BUCKINGHAM:
If you refuse it, as, out of love and zeal,
I am reluctant to put down the child, your brother's son;
We also know your tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind and effeminate remorse,
What we noted in you among your loved ones,
And also in all areas,
However, whether you accept our request or not,
Your brother's son will never reign over our king;
But we will plant another on the throne,
To the disgrace and ruin of your house:
And in this resolution we leave you here.--
Come, citizens: zounds! I won't beg anymore.

GLOCKESTER:
do not swear, my Lord of Buckingham.

CATESBY:
Call them again, my lord, and accept their request.

ANOTHER:
Do it, my good lord, lest the whole country regret it.

GLOCKESTER:
Would you impose a world of care on me?
Well, call them back. I'm not made of stone,
But penetrable for you. good supplications,
But against my conscience and my soul.
Cousin of Buckingham, and you, wise, grave men,
Since you will put fortune on my back,
To carry his burden, whether I like it or not,
I must have patience to bear the load:
But if a black scandal or a crude reproach
Attend the rest of your imposition,
Your simple execution will acquit me
Of all the impure stains and stains thereof;
For God knows it, and you can see it in part,
How far I am from desire.

Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace! we see it and we will say it.

GLOCKESTER:
By saying this, you will only be telling the truth.

BUCKINGHAM:
So I salute you with this royal title:
Long live Richard, the Royal King of England!

Lord Mayor:
Amen.

BUCKINGHAM:
Tomorrow, would you like to be crowned?

GLOCKESTER:
Even when you like, since you want to.

BUCKINGHAM:
Tomorrow then, we will witness Your Grace:
It is therefore with great joy that we take our leave.

GLOCKESTER:
Come, let us resume our holy task.
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, dear friends.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who meets us here? my niece Plantagenêt
Driven into the hands of her kind aunt from Gloucester?
Now for my life she wanders to the Tower,
On the love of the pure heart to greet the tender princes.
My daughter, well met.

LADY ANNE:
God bless you both
A happy and joyful time of the day!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Too bad for you, good sister! Where is it?

LADY ANNE:
No further than the Tower; and, as I suppose,
With the same dedication as you,
To congratulate the sweet princes there.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Good sister, thank you: we will all enter together.
And now the lieutenant arrives in time.
Master lieutenant, please, with your permission,
How are the prince and my young son of York?

FREINBURY:
Very well, dear madam. By your patience,
I cannot tolerate you visiting them;
The king clearly stated the opposite.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king! why, who is it?

FREINBURY:
I cry out to you for mercy: I mean the lord protector.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
May the Lord protect him from this royal title!
Did he put boundaries between their love and me?
I am their mother; who should keep me away from them?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am their father's mother; I will see them.

LADY ANNE:
Their aunt I am a mother-in-law, in love with their mother:
Then bring me to their sight; I will take your blame
And withdraw from your duties, at my own risk.

FREINBURY:
No, madam, no; I can't leave it like this:
I am bound by oath and therefore I forgive myself.

LORD STANLEY:
Let me meet you ladies in an hour,
And I will salute thy grace of York as a mother,
And reverend spectator of two beautiful queens.
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, cut my lace in two, so that my pent-up heart
I might have some room to fight, otherwise I'll pass out
With this deadly news!

LADY ANNE:
Despite news! Oh unpleasant news!

DORSET:
Take courage: mother, how is your grace?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, don't talk to me, leave here!
Death and destruction pursue you;
Your mother's name is a bad omen for children.
If you want to get ahead of death, set sail across the seas,
And live with Richmond, far from hell
Go, go, go away from this slaughterhouse,
Lest you increase the number of dead;
And make me die under the influence of Margaret's curse,
Neither mother, nor wife, nor Queen of England.

LORD STANLEY:
This is your advice, madam, full of wisdom.
Enjoy the hours quickly;
You will have letters from me to my son
To meet you along the way, and welcome you.
Don't be caught late by careless delay.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O wind of ill-dispersed misery!
O my cursed womb, bed of death!
You hatched into the world a cockatrice,
Whose unavoidable eye is murderous.

LORD STANLEY:
Come, madam, come; I was sent in a hurry.

LADY ANNE:
And I, reluctantly, will go.
I wish to God that inclusion was at the limit
Of golden metal which must round my forehead
Were red-hot steel, to burn me to the brain!
Anointed, let me be with deadly venom,
And die before men can say: God save the queen!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Go, go, poor soul, I do not envy your glory
To feed my humor, don't wish you harm.

LADY ANNE:
No! Why ? When he is my husband now
I came to me, as I followed Henry's corpse,
When blood was scarce, it was well washed from his hands
Who came from my other angel husband
And this dead saint whom I then followed, weeping;
Oh, when, I say, I looked into Richard's face,
This was my wish: “Be, I said, cursed,
For making me, so young, so old, a widow!
And when you marry, let sorrow haunt your bed;
And be your wife, if someone is so crazy,
So miserable with your life
As you did to me by the death of my dear lord!
Behold, before I can repeat this curse,
Even in such a short space, my woman's heart
Grossly become captive of his honeyed words
And I have proved the subject of the curse of my own soul,
Which has since prevented my eyes from resting;
For never an hour in his bed
Have I enjoyed the golden dew of sleep,
But he was awakened by his fearful dreams.
Besides, he hates me because of my father Warwick;
And will no doubt soon be rid of me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor heart, farewell! I pity your complaints.

LADY ANNE:
No more than with my soul I cry yours.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Farewell, unhappy host of glory!

LADY ANNE:
Farewell, poor soul, who takes leave of her!

DUCHESS OF YORK:

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Stay, but look with me towards the Tower.
Too bad, you old stones, these tender babies
That envy has locked up within your walls!
A crude cradle for such little pretties!
Ragged rude nurse, sullen old playmate
For the tender princes, use my babies well!
Thus, a senseless sadness bids farewell to your stones.

KING RICHARD III:
Stay away, cousin of Buckingham!

BUCKINGHAM:
My gracious sovereign?

KING RICHARD III:
Give me your hand.
So high, by your advice
And to thy aid sits King Richard;
But will we wear these honors for a day?
Or will they last, and we are happy about it?

BUCKINGHAM:
May they still live and may they last forever!

KING RICHARD III:
O Buckingham, now I play the touch,
To try if you are indeed current gold
Young Edward lives: now think what I would say.

BUCKINGHAM:
Continue, my dear lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, you are, my thrice-renowned lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Ha! am I king? it is true: but Edward lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
It is true, noble prince.

KING RICHARD III:
O bitter consequence,
This Edward should still live! “It is true, noble prince!”
Cousin, you weren't so boring:
Should I be clear? I wish these bastards dead;
And I would like to have it executed suddenly.
What are you saying ? speak abruptly; be brief.

BUCKINGHAM:
Your grace can be your pleasure.

KING RICHARD III:
You are frozen, your goodness freezes:
Say, do I have your consent for them to die?

BUCKINGHAM:
Give me a little breath, a little break, my lord
Before saying positively:
I will resolve your grace immediately.

CATESBY:

KING RICHARD III:
I will converse with iron-minded fools
And disrespectful boys: none are for me
Who looks at me with caring eyes:
Buckingham, of great stature, becomes circumspect.
Boy!

Page:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Don't you know anyone who corrupts gold
Would he attempt a near-death feat?

Page:
My lord, I know a disgruntled gentleman,
Whose humble means do not correspond to his haughty spirit:
Gold was worth twenty speakers,
And that will undoubtedly tempt him into anything.

KING RICHARD III:
What's her name?

Page:
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.

KING RICHARD III:
I know part of this man: go call him here.
The witty and deeply turning Buckingham
No one will be next in my council anymore:
Did he resist me for so long without getting tired,
And does he stop now to catch his breath?
How now! what news from you?

STANLEY:
My lord, I have heard that the Marquis Dorset has fled
In Richmond, in these regions beyond the sea
Where he lives.

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

CATESBY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
The rumor abroad
That Anne, my wife, is sick and would like to die:
I will take orders that she stays close.
Ask me for a born naughty gentleman,
Whom I will marry directly to Clarence's daughter:
This boy is stupid and I don't fear him.
Look how you dream! I repeat, give
That Anne my wife is sick and would like to die:
On this subject; because it is close to my heart,
To stop all the hopes whose growth could harm me.
I must be married to my brother's daughter,
Or my kingdom rests on fragile glass.
Murder her brothers, then marry her!
Uncertain method of winning! But I am in
Until now, it is in the blood that sin will uproot sin:
The pity that flows in tears dwells not in this eye.
Is your name Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.

KING RICHARD III:
Are you really?

TYRREL:
Prove to me, my gracious sovereign.

KING RICHARD III:
Would you dare to decide to kill one of my friends?

TYRREL:
Yes my Lord ;
But I prefer to kill two enemies.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, there you have it: two deep enemies,
Enemies of my rest and disturbers of my sweet sleep
Are these that I would like you to take care of:
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

TYRREL:
Let me have open ways to come to them,
And soon I will rid you of their fear.

KING RICHARD III:
You sing sweet music. Listen, come here, Tyrrel
Go, by this sign: arise and give ear:
There is nothing left but this: say that it is done,
And I will love you and prefer you too.

TYRREL:
It is done, my gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Shall we hear from you, Tyrrel, before we sleep?

TYRREL:
Yes my Lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have been thinking in my mind
The late request you asked me for.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let's let that pass. Dorset fled to Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
I have heard this news, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, he's your wife's son, take a good look at him.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
For which your honor and your faith are pledged;
County Hereford and furniture
The one you promised me you'd have.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, look at your wife; if it transmits
Letters to Richmond, you will answer them.

BUCKINGHAM:
What does Your Highness say to my just request?

KING RICHARD III:
If I remember correctly, Henry VI
Prophesied that Richmond would be king,
When Richmond was a moody little boy.
A king, maybe, maybe...

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
How fortunate was it that the prophet could not, at that moment,
Did you tell me, standing there, that I should kill him?

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, your promise for the county,...

KING RICHARD III:
Richmond! The last time I was in Exeter,
The mayor, out of courtesy, showed me the castle,
And I called it Rougemont: what name did I start with,
Because a bard from Ireland once told me
I wouldn't live long after seeing Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Yes, what time is it?

BUCKINGHAM:
So I am bold to think of your grace
Of what you promised me.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, but what time is it?

BUCKINGHAM:
Around ten o'clock.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let him hit.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let him hit?

KING RICHARD III:
Because, like Jack, you keep going
Between your begging and my meditation.
I'm not one to give today.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then solve me, whether you like it or not.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut tut,
You trouble me ; I'm not in the vein.

BUCKINGHAM:
Is this still the case? it rewards my true service
With such contempt, did I make him king for this?
O, let me think of Hastings and go
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is turned!

TYRREL:
The tyrannical and bloody act is accomplished.
The most pitiful massacre
What this land was always guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I bribed
To carry out this merciless butchery,
Even if they were flesh and blood villains, bloody dogs,
Fondant of tenderness and kind compassion
Wept like two children in the sad stories of their deaths.
“Here,” said Dighton, “lay these tender babies:”
“So, so,” said Forrest, “surrounding each other
In their innocent alabaster arms:
Their lips were four red roses on a stem,
Who, in their summer beauty, kissed each other.
A prayer book lay on their pillow;
Which once, said Forrest, almost changed my mind;
But oh! the devil - there the wicked stopped
While Dighton recounted: "We suffocated
Nature's sweetest most regenerated work,
This comes from the first creation that she framed.
So both go away with conscience and remorse;
They could not speak; and so I left them both,
To bring this news to the damn king.
And here it is.
Hello everyone, my sovereign liege!

KING RICHARD III:
Gentle Tyrrel, am I glad to hear your news?

TYRREL:
If I had done what you had entrusted to me
Generate your happiness, be happy then,
Because it is done, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
But have you seen them dead?

TYRREL:
I did it, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
And buried, kind Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
The Chaplain of the Tower buried them;
But how and where I don't know.

KING RICHARD III:
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon after dinner,
And you will tell the process of their death.
In the meantime, but think about what good I could do for you,
And be the heir of your desire.
Goodbye see you soon.
I locked Clarence's son up close;
I married his daughter miserably;
Edward's sons sleep in Abraham's bosom,
And Anne, my wife, wished the world a good night.
Now, because I know the Breton objectives of Richmond
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
And, through this knot, he proudly looks at the crown,
I go to her, a cheerful and prosperous courtesan.

CATESBY:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Good news or bad news, that you come so suddenly?

CATESBY:
Bad news, my lord: Ely has fled to Richmond;
And Buckingham, supported by the sturdy Welsh,
He is on the ground, and his power continues to increase.

KING RICHARD III:
Ely with Richmond bothers me closer
Than Buckingham and his reckless army.
Come on, I heard that scary comment
Is a leaden servant of boring delay;
Delay leads to helpless, snail-paced begging
Then the fiery expedition will be my wing,
Mercury of Jupiter and herald of a king!
Come, gather men: my counsel is my shield;
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
So now the prosperity begins to soften
And falls into the rotten mouth of death.
Here, within these limits, I hid,
To observe the decline of my adversaries.
I witness a terrible induction,
And I will return to France, hoping for the consequence
Will also turn out to be bitter, dark and tragic.
Withdraw, miserable Marguerite: who comes here?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babies!
My unblown flowers, my new sweets!
If, however, your sweet souls fly in the air
And don't be stuck in perpetual destiny,
Circle around me with your aerial wings
And listen to your mother's lamentations!

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Hover around it; say, it's good for good
Turned your child's morning into an old night.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
So much misery has made my voice crazy,
That my tired tongue is mute and mute,
Edouard Plantagenêt, why did you die?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Plantagenêt leaves Plantagenêt.
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Will you, O God, flee from these gentle lambs,
And throw them into the bowels of the wolf?
When did you sleep when such an act was committed?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
When Saint Harry died, and my sweet son.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Scene of misfortune, shame of the world, grave due to a usurped life,
Brief summary and account of the tedious days,
Rest your troubles on the legal land of England,
Illegally drunk with the blood of innocents!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, you might as well give yourself a grave
How you can give up a melancholy seat!
Then I would hide my bones, I would not lay them here.
O, who has a reason to cry but me?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
If the old pain is the most reverent,
Give mine the benefit of seniority,
And let my misfortunes take over.
If sorrow can admit society,
Recount your misfortunes again while looking at mine:
I had an Edward, until a Richard killed him;
I had a Harry, until a Richard killed him:
You had an Edward, until a Richard killed him;
You had a Richard, until a Richard killed him;

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I also had a Richard, and you killed him;
I also had a Rutland, you should kill him.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
You also had a Clarence, and Richard killed him.
From the kennel of your belly has slipped
A hellhound that chases us all to the death:
This dog who had his teeth in front of his eyes,
To worry the lambs and lap up their sweet blood,
This filthy destroyer of the work of God,
This excellent great tyrant of the earth,
Who reigns in the irritated eyes of crying souls,
Your stomach was unleashed to chase us to our graves.
O upright, just and sincere God,
How can I thank you, that this carnal dog
Feeds on the question of his mother's body,
And makes her bench companion with the moans of others!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O wife of Harry, do not triumph over my misfortunes!
God be my witness, I cried for yours.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Bear with me; I thirst for revenge,
And now I miss seeing him.
Your Edward is dead, the one who stabbed my Edward:
Your other Edward died, to leave my Edward;
Young York, he's just a boot, 'cause they're both
Do not correspond to the high perfection of my loss:
Your Clarence is dead, the one who killed my Edward;
And the spectators of this tragic play,
Adulterers Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
Untimely suffocated in their dark graves.
Richard still lives, the black intelligence of hell,
I only booked their postman, to buy souls
And send them there: but within reach, within reach,
His pitiful and merciless end follows:
The earth gapes, hell burns, demons roar, saints pray.
To have him taken away suddenly.
Cancel his life bond, my God, I'm taking it,
So that I can live and say: The dog is dead!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, you prophesied that the time would come
That I should wish you would help me curse
This spider in a bottle, this filthy toad with a crooked back!

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
I called you then in vain, blossoming of my fortune;
I called you then poor shadow, painted queen;
The presentation of what I was;
The flattering hint of a terrible spectacle;
One of them rose high to be thrown down;
A mother only made fun of two adorable babies;
A dream of what you were, a breath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
To be the target of every dangerous shot,
A queen in joke, only to fill the stage.
Where is your husband now? where are your brothers?
Where are your children? why do you do it, joy?
Who is suing you and shouting “God save the queen”?
Where are the bent peers who flattered you?
Where are the assembled troops who followed you?
Refuse all this and see what you are now:
For a happy wife, a very sorrowful widow;
For a joyful mother, one who cries the name;
For queen, a carefully crowned very-caitiff;
For the one who is pursued, the one who pursues humbly;
For someone who despised me, now despised me;
For one being feared by all, now he fears one;
For one commands all things, and obeys no one.
Thus has the course of justice turned,
And left you prey to time;
Having nothing left to think about what you were,
To torture you more, being what you are.
You usurped my place, and you don't
Usurp the right proportion of my sorrow?
Now your proud neck bears half of my heavy yoke;
From where even here I slide my tired neck,
And leave the burden of all this on you.
Farewell, wife of York and queen of sad misfortune:
These English misfortunes will make me smile in France.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O you who are gifted in curses, stay a while,
And teach me to curse my enemies!

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Do not sleep at night and fast during the day;
Compare dead happiness with living unhappiness;
Think your babies were prettier than them,
And he who killed them is more vile than him:
Improving your loss makes the bad person worse:
Spinning this will teach you to curse.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are boring; Oh, quicken them with yours!

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Your misfortunes will make them sharp and piercing like mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why should calamity be full of words?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
From windy lawyers to the misfortunes of their clients,
Aerial successors of intestate joys,
Poor speakers of misery who breathe!
Give them room for action: even if what they transmit
They don't help everyone, but they ease the heart.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
If so, don't be speechless: come with me.
And in the breath of bitter words we stifle
My damn son, whom your two sweet sons suffocated.
I hear his drum: be copious in shouting.

KING RICHARD III:
Who intercepts my shipment?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O the one who could have intercepted you,
By strangling you in her cursed womb
Of all the massacres, wretch, that you have committed!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Do you hide this forehead with a golden crown,
Where should we engrave, if this right were just,
The massacre of the prince who owed this crown,
And the tragic death of my two sons and brothers?
Tell me, wicked slave, where are my children?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
You toad, you toad, where is your brother Clarence?
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Where are the nice Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?

KING RICHARD III:
A boast, trumpets! sound the alarm, battery!
May the heavens not hear these revealing women
Mock the Lord's anointed: strike, I say!
Be patient, and beg me honestly,
Or with the loud sound of war
So I will cover your exclamations.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Are you my son?

KING RICHARD III:
Yes, I thank God, my father and yourself.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
So listen patiently to my impatience.

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
Which cannot bear the accent of reprimand.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Oh, let me talk!

KING RICHARD III:
Do then: but I will not hear.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will be gentle and gentle in my speech.

KING RICHARD III:
And in short, good mother; because I'm in a hurry.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Are you in such a hurry? I stayed for you,
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

KING RICHARD III:
And have I not finally come to console you?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, by the holy rood screen, you know it well,
You came to earth to make the earth my hell.
Your birth was a heavy burden for me;
Your childhood was irritable and capricious;
Your scary, desperate, wild and furious school days,
Your peak of daring, daring and adventurous manhood,
Your age confirmed, proud, submissive, bloody,
perfidious,
Gentler, but yet more harmful, kinder in hatred:
What comfortable hour can you name,
Has it ever made me happy to be in your company?

KING RICHARD III:
Well, none, except Humphrey Hour, who called
your grace
Have breakfast once I leave my company.
If I am so ashamed in your eyes,
Let me continue without offending Your Grace.
Hit the drum.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Please listen to me speak.

KING RICHARD III:
You speak too bitterly.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Listen to me a word;
Because I will never speak to you again.

KING RICHARD III:
SO.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Either you will die, by the just ordinance of God,
Before this war you become a conqueror,
Or I will perish with sorrow and extreme age
And never look at your face again.
So take with you my heaviest curse;
Who, on the day of battle, tires you more
Let all the full armor you wear!
My prayers for the fight of the opposing party;
And there the little souls of Edward's children
Whisper the spirits of your enemies
And promise them success and victory.
You are bloody, your end will be bloody;
Shame serves your life and your death accompanies it.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Although there are many more causes, but much less spirit to curse
Abide in me; I say amen to everyone.

KING RICHARD III:
Stay, madam; I have to say a word to you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I no longer have a son of royal blood
For you to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
They will be nuns in prayer, not queens in tears;
And so level so as not to clash with their lives.

KING RICHARD III:
You have a daughter called Elizabeth,
Virtuous and just, royal and gracious.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And must she die for this? Oh, let her live,
And I will corrupt her ways, stain her beauty;
Slandering me as being false to Edward's bed;
Throw the veil of infamy over her:
So that she can live without the scars of a bloody massacre,
I admit that she was not Edward's daughter.

KING RICHARD III:
This is not false about her birth, she is of royal blood.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To save her life, I'll say she's not.

KING RICHARD III:
His life is no longer secure than when he was born.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And it was only in this security that his brothers died.

KING RICHARD III:
Behold, at their birth the lucky stars were opposite.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, bad friends were contrary to their lives.

KING RICHARD III:
All that is inevitable is the catastrophe of destiny.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It is true that when it is avoided, grace makes destiny:
My babies were destined for a fairer death,
If grace had blessed you with a more beautiful life.

KING RICHARD III:
You talk like I killed my cousins.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle
Of comfort, of kingdom, of kinship, of freedom, of life.
Whose hand pierced their tender hearts,
Your head, indirectly, gave instructions:
There is no doubt that the murderous knife was dull and dull.
Until it is sharpened on your stone-hard heart,
To delight in the entrails of my lambs.
But the use of sorrow makes wild sorrow tame,
My tongue should not in your ears name my boys
Until my nails were anchored in your eyes;
And I, in a bay of death so desperate,
Like a poor boat, with sails and rigging,
Run in pieces on your rocky bosom.

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, then I flourish in my business
And the dangerous success of bloody wars,
As I intend to do more good for you and yours,
That you or yours have never been wronged by me!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What is the face of heaven for?
Can being discovered do me any good?

KING RICHARD III:
The advancement of your children, sweet lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To some scaffold, there to lose your head?

KING RICHARD III:
No, to dignity and the height of honor
The high imperial type of the glory of this land.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Flatter my sorrows by reporting it;
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honor,
Can you give in to one of my children?

KING RICHARD III:
Even everything I have; yes, and me and everything,
Will I also endow one of your children;
So in the Lethe of your angry soul
You drown the sad memory of these wrongs
What you suppose I did to you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Be brief, lest it be a process of your kindness
Lasts longer than the appointment of your kindness.

KING RICHARD III:
So know that with all my soul I love your daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My daughter's mother thinks so with her soul.

KING RICHARD III:
What do you think?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That you love my daughter with all your soul:
So with the love of your soul you loved his brothers;
And from the bottom of my heart, I thank you.

KING RICHARD III:
Don't be so hasty as to confuse my meaning:
I mean, with my soul I love your daughter,
And I want to make her Queen of England.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So say: who do you think will be its king?

KING RICHARD III:
Even the one that makes her queen, who should be otherwise?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What you ?

KING RICHARD III:
Me, even me: what do you think, madam?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How can you woo her?

KING RICHARD III:
This is how I will learn from you,
Like the one who knows his humor best.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And do you want to learn from me?

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, with all my heart.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Send him, by the man who killed his brothers,
A pair of bleeding hearts; engrave on it
Edward and York; then maybe she will cry:
So introduce him - like Margaret sometimes
I made to your father, imbued with the blood of Rutland,...
A tissue; which, tell him, drained
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
And tell him to dry his watery eyes with it.
If this incitement forces her not to love,
Send him the story of your noble deeds;
Tell him you chased away his uncle Clarence,
His uncle Rivers; yes, and, for her,
Fastest travel with his good aunt Anne.

KING RICHARD III:
Come, come, you're making fun of me; it's not like that
To win our daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There's no other way
Unless you can take another form,
And don't be Richard, the one who did all this.

KING RICHARD III:
Say I did all this out of love for her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, then indeed, she can only hate you,
Having bought love with such bloody spoils.

KING RICHARD III:
Look, what is done cannot be changed now:
Men will sometimes act recklessly,
Which, after hours, gives time to repent.
If I took the kingdom from your sons,
To make it up to you, I'll give it to your daughter.
If I killed the issue from your womb,
To accelerate your growth, I will generate
My question of your blood on your daughter
A grandmother's name is a little less loving
What is a mother's affectionate title;
They are like children but one step below,
Even of your courage, of your very blood;
Of one pain, except for a night of moaning
Endured by the one for whom you offer as sorrow.
Your children were a nuisance to your youth,
But mine will be a comfort to your age.
The loss you have is only a son being king,
And through this loss, your daughter became queen.
I can't make the repairs I would do,
So accept all the kindness I can.
Dorset your son, who has a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps into foreign soil,
This righteous alliance will quickly be called to us
To high promotions and great dignity:
The king, who calls your beautiful daughter wife.
You will familiarly call your brother Dorset;
You will be the mother of a king again,
And all the ruins of hard times
Repaired with a double wealth of content.
What! we have many beautiful days to see:
The liquid drops of tears you shed
Will return, transformed to direct the pearl,
Take advantage of their loan with interest
A tenfold increase in happiness.
Go, then my mother, go to your daughter
Highlight his shy years with your experience;
Prepare his ears to hear a courtier's story
Put in his tender heart the aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty; introduce the princess
With the sweet silent hours of the joys of marriage
And when my arm chastised
The little rebel and the stupid Buckingham,
Bound with triumphant garlands I will come
And lead your daughter to the bed of a conqueror;
To whom I will tell of my won conquest,
And she will be the only winner, the Caesar of Caesar.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What did I have best to say? his father's brother
Could this be his lord? or should I say, his uncle?
Or the one who killed his brothers and uncles?
Under what title should I court you,
May God, the law, my honor and his love,
Could this seem pleasant to his younger years?

KING RICHARD III:
Deduce the equitable peace of England by this alliance.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Which it will buy with a still lasting war.

KING RICHARD III:
Say that the king, who can command, begs.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
This in his hands, what the king of the king forbids.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, she will be a high and mighty queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To moan the tide, as its mother does.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I will love him forever.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long will this title last?

KING RICHARD III:
Slowly gaining strength until the end of his beautiful life.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long will his sweet lie last?

KING RICHARD III:
Hopefully the sky and nature lengthen it.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As hell and Richard likes it.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I, his sovereign, am his subject of love.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But she, your subject, hates such sovereignty.

KING RICHARD III:
Be eloquent in my favor to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It's best if an honest story is told clearly.

KING RICHARD III:
Then, in clear terms, tell him my love story.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The simple and not honest style is too harsh a style.

KING RICHARD III:
Your reasons are too superficial and too quick.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
Too deep and dead, poor children, in their graves.

KING RICHARD III:
No harp on this string, madam; It's from the past.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I will continue to play the harp there until the heartstrings break.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by my George, my garter and my crown,...

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Desecrated, dishonored and the third usurped.

KING RICHARD III:
I swear--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By nothing; because it is not an oath:
The desecrated George has lost his holy honor;
The garter, stained, pledged her chivalrous virtue;
The crown, usurped, dishonored its royal glory.
if you swear something to be believed,
So swear by something you have done no wrong.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, around the world...

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It's full of your horrible wrongs.

KING RICHARD III:
The death of my father...

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Your life has been dishonored.

KING RICHARD III:
Then, by myself...

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You are abusing it yourself.

KING RICHARD III:
Why then, by God...

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God's wrong is the most important.
If you had been afraid of breaking an oath he had taken,
The unity that the king your brother made
Had not been broken, nor my brother killed:
If you had been afraid of breaking an oath he had taken,
The imperial metal, now surrounding your forehead,
Had honored the tender temples of my child,
And the two princes breathed here,
And now, two tender playmates to dust,
Your broken faith has become prey for worms.
What can you swear by now?

KING RICHARD III:
The time to come.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That you have done wrong in the past;
Because I have a lot of tears to wash myself
Beyond time, for past time has been wronged by you.
The children live, whose parents you have
massacre,
Ungoverned youth, to lament him at his age;
The parents live, whose children you massacred,
Old withered plants, to lament with their age.
Do not swear by the time to come; for this you have
Misused before being used, by time misused in the past.

KING RICHARD III:
As I intend to prosper and repent,
So I prosper in my dangerous attempt
Enemy weapons! confuse myself!
Heaven and fortune forbid me happy hours!
Day, do not give me your light; nor, at night, your rest!
Be in front of all the planets of good luck
To my steps, if, with the love of a pure heart,
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
I'm not waiting for your beautiful princely daughter!
In it consist my happiness and yours;
Without her, we follow this earth and I,
To you, to herself and to many Christian souls,
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
This can only be avoided by this;
This will only be avoided by this.
This is why, good mother, I must be able to do this to you...
Be the attorney of my love for her:
Plead for what I will be, and not for what I have been;
Not my merits, but what I deserve:
Emphasize the necessity and the state of the times,
And don't be glum about big designs.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Will I be thus tempted by the devil?

KING RICHARD III:
Yes, if the devil tempts you to do good.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Should I forget myself to be myself?

KING RICHARD III:
Yes, if your memory is wrong.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But you killed my children.

KING RICHARD III:
But in the womb of your daughter I bury them:
Where in this nest of spices they will breed
Self of themselves, for your comfort.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Should I go and win my daughter to your will?

KING RICHARD III:
And be a happy mother through deeds.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I go. Write to me very soon.
And you will understand his spirit from me.

KING RICHARD III:
Give him the kiss of my true love; and then, goodbye.
Implacable fool and superficial and changeable woman!
How now! What's new?

RATCLIFF:
My gracious sovereign, on the west coast
Rides a powerful navy; to the shore
A crowd of doubtful and hollow-hearted friends,
Disarmed and unresolved to repel them:
Richmond is believed to be their admiral;
And there they cry, just waiting for help
From Buckingham to welcome them ashore.

KING RICHARD III:
A light-hearted friend sends a message to the Duke of Norfolk:
Ratcliff, yourself or Catesby; where is he?

CATESBY:
Here, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Fly to the Duke:
Station yourself in Salisbury
When you come there...
Boring and unconscious villain,
Why do you stay quiet and don't go to the duke?

CATESBY:
First of all, mighty ruler, let me know what you think,
That with your grace I will deliver him.

KING RICHARD III:
O, that's right, good Catesby: tell him to get up straight
The greatest strength and power he can create,
And find me currently in Salisbury.

CATESBY:
I go.

RATCLIFF:
What would Your Highness want me to do?
Salisbury?

KING RICHARD III:
Why, what would you do there before I leave?

RATCLIFF:
Your Highness told me I should post first.

KING RICHARD III:
I've changed my mind, sir, I've changed my mind.
And now, what news from you?

STANLEY:
Nothing good, my lord, to please you by hearing you;
Nor anything that serious, but one could well say.

KING RICHARD III:
Hello, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why do you run so many miles,
When will you be able to tell your story more closely?
Once again, what news?

STANLEY:
Richmond is on the seas.

KING RICHARD III:
There, let him flow, and be the sea on him!
White liver runagate, what is it doing there?

STANLEY:
I do not know, mighty sovereign, but I guess it.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?

STANLEY:
Stirred by Dorset, Buckingham and Ely,
He is heading to England to claim the crown.

KING RICHARD III:
Is the chair empty? is the sword unshakable?
Is the king dead? the empire dispossessed?
Which heir of York is alive besides us?
And who is the king of England if not the heir of the great York?
So tell me, what is he doing on the sea?

STANLEY:
Without this, my lord, I cannot guess.

KING RICHARD III:
Unless he becomes your liege,
You can't guess why the Welshman is coming.
You will rebel and flee to him, I fear.

STANLEY:
No, mighty lord; so don't be suspicious of me.

KING RICHARD III:
Where is your power to repel him?
Where are your tenants and your supporters?
Are they not now on the West Bank?
Drive the rebels off their ships!

STANLEY:
No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.

KING RICHARD III:
Cold friends of Richard: what are they doing in the north,
When should they serve their sovereign in the West?

STANLEY:
They were not commanded, mighty sovereign:
Please, Your Majesty give me permission,
I will gather my friends and meet your grace
Where and at what time Your Majesty pleases.

KING RICHARD III:
Aouch aouch. you would have left to join Richmond:
I won't trust you, sir.

STANLEY:
Most powerful ruler,
You have no reason to doubt my friendship:
I have never been fake and I never will be.

KING RICHARD III:
GOOD,
Go and gather men; but, listen to yourself, leave behind you
Your son, George Stanley: look, your faith be firm.
Or else the confidence of his head is fragile.

STANLEY:
So deal with it while I prove my loyalty to you.

Messenger:
My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
As my friends have told me,
Sir Edward Courtney and the Haughty Prelate
Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,
With many more Confederates, they are up in arms.

Second messenger:
My lord, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
And every hour more competitors
Act to their aid, and their power continues to increase.

Third messenger:
My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham...

KING RICHARD III:
It’s your turn, owls! nothing but death songs?
Take this, until you bring me better news.

Third messenger:
The news I must announce to Your Majesty
That is, through flash floods and waterfalls,
Buckingham's army is scattered and dispersed;
And he himself went away alone,
Nobody knows where.

KING RICHARD III:
I cry out to you for mercy:
Here is my purse to treat your injury.
A wise friend proclaimed
Reward for the one who brings the traitor?

Third messenger:
Such a proclamation has been made, my lord.

Fourth Messenger:
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquess Dorset,
They say, my lord, that in Yorkshire we are in arms.
Yet this good comfort brings me to your grace,
The Breton navy is scattered by the storm:
Richmond, Yorkshire, sent a boat
To the shore, to ask those on the banks
Whether they were his assistants, yes or no;
Those who answered him came from Buckingham.
To his side: he, distrusting them,
Sail hoisted and departure for Brittany.

KING RICHARD III:
Walk, walk, since we are armed;
If not to fight foreign enemies,
However, we must defeat these rebels here at home.

CATESBY:
My liege, the Duke of Buckingham, is taken;
This is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
Has a mighty power landed in Milford,
The news is colder, but it must be announced.

KING RICHARD III:
On the way to Salisbury! while we reason here,
A battle royale could be won and lost
Someone orders Buckingham brought
In Salisbury; the others walk with me.

DERBY:
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this for me:
Than in the stable of this bloodiest boar
My son George Stanley is franked in the hold:
If I rebel, young George's head goes;
The fear of this holds back my current help.
But tell me, where is Prince Richmond now?

CHRISTOPHE:
In Pembroke, or in Harford-west, Wales.

DERBY:
Which famous men use him?

CHRISTOPHE:
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
Oxford, Pembroke Redoubt, Sir James Blunt,
And Rice ap Thomas with a gallant crew;
And many others of noble fame and value:
And towards London they bend their course,
If, moreover, they are not fought.

DERBY:
Return to your lord; recommend me to him:
Tell him that the queen has heartily consented
He will marry Elisabeth, his daughter.
These letters will put him out of my mind. Farewell.

BUCKINGHAM:
Won't King Richard let me speak to him?

Sheriff:
No, my good lord; so be patient.

BUCKINGHAM:
Hastings and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry and your son-in-law Edward,
Vaughan, and all that had a miscarriage
By a sneaky and corrupt injustice,
If these are your sullen and discontented souls
Through the clouds, contemplate this present hour,
Even to avenge me, mock my destruction!
It's All Saints' Day, folks, isn't it?

Sheriff:
It is true, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then All Saints' Day is my body's doomsday.
It is the day when, in the time of King Edward,
I wish it didn't fall on me when I was found
False to his children or his wife's allies
This is the day I wish I fell
It was through his false faith that I had the most confidence;
This, this day for all souls for my fearful soul
Will the determined respite from my wrongs:
This great All-Seer with whom I lingered
Spilled my false prayer on my head
And I seriously gave what I jokingly asked for.
This is how he forces the swords of the wicked
To turn their own arguments on the bosom of their masters:
Now Margaret's curse has fallen upon my head;
“When he,” she said, “breaks your heart with sorrow,
Remember that Margaret was a prophetess.
Come, gentlemen, lead me to the block of shame;
Evil only has evil, and blame whoever is due to blame.

RICHMOND:
Companions in arms and my most loving friends,
Bruised under the yoke of tyranny,
So far in the bowels of the earth
Did we walk without obstacle?
And we receive here from our father Stanley
Fair lines of reassurance and encouragement.
The miserable, bloody and usurping boar,
It has spoiled your summer fields and your fruitful vines,
Makes your warm blood flow like a wash and makes its hollow
In your interlocking breasts, this dirty pig
Now stands in the very center of this island,
Near the town of Leicester, as we learn
From Tamworth it is only a day's walk.
In the name of God, good courage, courageous friends,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
By this bloody ordeal of a fierce war.

OXFORD:
Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
To fight against this damn homicide.

HERBERT:
I don't doubt it, but his friends will fly to us.

BLUNT:
He has no friends who are friends out of fear.
Which, in his greatest need, will withdraw from him.

RICHMOND:
All this for our benefit. So, in the name of God, walk:
True hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings:
Kings make gods and more wicked creatures kings.

KING RICHARD III:
Here let us pitch our tents, even here, in the field of Bosworth.
My Lord of Surrey, why do you look so sad?

SURREY:
My heart is ten times lighter than my appearance.

KING RICHARD III:
Monsignor of Norfolk,...

NORFOLK:
Here, very kind Liège.

KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, we must have shots; Ha! is not it ?

NORFOLK:
We must give and receive, my gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Pitch my tent there! I'm going to bed here tonight;
But where tomorrow? Well, it's all one for that.
Who knew the number of the enemy?

NORFOLK:
Six or seven thousand is their greatest power.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, our battalion triples that account:
Moreover, the king's name is a tower of strength,
What they want from the opposing party.
Pitch my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
Let's look at home advantage
Call for men of good leadership
We don't want any discipline, let's not delay,
Because, lords, tomorrow will be a busy day.

RICHMOND:
The tired sun made a golden sunset,
And by the luminous trace of his flaming car,
Gives the signal of a beautiful day tomorrow.
Sir William Brandon, you will carry my standard.
Give me ink and paper in my tent
I will draw the shape and pattern of our battle,
Limit each leader to his different charges,
And share our little strength in fair proportion.
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
The Earl of Pembroke guards his regiment:
Good Captain Blunt, bid him good night
And from the second hour in the morning
Want the count to see me in my tent:
One more thing, good Blunt, before you go,
Where is Lord Stanley, do you know?

BLUNT:
Unless I was very wrong about its colors,
Which I am sure I did not do,
His regiment is at least 800 meters away
South of the mighty power of the king.

RICHMOND:
If this is possible without danger,
Good Captain Blunt, bid him good evening,
And give him this essential parchment for me.

BLUNT:
On my life, my lord, I take charge of it;
And so, God give you a peaceful rest this night!

RICHMOND:
Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
Let's consult on tomorrow's business
In our tent; the air is raw and cold.

KING RICHARD III:
It's not time?

CATESBY:
It is dinner time, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

KING RICHARD III:
I won't have supper tonight.
Give me some ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armor left in my tent?

CATESBY:
If so, my lord; and everything is ready.

KING RICHARD III:
Good Norfolk, at your charge;
Be attentive, choose reliable sentries.

NORFOLK:
I'm going, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Mix with the lark tomorrow, nice Norfolk.

NORFOLK:
I guarantee it to you, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

CATESBY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Send an armed pursuer
To Stanley's regiment; tell him to bring his power
Before sunrise, lest her son George fall
In the blind cave of eternal night.
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddle the white Surrey for the field tomorrow.
Make sure my poles are sturdy and not too heavy.
Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Have you seen the melancholy Lord Northumberland?

RATCLIFF:
Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,
A lot about the time the taps are turned off, from troop to troop
I walked through the army, encouraging the soldiers.

KING RICHARD III:
So, I'm satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
I don't have this eagerness of mind,
Nor the joy of life that I used to have.
Drop it off. Are the ink and paper ready?

RATCLIFF:
It is true, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Tell my guard to keep watch; leave me.
Ratcliff, in the middle of the night, come to my tent
And help me arm myself. Leave me, I said.

DERBY:
Fortune and victory are on your helmet!

RICHMOND:
All the comfort that the dark night can offer
Be kind to yourself, noble father-in-law!
Tell me, how is our beloved mother?

DERBY:
I, by lawyer, bless you on behalf of your mother
Who continually prays for the good of Richmond:
So much for that. The silent hours pass,
And flaky darkness rises in the east.
In short, because this is what the season asks of us,
Prepare your fight early in the morning,
And put your fortune to arbitration
Bloody blows and breathtaking war.
Me, as I can, what I would like, I cannot,
With the best advantage we will deceive time,
And help you in this dubious clash of arms:
But on your side I'm perhaps not too forward
Lest being seen, your brother, tender George,
Being executed before his father's eyes.
Farewell: Leisure and Scary Times
Cut ceremonial vows of love
And many exchanges of sweet speeches,
On which friends so long separated should dwell:
God gives us leisure for these rites of love!
Once again, farewell: be brave and run well!

RICHMOND:
Good lords, lead him to his regiment:
I will try, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
Lest a heavy sleep bore me tomorrow,
When I should ride with wings of victory:
Once again, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
O You, whose captain I consider myself to be,
Look at my strength with a kind eye;
Put your irons bruised with anger into their hands,
That they may crash in a heavy fall
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
Make us your ministers of punishment,
So that we can praise you in victory!
I entrust my vigilant soul to you,
Before I let the windows fall from my eyes:
Sleeping and waking, oh, defend me again!

Ghost of Prince Edward:

Ghost of King Henry VI:

Ghost of CLARENCE:

Ghost of RIVIÈRES:

Ghost of GRAY:

Ghost of VAUGHAN:

All:

Ghost of HASTINGS:

Ghosts of the young Princes:

Ghost of DAME ANNE:

Ghost of BUCKINGHAM:

KING RICHARD III:
Give me another horse: heal my wounds.
Have mercy, Jesus!--Gentle! I only dreamed.
O let go of conscience, how you afflict me!
The lights glow blue. It is now dead midnight.
Cold, frightening drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What am I afraid of? myself? there is no one else by:
Richard loves Richard; that is to say, I am me.
Is there a murderer here? No. Yes I am :
So fly. What, about myself? Excellent reason why:
Lest I take revenge. What, myself on myself?
A lack. I love myself. For this reason? for all good
What did I do to myself?
Oh no! alas, I rather hate myself
For heinous acts committed by myself!
I am a villain: yet I lie. I'm not.
Fool, speak well of yourself; foolish, do not flatter.
My conscience has a thousand languages,
And each language brings several stories,
And every tale condemns me as a villain.
Perjury, perjury, to the highest degree
Murder, contained murder, to the most extreme degree;
All sins, all used in every degree,
Crowd at the bar, everyone shouting: Guilty! guilty!
I will despair. No creature loves me;
And if I die, no one will pity me:
No, why should they, since it's me
Do I not find any pity for myself?
I thought the souls of all those I had murdered
I came to my tent; and everyone threatened
Tomorrow's revenge on Richard's head.

RATCLIFF:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
“Zounds!” Who is here?

RATCLIFF:
Ratcliff, my lord; it's me. The first rooster in the village
Twice saluted in the morning;
Your friends are standing and strapping on their armor.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I had a fearful dream!
What do you think, will our friends prove that everything is true?

RATCLIFF:
Without a doubt, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear...

RATCLIFF:
No, my good lord, do not be afraid of the shadows.

KING RICHARD III:
By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight
Sowed even more terror in Richard's soul
Than the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed to the test and led by shallow Richmond.
The day is not yet near. Come, come with me;
Under our tents, I will play trickle-down,
To see if anyone wants to turn away from me.

LORDS:
Hello, Richmond!

RICHMOND:
Cry for mercy, vigilant lords and gentlemen,
That you have caught a lazy sloth here.

LORDS:
How did you sleep, my lord?

RICHMOND:
The sweetest sleep and the most promising dreams
Who ever entered a sleepy head,
I have had it since your departure, my lords.
I thought that their souls, whose bodies Richard had murdered,
I came to my tent and shouted in victory:
I promise you, my soul is very joyful
In memory of such a beautiful dream.
How far is it morning, lords?

LORDS:
Around four o'clock.

RICHMOND:
Well, then it's time to arm yourself and give direction.
More than I said, dear compatriots,
Leisure and the application of time
It is forbidden to linger there: but remember this,
God and our good cause fight alongside us;
The prayers of saints and wronged souls,
Like ramparts with a lofty rear, stand before our faces;
Richard except, those against whom we fight
We would rather win than follow him:
Why are they being followed? truly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
One raised in the blood, and the other established in the blood;
He who has found the means to come with what he has,
And he massacred those who were the means of helping him;
Filthy and debased stone, made precious by aluminum foil
From the English chair, where he is falsely seated;
The one who has always been the enemy of God:
So if you fight against the enemy of God,
God will protect you in justice like his soldiers;
If you sweat to take down a tyrant,
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being killed;
If you fight the enemies of your country,
The fat of your country will pay the wages of your toils;
If you fight for the protection of your women,
Your women will welcome the conquerors into their homes;
If you free your children from the sword,
Your children's children stopped it at your age.
So, in the name of God and all these rights,
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
For me, the price of my daring attempt
It will be this cold corpse on the cold face of the earth;
But if I succeed, the gain of my attempt
The least among you will share his share.
Sound the drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!

KING RICHARD III:
What did Northumberland say affected Richmond?

RATCLIFF:
That he was never trained in the use of weapons.

KING RICHARD III:
He told the truth: and what then did Surrey say?

RATCLIFF:
He smiled and said, “It’s better for our purpose.” »

KING RICHARD III:
He was right ; and this is indeed the case.
It's ten o'clock. Give me a timeline.
Who saw the sun today?

RATCLIFF:
Not me, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
So he disdains to shine; for the book
He should have braved the East an hour ago
It will be a dark day for someone. Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
We won't see the sun today;
The sky frowns and turns towards our army.
I wish these pink tears came from the ground.
No shine today! Why, what does it do to me
More than in Richmond? for the same paradise
The one who frowns at me looks at him sadly.

NORFOLK:
Arms, arms, my lord; the enemy boasts on the ground.

KING RICHARD III:
Come, agitation, agitation; caparison my horse.
Call Lord Stanley, ask him to bring his power:
I will lead my soldiers into the plain,
And thus my battle will be ordered:
My front will be stretched to its full length,
Composed of equal parts horse and foot;
Our archers will be placed in the middle
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
Must be at the head of this foot and this horse.
Thus they led, we will follow
In the main battle, whose power each side
Must be well winged with our main horse.
This, and Saint George to boot! What do you think, Norfolk?

NORFOLK:
Good leadership, warrior sovereign.
This found me on my tent this morning.

KING RICHARD III:

Messenger:
Monsignor, he refuses to come.

KING RICHARD III:
Take off his son George's head!

NORFOLK:
My lord, the enemy has passed the swamp
After the battle, let George Stanley die.

KING RICHARD III:
A thousand hearts are big in my bosom:
Advance our standards, imposed on our enemies
Our ancient word of courage, beautiful Saint George,
Inspire us with the spleen of fire dragons!
On them! victory is on our rudders.

CATESBY:
Save, my lord of Norfolk, save, save!
The king does more wonders than a man,
Dare to do the opposite in the face of any danger:
His horse is killed, and he fights on foot,
Searching for Richmond in Death Gorge.
Save yourself, fair lord, or else the day is lost!

KING RICHARD III:
Horse! horse! my kingdom for a horse!

CATESBY:
Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you ride a horse.

KING RICHARD III:
Slave, I put my life on a plaster,
And I will bear the risk of death:
I think there are six Richmonds on the field;
I killed five today in his place.
Horse! horse! my kingdom for a horse!

RICHMOND:
Praise be to God and your arms, victorious friends,
The day is ours, the damn dog is dead.

DERBY:
Brave Richmond, you have acquitted yourself well.
Here, here, is this long-usurped royalty
Dead temples of this damn wretch
Have I torn off, to adorn your forehead:
Wear it, enjoy it and enjoy it.

RICHMOND:
Great God of heaven, say Amen to everyone!
But tell me, is young George Stanley alive?

DERBY:
He is, my lord, safe in the city of Leicester;
Where, if it pleases you, we can now withdraw.

RICHMOND:
Which men of note are killed on each side?

DERBY:
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon.

RICHMOND:
Between their bodies as befits their births:
Proclaim forgiveness to fleeing soldiers
This will come back to us in submission:
And then, as we took the sacrament,
We will unite the white rose and the red:
Smile heaven at this beautiful conjunction,
They have long disapproved of their enmity!
What traitor hears me and says no amen?
England has long been mad and scarred herself;
A brother has shed his brother's blood blindly,
The father recklessly slaughtered his own son,
The son, forced, was massacred for the father:
All this divided York and Lancaster,
Divided in their terrible division,
Oh, now that Richmond and Elizabeth,
The true successors of each royal house,
By the righteous ordinance of God, unite!
And may their heirs, God, if you wish.
Enrich the time to come with gentle-faced peace,
With lots of smiles and fair and prosperous days!
Reduce the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
This would further reduce these bloody days,
And make poor England cry in floods of blood!
Let them not live to taste the increase of this earth
It would be, through treason, to harm the peace of this beautiful country!
Now the civilian injuries are stopped, peace returns:
So that she can live here for a long time, God says amen!

KING RICHARD II:
Old John of Gaunt, revered Lancaster,
Have you, according to your oath and your covenant,
I have brought here Henry Hereford, your bold son,
Here to compensate for the loud and late call,
What our leisure time would not allow us to hear,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

JEAN DE GANT:
Yes my Lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Tell me, moreover, have you probed it,
If he appeals to the Duke on an old wickedness;
Or with dignity, as a good subject should do,
On some known motive for treason?

JEAN DE GANT:
As far as I have been able to examine this argument,
On an apparent danger seen in him
Intended for Your Highness, without inveterate malice.

KING RICHARD II:
Then call them into our presence; face to face,
And frowning we ourselves will hear
The accuser and the accused speak freely:
They are high-bellied and full of anger,
Angry, dull like the sea, pressed like fire.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Many years of happy days have come
My gracious sovereign, my most loving overlord!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Every day further improves the happiness of others;
Until the heavens, envying the happiness of the earth,
Add an immortal title to your crown!

KING RICHARD II:
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
This is also evident by the reason why you come;
Namely to appeal for high treason.
Cousin of Hereford, what do you oppose
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
First, may heaven be the record of my speech!
In the dedication of a subject's love,
Ensuring the precious safety of my prince,
And free from other ill-begotten hatreds,
Come, I call upon this princely presence.
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to you,
And notice my greeting carefully; for what I'm talking about
My body will do good on this earth,
Or my divine soul will answer it in heaven.
You are a traitor and a disbeliever,
Too beautiful to be and too bad to live,
Since the more beautiful and crystalline the sky is,
The uglier the clouds flying there seem.
Again, to make the rating even worse,
With the name of a vile traitor, I stuff your throat;
And I wish, so please my sovereign, before I move,
What my tongue says, my right sword can prove.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Let my cold words not accuse my zeal:
This is not the test of a women's war,
The bitter clamor of two eager tongues,
Can arbitrate this cause between the two of us;
The blood is hot and it must be cooled for this:
Yet may I not boast of such tamed patience
As for keeping quiet and saying nothing at all:
First, Your Highness's righteous reverence slows me down
To give reins and spurs to my freedom of expression;
Who else would post until he got back
These terms of betrayal were repeated down his throat.
Setting aside the royalty of his high blood,
And he is not related to my liege,
I challenge him and spit on him;
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
To maintain it, I would give it chances,
And I'll meet him, if I was tied up to run on foot
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
Or any other habitable land,
Wherever an Englishman dared to set foot.
In the meantime, let this defend my loyalty,
Despite all my hopes, he lies very falsely.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Coward pale and trembling, there I throw my pledge,
Denying here the king's kinship,
And set aside the royalty of my high blood,
It's fear, not respect, that forces you to exclude him.
If guilty fear left you with so much strength
As for taking the pawn of my honor, then stoop:
By this and by all other rites of chivalry,
Will I do good against you, arm to arm,
What I said, or you can imagine worse.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
I take it; and by this sword I swear
Who gently placed my knighthood on my shoulder,
I will answer you to a certain extent,
Or chivalrous conception of a chivalrous trial:
And when I go up, let me not light up alive,
If I am a traitor or if I fight unfairly!

KING RICHARD II:
What does our cousin blame Mowbray for?
It must be great to be able to inherit us
So much evil thought in him.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Listen, what I say, my life will prove true;
That Mowbray received eight thousand nobles
In the name of loans for Your Highness's soldiers,
The one he detained for obscene jobs,
Like a false traitor and an insulting villain.
Besides, I say it and I will prove it in battle,
Or here or elsewhere to the farthest edge
This has never been examined by the English eye,
That all the betrayals of these eighteen years
Plotted and contrived in this country
Collect their first head and spring from the fake Mowbray.
Moreover I say and I will maintain further
On his bad life to make it all good,
That he plotted the death of the Duke of Gloucester,
Suggest to his adversaries who soon believe,
And therefore, like a cowardly traitor,
He drained his innocent soul through streams of blood:
What blood, like that of Abel's sacrifice, weeps,
Even from the silent caverns of the earth,
Mine for justice and severe punishment;
And, by the glorious valor of my descendants,
This arm will do it, or this life will be gone.

KING RICHARD II:
How high his resolve rises!
Thomas of Norfolk, what do you say to that?

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
O, let my sovereign turn away his face
And strain his ears for a moment so that he is deaf,
Until I told this slander on his blood,
How God and good men hate such a vile liar.

KING RICHARD II:
Mowbray, our eyes and ears are impartial:
Was he my brother, or even the heir to my kingdom,
As he is only my father's brother's son,
Now, through the fear of my scepter, I make a vow,
Such closeness to our sacred blood
Nothing should privilege it, nor partialize it
The unwavering firmness of my right soul:
He is our subject, Mowbray; you too :
I allow you freedom of speech and fearlessness.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
So, Bolingbroke, as low as your heart,
Through the false passage of your throat, you lie.
Three parts of this receipt that I had for Calais
I duly paid it to His Highness's soldiers;
The other part is reserved for me by consent,
For this my sovereign overlord was my debt
On the rest of a dear account,
Since the last time I went to France to look for its queen:
Now swallow this lie. For Gloucester's death,
I didn't kill him; but to my great shame
I have neglected my duty in this matter.
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
The honorable father of my enemy
I once ambushed your life,
An intrusion that vexes my afflicted soul
But before I receive the sacrament for the last time
I confessed it and I exactly begged
Your Grace's forgiveness, and I hope I have had it.
It's my fault: for the rest, I appealed,
It comes from a wicked man's grudge,
A recreating and most degenerate traitor
What I will boldly defend in myself;
And I throw my gauge interchangeably
On the foot of this insolent traitor,
To prove that I'm a faithful gentleman
Even in the best blood contained in her breast.
In haste, I pray with all my heart
Your Highness to award our trial day.

KING RICHARD II:
Gentlemen inflamed with anger, be governed by me;
Let's purge this anger without letting blood flow:
This is what we prescribe, but without a doctor;
Deep malice makes an incision too deep;
Forget to forgive; conclude and be agreed;
Our doctors say this is not a month to bleed.
Good uncle, may it end where it began;
We will calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.

JEAN DE GANT:
Being a peacemaker will become my age:
Throw away, my son, the gauge of the Duke of Norfolk.

KING RICHARD II:
And Norfolk, throw his.

JEAN DE GANT:
When, Harry, when?
Obedience Bids I shouldn't bid anymore.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, throw it away, we bid; there is no start.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
I throw myself, formidable sovereign, at your feet.
You will command my life, but not my shame:
The one I owe to my duty; but my beautiful name,
Despite the death that lives on my grave,
You will not resort to dark dishonor.
I am here disgraced, indicted and disconcerted,
Pierced to the soul by the venomous spear of slander,
The one that no balm can heal except his heart and his blood
Who breathed this poison.

KING RICHARD II:
We must resist rage:
Give me his gauge: lions tame leopards.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Yes, but don't change your places: only take my shame.
And I resign my pledge. My dear dear lord,
The purest treasure mortal times offer
It's an unblemished reputation: it's far away,
Men are nothing but golden clay or painted clay.
A jewel in a chest crossed ten times
He is a bold spirit in a faithful heart.
My honor is my life; the two grow into one:
Take honor from me, and my life is over:
So, dear my liege, let me try;
In this I live and for this I will die.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, throw up your gauge; do you start.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
Should I appear discouraged to my father?
Or with pale fear of the beggar, destroy my waist
Before this extraordinary bastard? Before my tongue
Will hurt my honor with such a slight wrong,
Or it seems so vulgar that my teeth will tear
The servile motive of renouncing fear,
And spit it out bleeding in its great disgrace,
Where shame hides, even before Mowbray's face.

KING RICHARD II:
We are not born to pursue, but to command;
And since we can't make you friends,
Be ready, for your lives will respond,
In Coventry, on Saint Lambert's Day:
There your swords and your spears will arbitrate
The growing difference of your installed hatred:
Since we cannot atone for you, we will see
Justice designs the chivalry of the victor.
Lord Marshal, command our officers at arms
Be prepared to direct those home alarms.

JEAN DE GANT:
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
Requests me more than your cries,
Get agitated against the butchers of your life!
But since the correction is in these hands
What made the mistake that cannot be corrected,
Let us leave our quarrel to the will of heaven;
Who, when they see the ripe hours on earth,
A burning vengeance will fall on the heads of the offenders.

DUCHESS:
Does he not find in you a sharper brotherhood?
Has the love in your old blood no living fire?
Edward's seven sons, one of whom is yourself,
Were like seven vials of his sacred blood,
Or seven beautiful branches springing from a single root:
Some of these seven are dried by nature,
Some of these branches cut by the Fates;
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
A vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
A flourishing branch from its most royal root,
Is cracked, and all the precious liquor spilled,
Is hacked, and its summer leaves are all withered,
By the hand of envy and the bloody ax of murder.
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was yours! this bed, this belly,
This metal, this self-modeling, which shaped you
I made him a man; and even though you live and breathe,
Yet you are killed in him: you consent
To a large extent when your father died,
In that you see your unfortunate brother die,
Who was the model of your father's life.
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
By allowing your brother to be massacred,
You show the bare path of your life,
Teaching Severe Murder How to Slaughter You:
What among evil men we call patience
It is a pale and cold cowardice in noble breasts.
What should I say ? to save your own life,
The best way is to avenge the death of my Gloucester.

JEAN DE GANT:
The quarrel belongs to God; for God's substitute,
His deputy anointed in his eyes,
Caused his death: if wrongly,
May heaven take revenge; because I will never be able to lift
An angry arm against his minister.

DUCHESS:
Where then, alas, can I complain?

JEAN DE GANT:
To God, the champion and defense of the widow.

DUCHESS:
Well, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
You go to Coventry, there to see
Our cousin Hereford and the deceased Mowbray are fighting:
Oh, lay my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
So he can get into the butcher Mowbray's chest!
Or, if misfortune misses the first career,
May Mowbray's sins be so heavy in his bosom,
They could break the back of his foaming steed,
And throws the rider headlong into the lists,
A caitiff recreating my Hereford cousin!
Farewell, old Gaunt: your brother's wife sometimes
Along with his companion, grief must end his life.

JEAN DE GANT:
My sister, farewell; I have to go to Coventry:
You might as well stay with you as come with me!

DUCHESS:
One more word: sorrow leaps where it falls,
Not with emptiness, but with weight:
I take my leave before I have started,
Because grief doesn't end when it seems over.
Recommend me to your brother, Edmund York.
That's all: no, but don't go like that;
Although that's all, don't leave so quickly;
I will remember it more. Tell him...ah, what?...
Pay me a hasty visit at Plashy's.
Alas, and what will good old York see there?
But empty dwellings and unfurnished walls,
Deserted offices, unexplored stones?
And what do you hear as a welcome if not my groans?
Congratulate me then; let him not come there,
To search for the sorrow that dwells everywhere.
Sorry, sorry, will I go away and die:
Your last leave takes my eye to tears.

Lord Marshal:
Milord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford armed?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yes, in every way; and aspires to enter it.

Lord Marshal:
The Duke of Norfolk, lively and bold,
All that remains is the call of the caller's trumpet.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Why then the champions are prepared and stay
For nothing other than the approach of His Majesty.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, request from that champion over there
The cause of his arrival here in arms:
Ask him his name and proceed in an orderly manner
To swear him to the justice of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
In the name of God and the king, say who you are
And why do you come thus chivalrous, clad in weapons,
Against what man you come, and what is your quarrel:
Speak sincerely of your chivalry and your oath;
So defend the sky and your worth!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
Who came here bound by my oath?
God forbid, a knight should rape! -
Both to defend my loyalty and my truth
To God, my king and my successor,
Against the Duke of Hereford I like it
And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
To prove to him, by defending myself,
A traitor to my God, my king and me:
And since I'm really fighting, defend me, heavens!

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, ask this knight-at-arms,
Who he is and why he comes here
Thus plated in war attire,
And formally, according to our law,
Depose him to the righteousness of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
What is your name ? and why do you come here,
Before King Richard in his royal lists?
Who are you coming against? and what is your quarrel?
Speak like a true knight, so defend yourself, heavens!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby
Am I; who are ready here to take up arms,
To prove, by the grace of God and the worth of my body,
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
That he is a traitor, filthy and dangerous,
To the God of heaven, to King Richard and to me;
And since I'm really fighting, defend me, heavens!

Lord Marshal:
Under penalty of death, no one will be so bold
Or bold to touch the lists,
Except the marshal and the other officers
Appointed to lead these righteous designs.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lord Marshal, allow me to kiss the hand of my sovereign,
And bow the knee before his majesty:
For Mowbray and I are like two men
This vow is a long and painful pilgrimage;
So let's take a ceremonial leave
And affectionate farewell to our many friends.

Lord Marshal:
The caller, in all duty, salutes Your Highness,
And wants to kiss your hand and take his leave.

KING RICHARD II:
We will go down and take him in our arms.
Cousin of Hereford, how just is your cause,
So be your fortune in this royal battle!
Farewell, my blood; and if today you pour,
We can lament, but we cannot avenge our dead.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O let no noble eye desecrate a tear
For me, if I am gored by Mowbray's spear:
As confident as the flight of the falcon
Against a bird, I fight with Mowbray.
My dear lord, I take leave of you;
From you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
Not sick, even if I deal with death,
But vigorous, young and breathing happily.
Lo, as in English festivals, then I regret
The last one, the most delicate, to make the ending the sweetest:
O you, the earthly author of my blood,
Whose youthful spirit regenerates in me,
With double vigor he lifts me
To achieve victory above my head,
Add proof to my armor with your prayers;
And with your blessings strengthen the tip of my spear,
So that he may enter Mowbray's wax cloak,
And renew the name of John a Gaunt,
Even in his son's vigorous behavior.

JEAN DE GANT:
God, in your good cause, make you prosperous!
Be lightning fast in execution;
And that your blows, doubly redoubled,
Falls like incredible thunder on the helmet
From your pernicious enemy:
Awaken your youthful blood, be valiant and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My innocence and Saint George to prosper!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
However God or fortune chose me,
There lives or dies, faithful to the throne of King Richard,
A loyal, fair and honest gentleman:
Never captive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace yourself
His golden and uncontrolled emancipation,
More than my dancing soul celebrates
This battle party with my opponent.
Most powerful overlord, and my fellow peers,
Take the wish for happy years out of my mouth:
As sweet and as joyful as a joke
I will fight: the truth has a quiet breast.

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, my lord: I safely consider
Virtue with valor lying in your eyes.
Order the trial, Commissioner, and begin.

Lord Marshal:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
Receive your spear; and God defends the right!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Strong as a tower of hope, I cry amen.

Lord Marshal:
Take this spear to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.

First Herald:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,
Under penalty of being found false and recreating,
To prove that the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
A traitor to his God, to his king and to him;
And challenges him to fight.

Second Herald:
Here stands Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
Under penalty of being found false and recreating,
Both to defend and to approve
Henry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;
With courage and with free desire
Waiting for the signal to begin.

Lord Marshal:
Sound, trumpets; and put yourselves forward, fighters.
Stay, the king has overthrown his guardian.

KING RICHARD II:
Let them rest by their helmets and their spears,
And both return to their chair:
Depart with us: and let the trumpets sound
While we render to these dukes what we decree.
Get closer,
And list what we did with our council.
So that the land of our kingdom is not defiled
With this dear blood that he nourished;
And because our eyes hate the disastrous appearance
Civilian wounds plowed with neighbors' swords;
And because we believe that eagle-winged pride
Of ambitious and ambitious thoughts,
With a desire that hates rivals, I attack you
To awaken our peace, which in the cradle of our country
Inhale the sweet infant breath of sweet sleep;
Who woke up so to loud and out of tune drums,
With the terrible braying of trumpets,
And the grinding shock of angry iron arms,
From our quiet confines could we frighten a just peace
And make us wade even in the blood of our brothers,
This is why we ban you from our territories:
You, cousin Hereford, on pain of death,
Until twice five summers have enriched our fields
I will not regret our beautiful estates,
But follow the strange paths of banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Your will will be done: this must be my consolation,
The sun that warms you here will shine on me;
And those that its golden rays have lent you here
Must point the finger at me and gild my banishment.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, for you remains a heavier fate,
What I say, reluctantly:
Slow and sneaky hours won't determine
The dateless limit of your dear exile;
The desperate word “never come back”
I breathe against you, under penalty of living.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
A heavy sentence, my very sovereign overlord,
And all this was unexpected from the mouth of Your Highness:
A more expensive merit, a less profound mutilation
As for being thrown into the common air,
Have I deserved in the hands of Your Highness.
The language I learned for forty years,
My native English I must now give up:
And now my tongue is no longer useful to me
Than a viol without strings or a harp,
Or like a cunning instrument locked up,
Or, being opened, put into his hands
Who knows no key to tune harmony:
In my mouth you locked my tongue,
Doubly harrowed with my teeth and my lips;
And sterile, insensitive, boring ignorance
It's my jailer who takes care of me.
I'm too old to worship a nurse,
Too far in years to be a student now:
What then is your sentence but a voiceless death,
What prevents my tongue from breathing its native breath?

KING RICHARD II:
It disgusts you not to be compassionate:
After our sentence, the complaint comes too late.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
So thus I turn away from the light of my country,
Inhabiting the solemn nuances of an endless night.

KING RICHARD II:
Come back and take the oath with you.
Place your banished hands on our royal sword;
Swear by your duty to God...
We share our role with you.
To respect the oath we take:
You never will, so help yourself, the truth and God!
Embrace the love of the other in banishment;
Never look each other in the face either;
Neither ever write, regret, nor reconcile
This sinister storm of your native hatred;
Nor ever for a recommended purpose
To plot, invent or plot any evil
“Against us, our state, our subjects or our land.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I swear.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
And me, to keep it all.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Norfolk, regarding the mining enemy: -
At that time, if the king had allowed us,
One of our souls had wandered through the air.
Banished this frail sepulcher of our flesh,
As now our flesh is banished from this country:
Confess your betrayals before fleeing the kingdom;
Since you have to go far, don't bear
The obstructing burden of a guilty soul.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were a traitor,
May my name be erased from the book of life,
And I was banished from heaven as well as from here!
But what you are, God, you and I know;
And all too soon, I fear, the king will regret it.
Farewell, my lord. Now I can no longer go astray;
Go back to England, the world is my way.

KING RICHARD II:
Uncle, even in the glasses of your eyes
I see your afflicted heart: your sad appearance
Of the number of his years of banishment
I tore off four.
Six frozen winters passed,
Come back with welcome home after banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How much time fits in a little word!
Four winters late and four springs free
Let us end in a word: such is the breath of kings.

JEAN DE GANT:
I thank my liege, that as far as I am concerned
It shortens my son's four years of exile:
But I will get little benefit from it;
Because, before the six years he must spend
Can change their moons and advance their times
My lamp dried up in oil and my light lost in time
Must fade with age and endless night;
My cone thumb will be burned and finished,
And blindfolded death won't let me see my son.

KING RICHARD II:
Well, uncle, you have many years to live.

JEAN DE GANT:
But not a minute, king, that you can give:
You can shorten my days with sullen sorrow,
And take away nights from me, but do not lend a tomorrow;
You can stop time from crossing me with age,
But stops no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;
Your word is current with him for my death,
But dead, your kingdom cannot buy my breath.

KING RICHARD II:
Your son is banished on good advice,
To which your tongue gave a party verdict:
Why do you seem to complain about our justice?

JEAN DE GANT:
Things sweet in taste turn out to be sour in digestion.
You pressed me as judge; but I would have preferred
You would have asked me to talk like a father.
Oh, if it was a stranger, not my child,
To soften his fault, I should have been gentler:
I was trying to avoid partial slander,
And in that sentence, my own life is destroyed.
Alas, I looked when some of you said:
I was too strict to enforce mine;
But you gave leave to my reluctant tongue
Against my will to do this harm to myself.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, tell him:
We'll ban him for six years and he'll go away.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
From where you stand, let the paper appear.

Lord Marshal:
Monsignor, I will not leave you; because I will go up,
As far as the earth allows me, at your side.

JEAN DE GANT:
O, for what purpose do you accumulate your words,
That you don't respond to your friends?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I have too little to take leave of you,
When the language office should be lavish
Breathe the abundant pain of the heart.

JEAN DE GANT:
Your sorrow is only your absence for a time.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Joy absent, sorrow is present for that moment.

JEAN DE GANT:
What are six winters? they quickly left.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
To men in joy; but the sorrow lasts an hour and ten.

JEAN DE GANT:
Call it a trip you take for fun.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My heart will sigh when I call it that,
Which finds it a forced pilgrimage.

JEAN DE GANT:
The sullen passage of your tired steps
Estimate like the foil you have to put in
The precious jewel of your return home.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
No, rather, every tedious step I take
I will remember myself, what a worldly affair
I'm moving away from the jewelry I love.
Don't I have to do a long apprenticeship
At foreign passages, and at the end,
Having my freedom, I boast of nothing else
But that I was a companion of mourning?

JEAN DE GANT:
All the places visited by the eye of heaven
Are for the wise ports and happy refuges.
Teach your necessity to reason thus;
There is no virtue like necessity.
Don't think that the king has banished you,
But you, the king. Woe to the heaviest seated,
Where he perceives it, it is only weakly supported.
Go, say I sent you to buy honor
And it was not the king who exiled you; or suppose
A devouring plague hangs in our air
And you fly to a cooler climate:
Look, what is dear to your soul, imagine it
To lie, that's where you're going, not where you're coming from:
Suppose songbirds are musicians,
The grass on which you walk the presence is strewn,
The beautiful flowers ladies, and your footsteps are no more
Than a delicious measure or a dance;
For knotty sorrow has less power to bite
The man who makes fun of it and brings it to light.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, who can hold a fire in his hand
Thinking of the icy Caucasus?
Or nauseate the hungry side of the appetite
By the simple imagination of a feast?
Or wallow naked in the December snow
Thinking about the fantastic heat of summer?
Oh no! the apprehension of good
Gives the feeling from greatest to worst:
The tooth of fallen sorrow never scratches again
Only when he bites, but does not sting the wound.

JEAN DE GANT:
Come, come, my son, I'll take you on your way:
If I had your youth and your cause, I wouldn't stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So, land of England, farewell; sweet earth, farewell;
My mother and my nanny still carry me!
Wherever I wander, I can boast,
Although banished, he is nevertheless a true born Englishman.

KING RICHARD II:
We have observed. Cousin Aumerle,
How far have you taken Hereford on its path?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I raised Hereford, if you call it that,
But until the next highway, and there I left it.

KING RICHARD II:
And say, what store of parting tears have been shed?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Well, nothing for me; except the northeast wind,
Which then blew bitterly in our faces,
I woke up the sleeping cold, and so by chance
Honored our hollow separation with a tear.

KING RICHARD II:
What did our cousin say when you separated from him?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
'Farewell:'
And, because my heart disdained that my tongue
Should he desecrate the word, it taught me the trade
To counterfeit the oppression of such sorrow
These words seemed buried in the grave of my sorrow.
Get married, would the word "farewell" have prolonged the hours
And he added years to his short banishment,
There should have been a volume of farewells;
But since that wasn't the case, he had nothing of me.

KING RICHARD II:
He's our cousin, cousin; but it's a doubt,
When time calls him back from banishment,
Let our relative come and see his friends.
Us and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
Observed his courtship of common people;
How he seemed to sink into their hearts
With humble and familiar courtesy,
What respect he cast on the slaves,
Wooing poor artisans with the art of smiling
And patiently bearing his fortune,
As if to banish their affects with him.
He goes with his hat to an oyster girl;
A pair of carters asked God to speed it up
And had the homage of his supple knee,
With “Thank you, my countrymen, my loving friends; »
As our England was in return to his,
And he gives the next level of hope to our subjects.

GREEN:
Well, he's gone; and with him go these thoughts.
Now let's move on to the rebels who stand out in Ireland,
Timely measures must be taken, my lord,
Before new hobbies give them other means
For their benefit and for the loss of Your Highness.

KING RICHARD II:
We will personally participate in this war:
And, for our coffers, with too big a yard
And liberal largesse becomes somewhat light,
We are obliged to cultivate our royal kingdom;
The income which will provide us
For our current affairs: if this fails,
Our replacements at home will have blank charters;
Therefore, when they know which men are rich,
They will subscribe them for large sums of gold
And then send them to provide for our needs;
Because we will soon be heading towards Ireland.
Bushy, what news?

BUSHY:
Old John of Gaunt is seriously ill, my lord,
Suddenly caught; and he sent the mail in haste
To beg your Majesty to visit him.

KING RICHARD II:
Where is he ?

BUSHY:
At Ely House.

KING RICHARD II:
Now put it, God, in the doctor's mind
To immediately help him go to his grave!
The lining of its chests will make coats
To equip our soldiers for these Irish wars.
Come, gentlemen, let's all visit him:
Let's pray that we can hurry and be too late!

All:
Amen.

JEAN DE GANT:
Will the king come so I can breathe my last
In salutary advice to his unpredictable youth?

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Do not torment yourself or struggle with your breath;
For advice comes to his ear in vain.

JEAN DE GANT:
O, but they speak the tongues of the dying
Strengthen attention like deep harmony:
Where words are scarce, they are rarely spent in vain,
For they breathe the truth who breathe their words with pain.
He who no longer has to say anything is listened to more
Only those to whom youth and ease have taught to close their eyes;
The ends of men are more marked than their previous lives:
The setting sun and the music at the end,
Like the last taste of candy, the sweetest is the last,
Write in remembrance more than things long past:
Although Richard will not hear my life's advice,
The sad story of my death could still deaf ears to him.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
No; he is stopped by other flattering sounds,
As praises that the wise are fond of,
Lascivious meters, whose venom resonates
The open ear of youth always listens;
Report on fashions in proud Italy,
Whose ways are still our late nation of apes
Box according to basic imitation.
Where does the world throw a conceit?
So it's new, there's no respect for how vile it is...
Didn't that quickly come to his attention?
Then, too late, advice arrives to be heard,
Where the gaze of the mind will revolt.
Do not direct the one who chooses the path he chooses:
It is a breath that you lack, and this breath you will lose.

JEAN DE GANT:
I think I'm a newly inspired prophet
And while exhaling like this, predict it:
His violent riot fire cannot last,
For violent fires soon extinguish themselves;
Small showers last a long time, but sudden storms are short;
He tires early, which stimulates too quickly from time to time;
With greedy feeding, food chokes the feeder:
Light vanity, insatiable cormorant,
To consume means, soon to attack itself.
This royal throne of kings, this scepter island,
This land of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, half-paradise,
This fortress built by Nature for itself
Against infection and the hand of war,
This happy race of men, this little world,
This precious stone set in the silver sea,
Who acts as a wall for him,
Or as a defensive ditch for a house,
Against the desire for less happy lands,
This blessed plot, this land, this kingdom, this England,
This nurse, this belly teeming with royal kings,
Feared by their race and famous by their birth,
Renowned for their exploits so far from home,
For Christian service and true chivalry,
Like the sepulcher of stubborn Jews,
From the ransom of the world, blessed Son of Mary,
This land of so dear souls, this dear land,
Dear for its reputation throughout the world,
Is now praised, I die pronouncing it,
As in a building or a skinning farm:
England, linked to the triumphant sea
Whose rocky shore repels the envious siege
From water Neptune, is now bound by shame,
With ink stains and rotten parchment ties:
This England, which was used to conquering others,
Made a shameful conquest of himself.
Ah, would the scandal disappear with my life,
How happy my death was then!

THE DUKE OF YORK:
The king has come: treat his youth gently;
For rabid hot young foals, rage even more.

QUEEN:
How is our noble uncle, Lancaster?

KING RICHARD II:
What comfort, man? How's it going with old Gaunt?

JEAN DE GANT:
Oh how this name suits my composition!
A gaunt old man indeed, and emaciated by his old age:
In me grief has maintained a tedious fast;
And who refrains from eating meat that is not lean?
For a long time I watched over sleeping England;
Looking breeds thinness, thinness is very thin:
The pleasure that some fathers feed on,
This is my strict fast; I mean, the appearance of my children;
And it was by fasting that you made me thin:
I am skinny for the grave, skinny as a grave,
Whose hollow stomach only inherits bones.

KING RICHARD II:
Can sick men play with their names so well?

JEAN DE GANT:
No, poverty makes sport laugh at itself:
Since you seek to kill my name in me,
I mock my name, great king, to flatter you.

KING RICHARD II:
Should the dying flatter those who are living?

JEAN DE GANT:
No, no, living men flatter those who are dying.

KING RICHARD II:
You, now dying, say that you flatter me.

JEAN DE GANT:
Oh no! you die, even if I am the sickest.

KING RICHARD II:
I am healthy, I breathe and I see you sick.

JEAN DE GANT:
Now he who created me knows that I see you sick;
I am sick of seeing in myself, and in you I see evil.
Your deathbed is nothing less than your land
This is why you lie with a sick reputation;
And you, too carefree patient that you are,
Entrust your anointed body to the remedy
Of these doctors who hurt you first:
A thousand flatterers sit in your crown,
Whose compass is no bigger than your head;
And yet, confined in such a small space,
Waste is not less than your land.
O, your grandfather had the eye of a prophet
I saw how his son's son must destroy his sons,
Out of your reach, he would have deposited your shame,
Deposing you before you are possessed,
What art now possessed of putting you down.
Why, cousin, were you regent of the world,
It was a shame to rent this land;
But so that your world only benefits from this earth,
Isn't it more than shameful to shame people like this?
You are now owner of England, not king:
Your rule of law is a slave to the law; And you--

KING RICHARD II:
A crazy, skinny fool,
Relying on the privilege of a league,
Dare with your cold warning
Make our cheeks pale, driving away the royal blood
With fury from his native residence.
Now, by the royal majesty of my seat,
Were you not the brother of the great Edward's son,
This language that runs so roundly in your head
Should take your head off your sassy shoulders.

JEAN DE GANT:
Oh, spare me not, son of my brother Edward,
For this I was his father Edward's son;
This blood already, like the pelican,
Did you bang and party drunk:
My brother Gloucester, pure and well-meaning soul,
Who is the best in heaven among happy souls!
Perhaps a precedent and a good witness
That you respect not to shed Edward's blood:
Join in the present illness I have;
And your wickedness be like a tortuous age,
Immediately harvest a flower that has faded for too long.
Live in your shame, but don't die in your shame!
These words will now be your executioners!
Lead me to my bed, then to my grave:
Love them to experience this love and honor.

KING RICHARD II:
And let them die of this age and sullenness;
For you have both, and both have become the grave.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
I beg your Majesty, impute his words
To the capricious illness and old age in him:
He loves you, in my life, and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of Hereford, was he here.

KING RICHARD II:
It is true, you speak the truth: as Hereford's love, so is his;
Like theirs, like mine; and everything be like that.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My liege, old Gaunt recommends it to your Majesty.

KING RICHARD II:
What's he saying ?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No nothing ; all is said
His tongue is now an instrument without strings;
Words, life and everything, old Lancaster spent them.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
So be York the next to go bankrupt!
Even if death is poor, it puts an end to mortal misfortune.

KING RICHARD II:
The ripest fruit falls first, and so does he;
His time is past, our pilgrimage must be.
So much for that. Now for our Irish Wars:
We must supplant these rough-headed kerns,
Who live like venom where there is no other venom
But only they have the privilege of living.
And for these big matters, ask for something,
Towards our help we grasp
The plate, the wheat, the income and the furniture,
Which our uncle Gaunt was in possession of.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
How long should I be patient? oh how long
Will tender duty make me suffer harm?
Neither the death of Gloucester, nor the banishment of Hereford
Neither Gaunt's reprimands, nor England's private wrongs,
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
Of his marriage, nor of my own shame,
Have already made my patient cheek sour,
Or fold a wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
I am the last of the noble Edward's sons,
Of which your father, Prince of Wales, was the first:
In times of war, never was a lion more ferocious,
In peace, never was a gentle lamb more gentle,
Than this young and princely gentleman.
You have his face, because he looked at him anyway,
Accomplished with the number of your hours;
But when he frowned, it was against the French
And not against his friends; his noble hand
He did what he spent and didn't spend that
That his father's triumphant hand had won;
His hands were not guilty of any kindred blood,
But bloody with the enemies of those close to him.
O Richard! York has gone too far in sorrow,
Or he would never make a comparison.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, uncle, what is it?

THE DUKE OF YORK:
O my lord,
Excuse me please ; otherwise, I'm happy
Not being forgiven, I'm happy with that.
I seek you to grasp and grasp in your hands
The royalties and rights of the banished Hereford?
Is not Gaunt dead, and is not Hereford alive?
Wasn't Gaunt right, and wasn't Harry right?
Didn't this one deserve to have an heir?
Isn't his heir a very deserving son?
Remove rights from Hereford and remove time
Its charters and customary rights;
Let tomorrow not follow today;
Don't be yourself; because how are you king
But by equitable sequence and succession?
Now, before God – God forbid that I speak the truth!
If you unjustly seize Hereford's rights,
Call the letters patent he has
By his attorneys general to prosecute
His livery, and denies the homage offered to him,
You put a thousand dangers on your head,
You lose a thousand willing hearts
And pricks my tender patience, at these thoughts
What honor and allegiance cannot think.

KING RICHARD II:
Think what you want, we take it in our hands
His plate, his goods, his money and his land.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
I will not be there for the moment: my liege, farewell:
What will result from this, no one can say;
But by bad course can be understood
That their events can never go well.

KING RICHARD II:
Go, Bushy, straight to the Earl of Wiltshire:
Offer to take us to Ely House
To see this case. Next tomorrow
We will do it for Ireland; and it's time, I say:
And we create, in the absence of ourselves,
Our Uncle York, Lord Governor of England;
Because he is just and has always loved us well.
Come, our queen: tomorrow we will have to separate;
Be cheerful, for our stay time is short

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well, my lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.

LORD ROSS:
And live too; for the moment his son is duke.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Barely in title, not in revenue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Rich in both cases, if justice was right.

LORD ROSS:
My heart is big; but we must break with the silence,
Don't let liberal language get you down.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, say what you think; and never let him speak any more
Who still speaks your words to harm you!

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Does he tend to talk to the Duke of Hereford?
If so, bring it out boldly, man;
My ear is quick to hear good things about him.

LORD ROSS:
I can't do anything good for him;
Unless you find it good to pity him,
Deprived and castrated of his heritage.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Now, before God, it is a shame that such wrongs should be borne
In him, a royal prince, and a lot of moe
Of noble blood in this declining country.
The king is not himself, but he is basely ruled
By flatterers; and what they will inform,
Simply out of hatred, against each of us,
That the king will pursue severely
“Against us, our lives, our children and our heirs.

LORD ROSS:
He plundered the communes with heavy taxes,
And they completely lost their hearts: the nobles were fined
For old quarrels, and they have completely lost their hearts.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And every day new abuses are imagined,
Like white people, benevolence, and I don’t know what:
But what in the name of God has become of this?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Wars have not wasted him, for he has not waged war,
But basely gave in to compromise
What his noble ancestors achieved with their fists:
He spent more on peace than they did on wars.

LORD ROSS:
The Earl of Wiltshire owns the kingdom as a farm.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
The king is bankrupt, like a broken man.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Reproach and dissolution weigh on him.

LORD ROSS:
He has no money for these Irish wars,
Despite its heavy taxes,
But by the flight of the banished duke.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
His noble relative: the most degenerate king!
But, lords, we hear this terrible storm singing,
Yet I see no shelter to avoid the storm;
We see the wind blowing on our sails,
And yet we do not strike, but safely perish.

LORD ROSS:
We see the very shipwreck that we must endure;
And the danger is now inevitable,
For having thus suffered from the causes of our shipwreck.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
This is not the case ; even through the hollow eyes of death
I spy on life by scrutinizing; but I don't dare say it
How near is the news of our comfort.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
No, let's share your thoughts, as you do ours.

LORD ROSS:
Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
The three of us are just you; and, speaking thus,
Your words are only thoughts; so be bold.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
So thus: I have Port le Blanc, a bay
In Brittany, information received
This Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
The latter separated from the Duke of Exeter,
His brother, the late Archbishop of Canterbury,
Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,
All this well provided by the Duke of Brittany
With eight large sailing ships, three thousand men of war,
Arrive here in complete convenience
And I would like to touch our northern coast soon:
Maybe they had it before, but they stay
The king's first departure for Ireland.
If then we can shake off our servile yoke,
Take out the broken wing of our falling country,
Redeem the stained crown from the pawnbroker,
Wipe away the dust that hides the gilding of our scepter
And make the high majesty look like itself,
Go with me to be stationed at Ravenspurgh;
But if you faint, for fear of doing so,
Stay and be secret, and I myself will leave.

LORD ROSS:
On horseback, on horseback! incite doubt to those who fear.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Tend my horse, and I will be there first.

BUSHY:
Madam, Your Majesty is too sad:
You promised, when you separated from the king,
To put aside the heaviness that harms life
And have a cheerful disposition.

QUEEN:
To please the king, I did it; just for me
I can not do it; yet I don't know any cause
Why should I welcome such a guest as sorrow,
Save saying goodbye to such a sweet guest
Like my sweet Richard: once again, I think,
An unborn sorrow, ripe in the bosom of fortune,
Comes to me and my inner soul
Without trembling at all: something is bothering him,
More than separating me from my lord the king.

BUSHY:
Every substance of a sorrow has twenty shadows,
Which sounds like grief itself, but it’s not;
For the eye of sorrow, glazed with blinding tears,
Divides a whole thing into several objects;
Like perspectives that rightly looked
Shows nothing but confusion, eyes turned wrong
Distinguish the form: thus your sweet majesty,
Looking askance at the departure of your lord,
Finding forms of sorrow, more than itself, to moan;
Which, seen as it is, is only shadows
Of what he is not. So, queen thrice gracious,
Weep no more than the departure of your lord: we see no more;
Or if it is, it is with a false eye of sorrow,
Who mourns imaginary things for true things.

QUEEN:
This may be the case; but yet my inner soul
Convinces me that it is otherwise: whatever it may be,
I can only be sad; so heavy and sad
Like, even though I don't think any thoughts, I think,
Makes me faint and shrink without anything heavy.

BUSHY:
It is only vanity, my gracious lady.

QUEEN:
It is nothing less: vanity is always derivative
From an ancestor's grief; mine is not,
For nothing had caused my sorrow;
Or something that doesn't bother me:
It is in reversion that I own;
But what it is is not yet known; What
I cannot name; It's an unspeakable misfortune, I know.

GREEN:
God save your majesty! and welcome, gentlemen:
I hope the king is not yet shipped to Ireland.

QUEEN:
Why do you hope so? it is better to hope that it is;
For his plans require haste, his haste is a good hope:
So why are you hoping it doesn't ship?

GREEN:
So that he, our hope, has withdrawn his power,
And drives an enemy's hope to despair,
Who has firmly established a foothold in this country:
The banished Bolingbroke revokes himself,
And with arms raised we arrived safe and sound
At Ravenspurgh.

QUEEN:
Now, God in heaven forbid!

GREEN:
Ah! Madam, it's too true: and it's worse,
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
The lords of Ross, Beaumond and Willoughby,
With all his powerful friends, they fled to him.

BUSHY:
Why didn't you proclaim Northumberland
And all the other rebellious faction traitors?

GREEN:
We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
Broke his staff, resigned his stewardship,
And all the servants fled with him
In Bolingbroke.

QUEEN:
So, Green, you are the midwife of my misfortune,
And Bolingbroke the sad heir of my pain:
Now my soul has given birth to its miracle,
And I, a panting newly-given mother,
Have misfortune with misfortune, sorrow with sorrow together.

BUSHY:
Do not despair, madam.

QUEEN:
Who will stop me?
I will despair and be at enmity
With a comforting hope: it is flattering,
A parasite, a guardian of death,
Who would gently dissolve the bonds of life,
What false hope persists in the extremity.

GREEN:
This is the Duke of York.

QUEEN:
With signs of war on his old neck:
Oh, her appearance is full of neat affairs!
Uncle, for God's sake, say comfortable words.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
If I do, I should disprove my thoughts:
Comfort is in heaven; and we are on earth,
Where nothing lives but crosses, worries and sorrow.
Your husband, he went to save far away,
While others come to destroy him at home:
Here I am left to support his land,
Who, weakened by age, cannot meet his needs:
Now comes the hour of illness caused by his excess;
Now he will try his friends who flattered him.

Servant:
My lord, your son left before my arrival.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
It was? Well then! go in all directions!
The nobles are on the run, the towns are cold,
And I fear he will revolt alongside Hereford.
Sirrah, take you to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;
Tell him to send me a thousand pounds at once:
Wait, take my ring.

Servant:
My lord, I forgot to tell your lordship,
Today, in passing, I passed there;
But I will pain you to bring back the rest.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
What is it, rascal?

Servant:
An hour before my arrival, the duchess died.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
God for his mercy! what a tide of misfortunes
Come immediately to this sad country!
I don't know what to do: I wish it to God,
So my lie didn't make him do it,
The king had cut off my head along with that of my brother.
What, there's no mail sent to Ireland?
How are we going to find money for these wars?
Come on, my sister, cousin, I said, please forgive me.
Go, buddy, go home, give carts.
And take the armor that is there.
Gentlemen, are you going to gather men?
If I know how or in what manner to order these affairs
Thus thrown the mess into my hands,
Never believe me. Both are my parents:
One is my sovereign, to whom my oath
And duty offers defend; the other again
Is my kinsman, whom the king has wronged,
To whom conscience and those close to me want to straighten out.
Well, we have to do something. Come, cousin, I'm going
Get rid of yourself.
Gentlemen, go, gather your men,
And find me currently in Berkeley.
I should also go to Plashy;
But time does not allow it: everything is uneven,
And everything is left at six and seven o'clock.

BUSHY:
The wind is good for the news to reach Ireland,
But none comes back. For us to raise power
Proportionate to the enemy
All this is impossible.

GREEN:
Besides, our proximity to the king in love
Is close to the hatred of those who do not love the king.

BAGOT:
And it is the faltering common good: for their love
Lies in their purse, and whoever empties them
It fills their hearts with deadly hatred.

BUSHY:
In which the king is generally condemned.

BAGOT:
If the judgment rests on them, then so do we,
Because we have always been close to the king.

GREEN:
Well, I will take refuge directly at Bristol Castle:
The Earl of Wiltshire is already here.

BUSHY:
I will go there with you; for small office
The hateful commons will play for us,
Except like dogs tearing us all to pieces.
Do you want to come with us?

BAGOT:
No; I will go to Ireland to see his majesty.
Farewell: if the omens of the heart are not in vain,
The three of us are here and we will never see each other again.

BUSHY:
It was then that York attempted to repel Bolingbroke.

GREEN:
Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
Is counting the sands and drinking the oceans dry:
Where one side fights, thousands will flee.
Goodbye now, for once, for all and forever.

BUSHY:
Well, we might meet again.

BAGOT:
I fear myself, never.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How far is it now to Berkeley, my lord?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Believe me, noble lord,
I'm a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
These high wild hills and these rough and uneven paths
It lengthens our miles and makes them boring,
And yet your beautiful speech was like sugar,
Making the difficult path sweet and delicious.
But I remember in what a weary way
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will lie
To Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
Which, I protest, was very attractive
The arduousness and progress of my trip:
But theirs is softened by the hope of having
The current profit that I have;
And hope in joy is a little less in joy
That hope enjoyed: by this the weary lords
Their path will seem short, as mine did
In view of what I have, your noble company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My business is worth much less
Only your good words. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
This is my son, young Harry Percy,
Sent by my brother Worcester, wherever that is.
Harry, how is your uncle?

HENRY PERCY:
I thought, my lord, that I had learned of his state of health from you.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Why isn't he with the queen?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good God; he abandoned the court,
Broke his office stick and scattered
The king's house.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What was his reason?
He wasn't as resolute the last time we spoke together.

HENRY PERCY:
Because Your Lordship has been proclaimed a traitor.
But he, my lord, has gone to Ravenspurgh,
To offer his services to the Duke of Hereford,
And sent me to Berkeley to find out
What power the Duke of York had raised there;
Then with instructions for repairing at Ravenspurgh.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Have you forgotten the Duke of Hereford, my boy?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good lord, because this cannot be forgotten
Which I never remembered: to my knowledge,
I've never watched it in my life.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
So get to know him now; it's the duke.

HENRY PERCY:
My gracious lord, I offer you my service,
As it is, being tender, raw and young:
Which ancient days will ripen and confirm
Towards a more approved service and desert.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thank you, sweet Percy; and be sure
I don't count myself in anything else so happy
As in a soul remembering my good friends;
And, as my fortune matures with your love,
This will always be the reward of your true love:
My heart makes this alliance, my hand thus seals it.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
How far is Berkeley? and what agitation
He keeps good old York there with his men of war?

HENRY PERCY:
There stands the castle, near this clump of trees,
Equipped with three hundred men, as I have heard it said;
And within are the lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
No other of name and noble esteem.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here are the lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Bloody with impulse, fiery red with haste.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Welcome, my lords. I know your love continues
A banished traitor: all my treasure
It is still only an unfelt thank you, which is even more enriched
Will be the reward for your love and your work.

LORD ROSS:
Your presence makes us rich and very noble lord.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And far surpasses our work to achieve it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thank you always, treasurer of the poor;
And until my childish fortune reaches years,
Represents my bounty. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
This is my lord of Berkeley, as I suppose.

LORD BERKELEY:
Monsignor of Hereford, my message is addressed to you.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My Lord, my answer is: in Lancaster;
And I came to look for this name in England;
And I have to find this title in your language,
Before responding to everything you say.

LORD BERKELEY:
Make no mistake, my lord; that's not my meaning
To shave a title of your honor:
To you, my lord, I come, which lord you want,
From the most gracious regent of this country,
The Duke of York, to find out what's bothering you
To take advantage of the time away
And frighten our native peace with self-born weapons.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I will not need to transport my words through you;
Here is his grace in person. My noble uncle!

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Show me your humble heart, not your knee,
Whose duty is deceptive and false.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious uncle...

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Tut tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle-me no uncle:
I am not the uncle of a traitor; and this word “grace”.
In an unsightly mouth, it is only profane.
Why are these legs banned and forbidden?
Have you dared to touch a piece of dust from English soil?
But then no more “why?” » why did they dare to walk
So many kilometers on its peaceful breast,
Scaring its pale-faced villages with war
And the ostentation of despised weapons?
Are you coming because the anointed king is from here?
Well, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
And in my faithful bosom lies his power.
Was I but now the lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt, your father and I
Saved the Black Prince, this young Mars of men,
Ranks of several thousand French people,
Oh, so how fast should my arm do it.
Now a prisoner of paralysis, punish yourself
And correct your mistake!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious uncle, make me know my fault:
What condition is it in and where?

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Even in the worst conditions,
In gross rebellion and hated betrayal:
You are a banished man, and here you have come
Before your time expires,
By braving arms against your sovereign.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As I was banished, I was banished Hereford;
But when I come, I come for Lancaster.
And, noble uncle, I implore your mercy
Look at my wrongs with indifferent eyes:
You are my father, because I think in you
I see old Gaunt alive; O then, my father,
Do you allow me to be condemned
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
Torn from my arms by force and given
For upstarts who are not thrifty? Why was I born?
If my cousin is king of England,
It must be admitted that I am Duke of Lancaster.
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
If thou hadst died the first time, and thus been trodden under foot,
He should have found a father for his uncle Gaunt,
To awaken his wrongs and chase them back to the bay.
I am refused to continue my livery here,
And yet my letters patent give me leave:
My father's possessions are all seized and sold,
And all this and all this is misused.
What would you like me to do? I am a subject,
And I challenge the law: they refuse me lawyers;
And so, personally, I claim
To my inheritance of free descent.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke has been too badly treated.

LORD ROSS:
Your grace is to do him good.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Vile men, through its endowments, become great.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
My Lords of England, let me say this to you:
I felt my cousin's wrongs
And I worked all I could to do him good;
But in this kind to come, in brave arms,
Be his own sculptor and trace his path,
To discover good and evil, this may not be the case;
And you who encourage him in this way
Let us cherish rebellion and be all rebels.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke swore that his coming was
But for his own; and for this right
We all swore strongly to help him;
And may he never see the joy that breaks this oath!

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Well, I see the issue with these weapons:
I can't fix it, I must confess,
Because my power is weak and everyone is sick:
But if I could, through Him who gave me life,
I'll tie you all up and bring you down
To the sovereign mercy of the king;
But since I can't, just know
I remain neutral. Then good luck ;
Unless you like to enter the castle
And then, rest for the night.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
But we must earn your grace to come with us
At Bristol Castle, said to be held
By Bushy, Bagot and their accomplices,
The Commonwealth caterpillars,
That I swore to weed and pull.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
It may be that I will go with you: but yet I will stop;
Because I am loath to break the laws of our country.
Neither friends nor enemies, for me, you are welcome:
Things that cannot be repaired are now inconceivable to me.

Captain:
Monsignor of Salisbury, we stayed ten days,
And barely kept our compatriots together,
And yet we have no news from the king;
So we are going to disperse: goodbye.

COUNTY OF SALISBURY:
Stay one more day, faithful Welshman:
The king places all his trust in you.

Captain:
It is believed that the king is dead; we will not stay.
The laurels of our country are all withered
And the meteors frighten the fixed stars of the sky;
The pale-faced moon appears bloodied on the earth
And the thin-looking prophets whisper fearful changes;
The rich men look sad and the thugs dance and jump,
He who is afraid of losing what he enjoys,
The other to enjoy through rage and war:
These signs announce the death or fall of kings.
Farewell: our compatriots have left and fled,
Might as well assure Richard that their king is dead.

COUNTY OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, with the eyes of a heavy spirit
I see your glory like a shooting star
Fall from the firmament to the lower earth.
Your sun sets weeping in the humble west,
To witness the coming storms, misfortune and troubles:
Your friends have fled to serve your enemies,
And all fortune goes to your good.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Get these men out.
Bushy and Green, I won't offend your souls...
Since currently your souls must separate your bodies...
By pressing too hard on your pernicious lives,
For there was no charity; yet, to wash your blood
From my hands, here, in the eyes of men
I will reveal some of the causes of your death.
You deceived a prince, a royal king,
A happy gentleman in blood and features,
By you, unhappy and disfigured, clean:
You are in tune with your hours of sin
He divorced his queen and himself,
Broke the possession of a royal bed
And stained the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
With tears drawn from his eyes by your horrible wrongs.
Myself, prince of fortune from my birth,
Close to the king by blood and close by love
Until you make him misinterpret me,
I bowed my neck under your wounds,
And sighed my English breath in the foreign clouds,
Eat the bitter bread of banishment;
While you were feeding off my signatories,
I destroyed my parks and cut down my forests,
From my own windows I tore off my housecoat,
I shaved off my footprint, leaving me no sign,
Save the opinions of men and my living blood,
To show the world that I'm a gentleman.
This and much more, much more than double all of this,
Sentences you to death. See them delivered
To execution and the hand of death.

BUSHY:
The death blow is more welcome for me
Than Bolingbroke in England. Lords, farewell.

GREEN:
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
And torment injustice with the pains of hell.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My Lord Northumberland, have them sent away.
Uncle, you say that the queen is at your house;
For the love of God, let her be honestly begged:
Tell him that I send him my kind congratulations;
Take particular care that my greetings are delivered.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
One of my gentlemen that I sent
With letters of your love for her in general.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thank you, kind uncle. Come, lords, go.
To fight Glendower and his accomplices:
A time to work and after vacation.

KING RICHARD II:
Is Barkloughly Castle called that?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yes my Lord. How your grace supports the air,
After your lateness on the breaking sea?

KING RICHARD II:
I have to like him: I cry with joy
To stand on my kingdom again.
Dear earth, I greet you with my hand,
Even if the rebels hurt you with the hooves of their horses:
As a long-separated mother with her child
Tenderly plays with her tears and smiles in meetings,
So, crying and smiling, I salute you, my land,
And do you a favor with my royal hands.
Do not feed the enemy of your sovereign, my sweet land,
Nor with your sweetness comfort his voracious sense;
But let your spiders, which suck your venom,
And heavy-stepping toads stand in their way,
Annoying treacherous feet
Who tramples you with usurping steps:
Give nettles to my enemies;
And when they pluck a flower from your bosom,
Keep it, please, with a hidden viper
Whose double tongue can with mortal touch
Cast death on the enemies of your sovereign.
Do not mock my foolish conspiracy, lords:
This land will have a feeling and these stones
Prove armed soldiers, before his native king
Must weaken under the weapons of filthy rebellion.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Do not fear, my lord: this power which made you king
Has the power to keep you king despite everything.
The means that heaven gives must be adopted,
And not neglected; otherwise, if heaven wanted it,
And we won't, we refuse heaven's offer,
The means of relief and repair offered.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
He means, my lord, that we are too careless;
While Bolingbroke, thanks to our security,
Becomes strong and great in substance and power.

KING RICHARD II:
Uncomfortable cousin! you do not know
That when the searching eye of heaven is hidden,
Behind the globe which illuminates the lower world,
Then thieves and thieves spread abroad unseen
In murders and outrages, here boldly;
But when under this earth ball
It fires on the proud tops of the eastern pines
And shines its light through all the guilty holes,
Then murders, betrayals and hated sins,
The cloak of night being torn from their backs,
Standing naked and naked, trembling on their own?
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
Who all this time has been enjoying the night
While we wandered to the antipodes,
Will see us rise on our throne, in the east,
His betrayals will blush in his face,
Unable to bear the sight of day,
But he trembles in fear before his sin.
Not all the water in the choppy, choppy sea
Can wash away the balm of an anointed king;
The breath of the men of the world cannot drop
The deputy elected by the Lord:
For every man Bolingbroke pressed
To raise shrewd steel against our golden crown,
God for his Richard has a heavenly reward
A glorious angel: then, if the angels fight,
Weak men must fall, for heaven always preserves the good.
Welcome, my lord, how far is your power?

COUNTY OF SALISBURY:
Neither near nor further, my gracious lord,
May this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
And orders me to speak only of despair.
One day too late, I fear, noble lord,
Has darkened all your happy days on earth:
O, remember yesterday, return from auction time,
And you will have twelve thousand fighters!
Today, today, unfortunate day, too late,
O'ermet your joys, your friends, your fortune and your state:
For all the Welsh, hearing that you were dead.
Went to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my lord; why does your Grace look so pale?

KING RICHARD II:
But now the blood of twenty thousand men
They triumphed before me, and fled;
And, until so much blood returns,
Don't I have a reason to look pale and dead?
All the souls that will be safe fly to my side,
Because time has tarnished my pride.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my lord; remember who you are.

KING RICHARD II:
I had forgotten myself; I'm not a king?
Wake up, cowardly majesty! you sleep.
Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
To your great glory. Don't look at the ground,
You, favorites of a king: are we not high?
High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
Has enough power to serve our tower. But who comes here?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
More health and happiness for my lord
That my well-regulated tongue cannot deliver him!

KING RICHARD II:
My ear is open and my heart prepared;
The worst is the material loss you can cause.
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, that was my concern
And what loss does it represent to get rid of care?
Is Bolingbroke striving to be as big as us?
It will not be bigger; if he serves God,
We will also serve Him and be like Him thus:
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot repair;
They break their faith in God as well as in us:
Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decadence:
The worst is death, and death will have its day.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
I am glad that Your Highness is so armed
To bear the news of a calamity.
Like an unseasonably stormy day,
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
As if the world was dissolved to the point of tears,
So far above its limits, the rage swells
From Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
With hard, shiny steel and hearts harder than steel.
White beards have armed their thin, hairless scalps
Against your majesty; boys, with women's voices,
Strive to speak big and clap their feminine joints
In arms stiff and cumbersome against your crown:
The same pearlers learn to bend their bows
Of a deadly double yew against your state;
Yeah, the distaffs handle the rusty bills
Against your seat: young and old rebels,
And everything is worse than I can say.

KING RICHARD II:
Too good, too good you tell such a bad story.
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?
What happened to Bushy? where is green?
That they left the dangerous enemy
Measure our limits with such peaceful steps?
If we win, their leaders will pay the price:
I guarantee they made peace with Bolingbroke.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
They have truly made peace with him, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
O villains, vipers, damned without redemption!
Dogs, easy to win over to adore any man!
Snakes, in my heart warmed by blood, stinging my heart!
Three Judases, each three times worse than Judas!
Would they make peace? a terrible hell, to make war
On their souls stained for this offense!

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Sweet love, I see, changing ownership,
Turns to the bitterest and deadliest hatred:
Curse their souls again; their peace is made
With heads, not hands; those you curse
I felt the worst destructive wound of death
And rest low, etched in the hollow ground.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Are Bushy, Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Yes, in Bristol, everyone has lost their minds.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the Duke my father with his power?

KING RICHARD II:
No matter where; of comfort, no man speaks:
Let's talk about tombs, verses and epitaphs;
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
Let's choose executors and talk about wills:
And yet this is not the case, because what can we bequeath
Save our bodies lying on the ground?
Our lands, our lives and everything belong to Bolingbroke,
And nothing can belong to us except death
And this little model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and covering for our bones.
For God's sake let's sit on the floor
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
How some were deposited; some killed in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they left behind;
Some poisoned by their wives: some asleep killed;
All murdered: because in the hollow crown
Who surrounds the mortal temples of a king
He keeps death in his court and that's where the tomfoolery is,
Mocking his state and smiling at his pomp,
Allowing him to breathe, a little scene,
To monarchize, fear and kill with looks,
Infusing it with self and vain vanity,
As if this flesh which walls up our life,
Were the brass impregnable and were they thus humored
Comes last and with a small pin
Break through the walls of his castle, and farewell king!
Cover your head and do not mock flesh and blood
With solemn respect: cast respect,
Tradition, form and ceremonial duty,
Because all this time you've been wrong about me:
I live with bread like you, I want,
Taste sorrow, need friends: submissive thus,
How can you tell me, I'm a king?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
My lord, wise men never sit and bemoan their misfortunes,
But for now, avoid the ways of whining.
Fear the enemy, since fear oppresses strength,
Give strength to your enemy in your weakness,
And so your follies fight against yourself.
Fear and be killed; nothing worse can happen in combat:
And to fight and to die, it is death that destroys death;
Where the fear of dying pays for the servile breath of death.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My father has a power; ask about him
And learn how to make a body from one limb.

KING RICHARD II:
You reprimand me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
To change things with you for our day of misfortune.
This attack of fear is exaggerated;
An easy task is to earn ours.
Say, Scroop, where is our uncle with his power?
Speak softly, man, even if your air is sour.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Men judge by the color of the sky
The state and inclination of the day:
So may you, through my dull and heavy eye,
My tongue only has a heavier story to tell.
I play the executioner, little by little
To prolong the worst that must be said:
Your uncle York is joined by Bolingbroke,
And all your northern castles have given way,
And all your southern gentlemen-at-arms
At his party.

KING RICHARD II:
You've said enough.
Here you are, cousin, what led me
In this sweet way, I was in despair!
What do you say now? what comfort do we have now?
By heaven, I will hate him forever
This requires me to comfort myself further.
Go to Flint Castle: there I will waste away;
A king, slave of misfortune, must obey royal misfortune.
This power that I have, discharge it; and let them go
To spy on the earth which has a hope of growth,
Because I don't have one: let no one speak anymore
To change this, because the advice is only in vain.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My lord, a word.

KING RICHARD II:
It hurts me doubly
It hurts me by the flattery of his tongue.
Unload my supporters: let them go,
From Richard's Night to Bolingbroke Fair Day.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So that through this intelligence we learn
The Welsh are scattered and Salisbury
Went to meet the king, who recently landed
With some private friends on this coast.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The news is very fair and good, my lord:
Richard, not far from here, hid his head.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
It would suit Lord Northumberland
To say "King Richard:" alas, it's a difficult day
When such a sacred king should hide his head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Your errors of grace; just to be brief
I left out its title.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
The time has come,
Would you have been so brief with him, he
I was so brief with you, to make it shorter,
To take the head in this way, along the entire length of your head.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Make no mistake, uncle, further than you should.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Do not go, good cousin, further than you should.
Make no mistake, the heavens are above our heads.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I know it, uncle, and I do not object
Against their will. But who comes here?
Welcome, Harry: what, won't this castle give in?

HENRY PERCY:
The castle is royally inhabited, my lord,
Against your entrance.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Royally!
Why does it not contain a king?

HENRY PERCY:
Yes, my good lord,
It contains a king; King Richard lies
Within the limits of this lime and this stone:
And with him are Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence; which, I cannot learn.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Oh, it seems to be the Bishop of Carlisle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Noble lords,
Go to the rough shores of this ancient castle;
Through the brass trumpet send the breath of talks
Into his ruined ears, and thus delivers:
Henry Bolingbroke
On his knees, he kisses King Richard's hand
And send allegiance and true faith of heart
To his most regal person, come here
Even at his feet to lay down my weapons and my power,
Provided my ban is repealed
And the returned lands are again granted free of charge:
Otherwise I will use the advantage of my power
And lays down the summer dust with rains of blood
It was raining wounds from the massacred English:
The what, how far from Bolingbroke's mind
That's right, such a crimson storm should soak
The new green lap of King Richard's fair land,
My leaning duty will show it with tenderness.
Come on, mean it as much, while here we walk
On the grassy carpet of this plain.
Let us walk without the sound of threatening drums,
It comes from the tattered battlements of this castle
Our fair appointments can be well consulted.
I think King Richard and I should meet
With no less terror than the elements
Fire and water, when their thunderous clash
At the meeting, the cloudy cheeks of the sky are torn.
Let him be the fire, I will be the water that gives:
Rage be his, while on earth I rain
My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
Continue walking and observe what King Richard looks like.
See, see, King Richard himself appears,
Just like the blushing and discontented sun
From the fiery portal of the east,
When he notices that the envious clouds are bending
To dull its glory and stain the trail
Of his brilliant passage in the West.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Yet he is like a king: behold, his eye,
As bright as that of the eagle, it lights up
Controlling majesty: alas, alas, woe,
How much evil should stain such a beautiful spectacle!

KING RICHARD II:
We are surprised; and we stood for so long
To watch the terrible bending of your knee,
Because we considered ourselves your rightful king:
And if so, how dare your joints forget
To fulfill their terrible duty to our presence?
If we are not, show us the hand of God
This dismissed us from our stewardship;
Because we know it well, no hand of blood and bone
Can grasp the sacred handle of our scepter,
Unless he desecrates, steals or usurps.
And even if you think that everything, as you did,
Tore away their souls by turning them away from us,
And we are barren and deprived of friends;
But know, my master, Almighty God,
Gathers in its clouds in our name
Armies of plague; and they will strike
Your children yet unborn and unbegotten,
Who raises your vassal hands against my head
And threatens the glory of my precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke, for it seems to me he is standing there.
That every step he takes on my land
It's a dangerous betrayal: he came to open
The Purple Testament of Bloody War;
But before the crown he seeks lives in peace,
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
Will ill become the flower of England's face,
Change the complexion of his pale peace
To scarlet indignation and dew
The grass of his pastures with faithful English blood.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The king of heaven forbids our lord the king
Should it be like this with civilian and uncivil weapons
Be in a hurry! Your thrice noble cousin
Harry Bolingbroke humbly kisses your hand;
And by the honorable tomb he swears,
Which rests on the bones of your royal grandfather,
And by the royalties of your two bloods,
Currents that flow from a most graceful head,
And by the buried hand of warrior Gaunt,
And by his valor and his honor,
Comprising everything that can be sworn or said,
His coming here no longer has any significance
That for its linear royalties and to beg
Immediate postage on your knees:
What your royal party once granted,
He will rust his glittering arms,
His barbed horses in the stables and his heart
In faithful service to Your Majesty.
He swears that as a prince, he is just;
And as I am a gentleman, I do him honor.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, say thus that the king returns:
His noble cousin is welcome here;
And all the number of his just demands
Must be accomplished without contradiction:
With all the gracious words you have
Speak to his sweet hearing and give praise.
We degrade ourselves, cousin, don't we,
Look so bad and speak so right?
Shall we call back Northumberland and send
Defy the traitor, and thus die?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
No, good monsignor; let's fight with sweet words
In the meantime, lend your friends and friends their useful swords.

KING RICHARD II:
O God, oh God! that it is still my language,
This pronounced the sentence of dreadful banishment
On your proud man you should take it off again
With soothing words! Oh that I was so big
Like my sorrow, or less than my name!
Or that I could forget what I was,
Or don't remember what I should be now!
Are you swollen, proud heart? I will give you the chance to fight,
Since enemies have the ability to beat you and me.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Northumberland returns from Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
What should the king do now? should he submit?
The king will do it: must he be deposed?
The king will be happy: must he lose
The name of the king? O name of God, let it go:
I will give my jewels for a set of pearls,
My magnificent palace for a hermitage,
My gay clothing for a chaplain's robe,
My cups figured for a wooden dish,
My scepter for walking stick from a palm tree,
My subjects for a pair of sculpted saints
And my great kingdom for a small grave,
A small little grave, a dark grave;
Or I will be buried on the king's road,
A common trade route, where the feet of the subjects
Can trample on the head of their sovereign every hour;
For they tread upon my heart now while I live;
And buried once, why not on my head?
Aumerle, you are crying, my tender cousin!
We will make bad weather with despised tears;
Our sighs and they will lay down the summer corn,
And make a famine in this revolting country.
Or will we play wanton with our misfortunes,
And have a nice match while shedding tears?
So, to place them again in the same place,
Until they bore us with a pair of graves
In the ground ; and, in there, that's where we find
Two parents dug their graves with crying eyes.
Wouldn't that feel good? Well I see
I speak but without saying anything, and you make fun of me.
Most powerful prince, my Lord Northumberland,
What does King Bolingbroke say? does his majesty
Give Richard permission to live until he dies?
You do a leg, and Bolingbroke says yes.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Monsignor, he attends the basic court
To talk with you ; please come down.

KING RICHARD II:
Down below, I go down; like the brilliant Phaethon,
Wanting to deal with unruly jades.
At the basic court? Base court, where kings cultivate their base,
Answer the calls of traitors and grant them mercy.
At the basic court? To come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For the night owls cry where the larks soar
should sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What does his majesty say?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Grief and heartbreak
Makes him speak with tenderness, like a frenzied man
Yet he came.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Everyone stay away,
And show just duty to his majesty.
My gracious lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
Beautiful cousin, you degrade your princely knee
To make the base land proud to embrace it:
I wish my heart felt your love
Let my displeased eye see your courtesy.
Stand up, cousin, stand up; your heart is on high, I know,
So high at least, although your knee is low.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious lord, I come but for mine.

KING RICHARD II:
Yours is yours, and I'm yours, and all.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Until now be mine, my most formidable lord,
How my true service will merit your love.

KING RICHARD II:
Well, you deserve it: they deserve to have it,
Who know the strongest and safest way to achieve this.
My uncle, give me your hands; no, dry your eyes;
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
Cousin, I'm too young to be your father,
Even if you are old enough to be my heir.
What you have I will give, and I will also do it;
For we must do what force will make us do.
Go to London, cousin, won't you?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yes, my good lord.

KING RICHARD II:
So I don't have to say no.

QUEEN:
What sport are we going to imagine here in this garden,
To chase away the heavy thought of worry?

Lady:
Madam, we will play bowls.

QUEEN:
"It will make me think that the world is full of friction,
And let my fortune rub shoulders with bias.

Lady:
Madam, we are going to dance.

QUEEN:
My legs cannot keep any measure of pleasure,
When my poor heart cannot bear any measure in sorrow:
Therefore, no dancing, my daughter; another sport.

Lady:
Madam, we will tell stories.

QUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?

Lady:
One or the other, ma'am.

QUEEN:
Neither, my daughter:
Because of joy, totally lacking in joy,
This reminds me of all the more sorrow;
Or if, with grief, being thoroughly tried,
This adds even more sorrow to my lack of joy:
For what I have, I need not repeat it;
And what I want are the boots so I don't complain.

Lady:
Madam, I'm going to sing.

QUEEN:
It's good that you have a reason
But you should please me more, do you want to cry.

Lady:
I could cry, madam, it would do you good.

QUEEN:
And I could sing, would crying do me any good,
And never borrow a single tear from you.
But stay, here are the gardeners:
Let's enter the shade of these trees.
My misery has a row of pins,
They will talk about the State; because everyone does it
Against a change; misfortune is preceded by misfortune.

Gardener:
Go, tie up your dangling abricocks,
Who, like unruly children, make their father
Stoop with the oppression of their prodigal weight:
Give the bent twigs some support.
Go, and like an executioner,
Cut off the heads of sheaves that grow too quickly,
This seems too high in our Commonwealth:
Everything must be equal in our government.
You are thus employed, I will leave
Noxious weeds that suck without profit
Soil fertility through healthy flowers.

Servant:
Why should we in the compass of a pale
Keep the law, the form and the proportion,
Showing, as in a model, our farm domain,
When our garden bordered by the sea, all the earth,
Is full of weeds, its most beautiful flowers smothered,
Its fruit trees overturned, its hedges destroyed,
Its messy knots and healthy herbs
A swarm of caterpillars?

Gardener:
Shut up :
The one who suffered from this disorderly spring
Now he himself encountered falling leaves:
The weeds that its broad leaves sheltered,
It seemed to eat him to hold him back,
Roots and all are pulled out by Bolingbroke,
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.

Servant:
What, are they dead?

Gardener:
They are; and Bolingbroke
Seized the waster king. O, what a pity is it
That he had not pruned and dressed his land so well
Like us this garden! Us at the time of year
Wound the bark, the skin of our fruit trees,
Lest, too proud of sap and blood,
With too much wealth he gets confused:
If he had done this to tall and growing men,
They could have lived to endure and he to taste
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
We prune so that the branches that carry:
If he had done so, he would have worn the crown himself,
What a waste of idle hours has completely destroyed.

Servant:
What, do you think the king will be deposed then?

Gardener:
Depressed, he is already and deposited
I doubt it is: the letters arrived last night
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York,
This heralds dark news.

QUEEN:
Oh, I'm in a hurry to death for want of words!
You, likeness of old Adam, ready to dress this garden,
How dare your harsh and coarse tongue announce this unpleasant news?
What Eve, what snake suggested to you
Make a second fall of the cursed man?
Why do you say that King Richard is deposed?
Would you dare, little thing better than the earth,
Can you guess his fall? Say where, when and how,
Did you hear this bad news? speak, wretch.

Gardener:
Forgive me, madam: I have little joy
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
King Richard, he's in the mighty hold
From Bolingbroke: Their fortunes are both weighed:
In your lord's ladder there is nothing but himself,
And some vanities which make it light;
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
Besides him, all the English peers are
And with these odds he weighs down King Richard.
Send yourself to London, and you will find it so;
I don't talk any more than everyone knows.

QUEEN:
Agile misfortune, who is so light on your feet,
Doesn't your embassy belong to me,
And am I the last to know? O, you think
To serve me last, so I can keep the longest
Your pain in my chest. Come, ladies, go,
To meet the ill-fated King of London in London.
What, was I born for this, that my sad look
Should we honor the triumph of the great Bolingbroke?
Gardener, for telling me this unfortunate news,
Pray to God that the plants you graft never grow.

GARDENER:
Poor queen! so that your condition is not worse,
I would like my skills to be subject to your curse.
Here she shed a tear; here at this place
I will put a street bank, sour grass of grace:
Rue, even for Ruth, will soon be seen here,
In memory of a crying queen.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Call Bagot.
Now, Bagot, express freely what you think;
What you know of the death of noble Gloucester,
Who did it with the king and who executed him
The bloody office of its timeless end.

BAGOT:
Then place Lord Aumerle before me.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Cousin, get up and look at this man.

BAGOT:
Monsignor Aumerle, I know your bold language
He scorns to deny what he has delivered once he has delivered it.
In that dead age when Gloucester's death was planned,
I heard you say: "Isn't my arm long,
It comes from the peaceful English court
To Calais, to my uncle's head?
Among so many other discussions, at that moment,
I heard you say that you preferred to refuse
The offer of one hundred thousand crowns
Than the return of Bolingbroke to England;
Adding how blessed this land would be
It's the death of your cousin.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Princes and noble lords,
What response should I make to this vile man?
Should I so dishonor my beautiful stars,
On an equal footing to give him punishment?
Either I have to do it or I have to sully my honor.
With the reaching of his slanderous lips.
There is my gauge, the manual seal of death,
This marks you for hell: I say, you lie,
And I will argue that what you said is wrong
In your heart's blood, even if you're too low
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bagot, abstain; you won't take it.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Except one, I wish he was the best
In all this presence which moved me so much.

LORD FITZWATER:
If your value lies in sympathy,
Here is my pledge, Aumerle, in pledge with yours:
By this beautiful sun which shows me where you are,
I heard you say, and you said it with boasting
That you are the cause of the death of noble Gloucester.
If you deny it twenty times, you lie;
And I will turn your lie to your heart,
Where it was forged, with the tip of my rapier.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
You dare not, coward, live to see that day.

LORD FITZWATER:
Now, by my soul, I would like it at this hour.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Fitzwater, you are damned to hell for this.

HENRY PERCY:
Aumerle, you are lying; his honor is also true
In this appeal, how unjust you are;
And you are, there I throw my pledge,
To prove it to you to the most extreme point
Of deadly breath: seize it, if you dare.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
And if I don't, may my hands rot
And never wield more vengeful steel
On the glittering helmet of my enemy!

Lord:
I entrust the land to the same, Aumerle perjure;
And encourage you with so many lies
How hollow can be in your treacherous ear
From sun to sun: here is the pawn of my honor;
Engage him in the test, if you dare.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Who else defines me? by heaven, I will throw away at all:
I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
To respond to twenty thousand like you.

DUKE OF SURREY:
Monsignor Fitzwater, I remember well
The very time you and Aumerle spoke.

LORD FITZWATER:
It is very true: you were then in the presence;
And you can testify with me that it's true.

DUKE OF SURREY:
As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.

LORD FITZWATER:
Surrey, you're lying.

DUKE OF SURREY:
Dishonorable boy!
This lie will lie so heavy on my sword,
That he will repay vengeance and revenge
Until you're the one who gives the lie and that lie lies
On a land as calm as your father's skull:
As proof, here is the pawn of my honor;
Engage him in the test, if you dare.

LORD FITZWATER:
With what tenderness you encourage a horse forward!
If I dare to eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
I dare to meet Surrey in a desert,
And spit on him, while I say he lies,
And lies, and lies: this is my bond of faith,
To bind you to my strong correction.
As I intend to flourish in this new world,
Aumerle is guilty of my real call:
Besides, I heard banished Norfolk say
That you, Aumerle, sent two of your men
Execute the noble duke at Calais.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
An honest Christian entrusts me with a gauge
Let Norfolk lie: here I throw this,
If he can be revoked, to judge his honor.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
These differences must all remain under gauge
Until Norfolk is repealed: it shall be repealed,
And, although my enemy, restored again
To all his lands and lordships: when he returns,
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
This honorable day will never be seen.
Many times banishment Norfolk fought
For Jesus Christ in the glorious Christian field,
Disseminating the sign of the Christian cross
Against black pagans, Turks and Saracens:
And worked with war work he retired
In Italy; and there in Venice gave
His body on the earth of this pleasant country,
And his pure soul to his captain Christ,
Under whose colors he had fought so long.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, Bishop, did Norfolk die?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
As surely as I live, my lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Sweet peace leads her gentle soul to the bosom
Good old Abraham! Lords Appellant,
Your differences will all remain under gauge
Until we assign you your days of trial.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Grand Duke of Lancaster, I come to you
Of Richard plucked in feathers; who with a willing soul
Adopts you heir, and his high scepter gives way
To the possession of your royal hand:
Ascend his throne, now come down from him;
And long live Henry, fourth of this name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
In the name of God, I will ascend the royal throne.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Marry. God forgives!
The worst in this royal presence, may I speak,
But it's better that I tell the truth.
God would have someone in this noble presence
Were we noble enough to be an honest judge
From noble Richard! then true nobility would do it
Teach him to refrain from such heinous wrong.
What subject can pronounce judgment on his king?
And who is sitting here if not Richard's subject?
Thieves are not judged but they are there to hear,
Although an apparent guilt is visible in them;
And the figure of the majesty of God,
His captain, his steward, his deputy,
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
Be judged on the subject and the lower breath,
And he himself is not present? Oh, forgive him, my God,
That in a Christian climate souls are refined
Should show such a heinous, black and obscene act!
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
Recited by God, thus boldly for his king:
My lord of Hereford, whom you call king,
Is a vile traitor to the proud king of Hereford:
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
The blood of the English will fertilize the soil,
And future ages groan because of this vile act;
Peace will go to sleep with the Turks and the infidels,
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
Will be relatives with relatives and gentiles with gentiles mixed together;
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
Must live here, and this land will be called
The field of Golgotha and the skulls of the dead.
Oh, if you raise this house against this house,
It will be the saddest division that will prove it
Who has ever fallen on this cursed earth.
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
Lest children, children of children, cry out against you, woe!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well, have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
Of capital treason, we stop you here.
My Lord of Westminster, let it be your charge
To keep him safe until his day of trial.
May you, lords, grant the request of the commons.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bring here Richard, who is of the common opinion
He can surrender; so we will proceed
Without suspicion.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
I will be his conduct.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lords, you who are here under our arrest,
Get your guarantees for your response days.
We don't recognize your love,
And little was expected of your helping hands.

KING RICHARD II:
Alas, why am I sent for a king,
Before I rid myself of royal thoughts
With what did I reign? I have barely learned yet
To insinuate, flatter, tilt and bend my limbs:
Give sorrow some time to guide me
To this submission. Yet I remember well
The favors of these men: were they not mine?
Have they not sometimes shouted: “Hello everyone! volume?
Thus did Judas treat Christ: but he, in twelve,
I found the truth in all but one: me, in twelve thousand, none.
May God save the king! Will no one say amen?
Am I both priest and cleric? well, amen.
May God save the king! although I am not him;
And yet, amen, if heaven thinks so, it is me.
For what service am I sent here for?

THE DUKE OF YORK:
To do this work of your own good will
What tired majesty made you offer,
The resignation of your state and your crown
To Henry Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
Give me the crown. Here, cousin, grab the crown;
Here cousin:
On one side my hand, and on the other yours.
Now this golden crown is like a deep well
Who owes two buckets filling each other,
The emptiest still dancing in the air,
The other down, invisible and full of water:
This bucket down and full of tears I am,
Drink my sorrows, while you climb to the heights.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thought you were ready to quit.

KING RICHARD II:
My crown, I am; but my sorrows are always mine:
You can depose my glory and my state,
But not my sorrows; I am still the king of those.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Part of your care you give me with your crown.

KING RICHARD II:
Your worries don't take away my worries.
My care is a waste of care, by old care accomplished;
Your healing is a gain of healing, by new healing gained:
The care I give, I have, although given;
They take care of the crown, but they always stay with me.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Are you happy to give up the crown?

KING RICHARD II:
Yes No ; no Yes ; for I must be nothing;
So no no, because I resign myself to you.
Now mark me how I am going to undo myself;
I give this heavy weight off my head
And this cumbersome scepter in my hand,
The pride of royal influence issues from my heart;
With my own tears I wash away my balm,
With my own hands I give my crown,
With my own tongue, deny my sacred state,
With my own breath, release all the rites of duty:
I renounce all pomp and majesty;
I renounce my mansions, my rents, my income;
I deny my acts, decrees and statutes:
God forgive all the oaths that are broken to me!
God keep intact all the vows that swear to you!
Grant me that I have nothing, that I be afflicted with nothing,
And you are happy to have accomplished everything!
Long may you live in Richard's seat to sit,
And soon Richard will rest in an earthly pit!
God save King Harry, Richard, no king, said:
And send him many years of sunny days!
What more is left?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No more, but that you read
These serious accusations and crimes
Engaged by you and your followers
Against the State and the profit of this land;
That in confessing them, the souls of men
May consider that you are worthily deposited.

KING RICHARD II:
Do I have to do it ? and should I get out of it
My woven madness? Sweet Northumberland,
If your offenses were recorded,
Wouldn't it shame you in such a beautiful troop?
Read a lecture on them? If you wanted it,
There you should find a hateful article,
Containing the dismissal of a king
And breaking the strong mandate of an oath,
Marked with a stain, damned in the book of heaven:
No, all of you who stand and watch,
While my misery lures me,
Even if some of you with Pilate wash your hands
Show outward pity; yet you do Pilates
Have delivered me here to my bitter cross,
And water cannot wash away your sin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, hurry; read these articles.

KING RICHARD II:
My eyes are full of tears, I can't see:
And yet salt water doesn't blind them that much
But they see some sort of traitor here.
No, if I turn my eyes on myself,
I find myself treacherous with others;
For here I have given the consent of my soul
To dismantle the pompous body of a king;
Has made glory a basis and sovereignty a slave,
Proud majesty of a subject, declares a peasant.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
No lord of yours, you have insulted man,
Nor the lord of anyone; I have neither name nor title,
No, this name was not given to me at the police,
But it is usurped: alas, the day is heavy,
That I have worn so many winters,
And I don't know what name to give myself anymore!
Oh that I was a mocking king of the snow,
Standing before the Bolingbroke sun,
Melt into drops of water!
Good king, great king, and yet not very good,
And if my word is still valid in England,
Let him order a straight mirror here,
So that it shows me what face I have,
Since he is bankrupt from his majesty.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Some of you go get a mirror.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Read this document while the glass arrives.

KING RICHARD II:
Demon, you torment me before I come to hell!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Do not insist any further, my Lord Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The commons will then not be satisfied.

KING RICHARD II:
They will be satisfied: I will read enough,
When I see the book itself
Where all my sins are written, and that is myself.
Give me the glass and I'll read it.
No deeper wrinkles yet? has sorrow struck
So many blows on my face,
And didn't he make deeper wounds? O flattering glass,
Like my disciples in prosperity,
You are cheating on me ! Was this face the face
That every day under the roof of his house
Did you keep ten thousand men? was it the face
Did this, like the sun, make the spectators' eyes blink?
Was it the face that faced so much madness,
And was he finally beaten by Bolingbroke?
A fragile glory shines on this face:
As fragile as glory is the face;
Because there he is, broken into a hundred shudders.
Mark, silent king, the morality of this sport,
How long my grief has destroyed my face.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The shadow of your sorrow has destroyed
The shadow or your face.

KING RICHARD II:
Say that again.
The shadow of my sorrow! Ha! Let's see:
It’s very true, my grief is entirely internal;
And these external ways of lamenting
Are only shadows to invisible sorrow
It swells with silence in the tortured soul;
Therein lies the essential: and I thank you, king,
For your great generosity, which not only gives
I want to cry but you teach me the way
How to deplore the cause. I'm going to ask you a favor,
And then go away and don't bother you anymore.
Should I get it?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Say it, beautiful cousin.

KING RICHARD II:
" Pretty cousin " ? I am greater than a king:
Because when I was king, my flatterers
Were then only subjects; now being a subject,
I have a king here for my flatterer.
Being so big, I don't need to beg.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Still, ask.

KING RICHARD II:
And should I have it?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You should.

KING RICHARD II:
So give me permission to leave.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Or?

KING RICHARD II:
Wherever you wanted, I was out of your sight.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Come on, some of you are taking him to the Tower.

KING RICHARD II:
Oh good! to transmit? the conveyors are you all,
Who rises thus with agility by the fall of a true king.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Next Wednesday we solemnly settle down
Our crowning glory: Lords, prepare yourselves.

Abbe:
We witnessed a lamentable spectacle here.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Misfortune is coming; children yet to be born.
This day will seem as sharp as a thorn to them.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
You, holy ecclesiastics, is there no conspiracy
To rid the kingdom of this pernicious stain?

Abbe:
My lord,
Before freely saying what I think here,
You will not only partake of the sacrament
To bury the intentions of the mines, but also to realize
Whatever I can imagine.
I see that your eyebrows are full of discontent,
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
Come and have supper with me; and I'm going to lie down
A conspiracy will show us all a joyful day.

QUEEN:
This is how the king will come; this is the way
To the poorly erected tower of Julius Caesar,
In whose bosom my lord condemned
Is condemned to be a prisoner by the proud Bolingbroke:
Let us rest here, if this rebellious land
Give the queen a rest from her true king.
But sweet, but see, or rather don't see,
My beautiful rose withers: but lift up your eyes, behold,
So that, through pity, you may dissolve into dew,
And wash it away again with tears of true love.
Ah, you, the model where old Troy stood,
You, card of honor, you, tomb of King Richard,
And not King Richard; you are the most beautiful inn,
Why should sorrow hard favored be lodged in thee,
When does the triumph become a guest of the brewery?

KING RICHARD II:
Do not join in sorrow, beautiful woman, do not,
To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
Consider our former state as a happy dream;
From where the truth of what we are awoke
He only shows us this: I am my sworn brother, my sweet one,
To the dark necessity, and he and I
Will keep a league until death. Hello to you in France
And lock yourself in some religious house:
Our holy lives must win the crown of a new world,
That our secular hours here have been canceled.

QUEEN:
What, is my Richard both in form and in spirit
Transformed and weakened? Has Bolingbroke been trademarked
Your intellect? is he in your heart?
The dying lion stretches out his paw,
And hurt the earth, at least, with rage
Be under control; and you want, like a student,
Take your correction gently, kiss the rod,
And wild with rage with base humility,
What is a lion and a king of beasts?

KING RICHARD II:
A king of beasts, indeed; if anything other than animals,
I was still a happy king of men.
Good queen, prepare yourself for France:
Think that I am dead and that even here you take,
From my deathbed, your last living leave.
During the tedious nights of winter, sit by the fire
With good old people and let them tell you stories
Lamentable ages, long ago;
And before wishing them good night, to put an end to their sorrows,
Tell yourself the sad story of me
And sends the listeners to cry in their beds:
Why Foolish Brands Will Sympathize
The heavy accent of your moving tongue
And with compassion cry for fire;
And some will cry in the ashes, others in the coal black,
For the removal of a legitimate king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, Bolingbroke's mind has changed:
You need to go to Pomfret, not the Tower.
And, madame, the order is taken for you;
At full speed, you must leave for France.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, you have a ladder with which
The rising Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
The time should not be several hours
More than he was before heinous sin gathered his head
You will sink into corruption: you will think,
Although he divides the kingdom and gives you half of it,
It's too little, helping him with everything;
And he will think that you, who know the way
To plant unjust kings, I will still know,
Never in such a hurry, in another way
To tear him headlong from the usurped throne.
The love of the wicked turns into fear;
This fear of hating, and hatred transforms one or both
To worthy danger and deserved death.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My guilt rests on my head, and that is an end.
Take your leave and go; because you must separate immediately.

KING RICHARD II:
Double divorced! Bad men, you rape
A double marriage, between my crown and me,
And then between me and my married woman.
Let me break the oath between you and me;
And yet this is not the case, because it was done with a kiss.
Separate us, Northumberland; I'm heading north,
Where cold and disease ravage the climate;
My wife in France: from where, leaving in pomp,
She came here dressed like sweet May,
Dismissed as Hallowmas or the Shortest Day.

QUEEN:
And should we be divided? should we separate?

KING RICHARD II:
Yes, hand in hand, my love, and heart in heart.

QUEEN:
Banish us both and send the king with me.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It was a little love but little politics.

QUEEN:
So where he's going, let me go.

KING RICHARD II:
So two crying together make one misfortune.
Cry for me in France, me for you here;
Far is better than near, never be close.
Go, count your way while sighing; I mine with moans.

QUEEN:
The longest path will therefore have the longest groans.

KING RICHARD II:
Twice for one step I will groan, the path being short,
And chart the path forward with a heavy heart.
Come, come, to woo sorrow, let's be brief,
Since then, the marriage has been so long in sorrow;
A kiss will close our mouths and stupidly separate us;
So I give mine, and so I take your heart.

QUEEN:
Give me mine again; it was not a good role
Take me to guard and kill your heart.
So, now I have mine again, go,
So that I can strive to kill him with a whimper.

KING RICHARD II:
We are making misfortune with this affectionate delay:
Once again, farewell; the rest lets the sorrow speak.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
When the tears made you interrupt the story,
of our two cousins coming to London.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Where have I gone?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
At this sad stop, my lord,
Where crude and ill-governed hands from above the windows
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Then, as I said, the Duke, the great Bolingbroke,
Mounted on a burning and fiery steed
What his aspiring rider seemed to know,
With a slow but majestic pace kept on its course,
While all tongues cried "God save you,
Boling Broke!
You would have thought that the very windows were speaking,
So many greedy looks from young and old
Through the doors their longing eyes flashed
On his face, and all the walls
With painted images he had said immediately
“Jesus, protect yourself! welcome, Bolingbroke!
While he, turning from side to side,
Bare head, lower than the neck of his proud steed,
Speak to them thus: “I thank you, compatriots:”
And so he continued to do it, so he passed on.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas, poor Richard! where did he go during this time?

THE DUKE OF YORK:
As in the theater, the eyes of men,
After a distinguished actor leaves the stage,
Are lazily leaning over whoever enters next,
Thinking that his chatter is tedious;
Yet, or with much more contempt, the eyes of men
I looked at kind Richard sullenly; no man cried “God save him!”
No cheerful tongue welcomed him home:
But dust was thrown on his sacred head:
Which he shook with such sweet sadness,
Her face still struggling with tears and smiles,
The badges of his sorrow and his patience,
God had not, for some mighty purpose, strengthened
The hearts of men must have melted
And barbarism itself took pity on him.
But heaven has a hand in these events,
At the top of whom will we want to link our calm content.
We are now sworn subjects of Bolingbroke,
Whose state and honor I authorize.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
This is my son Aumerle.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
It was Aumerle;
But it's lost to be Richard's friend,
And, ma'am, you must call him Rutland now:
I'm in Parliament and I promise its truth
And lasting loyalty to the new king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
Who sprinkles the green lap of the new spring?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Madam, I don't know anything about it and I don't care:
God knows I wanted just as much to be just one.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Well, be well in this new spring of time,
Lest you get cut off before you get to the primer.
What news from Oxford? hold these righteous people and these triumphs?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
As far as I know, my lord, this is the case.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
You will be there, I know.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
If God doesn't forbid it, I intend to.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
What is this seal that hangs from your bosom?
Yeah, you look pale? let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My lord, it's nothing.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
So it doesn't matter who sees it;
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I beg Your Grace to forgive me:
It's a matter of little consequence,
Which, for certain reasons, I would not have seen.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
And for some reason, sir, I want to see it.
I'm scared, I'm scared...

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What should we fear?
It is nothing but a bond in which it is concluded
For gay clothing against the day of triumph.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Linked to himself! what does he do with a link
That he has to? Woman, you are an idiot.
Boy, let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I beg you, forgive me; I can't show it.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
I will be satisfied; let me see, I said.
Treason! vile betrayal! Wicked! traitor! slave!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is it, my lord?

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Ho! who is in there?
Saddle my horse.
God for his mercy, what betrayal here!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, what is it, my lord?

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots, I said; saddle my horse.
Now, by my honor, by my life, by my faith,
I'm going to call the bad guy.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the problem?

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Peace, stupid woman.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will not make peace. What is it, Aumerle?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Good mother, be happy; it's no more
So my poor life must respond.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Your life responds!

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Bring me my boots: I will do it to the king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hit him, Aumerle. Poor boy, you are surprised.
So, naughty! will never come into my sight again.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots, I said.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, York, what are you going to do?
Won't you hide your fault?
Do we have more sons? or do we like to have?
Isn't my busy date drunk on time?
And will you snatch my beautiful son from my age,
And steal the name of a happy mother from me?
Isn't he like you? Isn't it yours?

THE DUKE OF YORK:
You love the crazy one,
Do you want to hide this dark conspiracy?
A dozen of them here have taken the sacrament,
And indiscriminately they placed their hands,
Kill the King at Oxford.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
There will be none;
We'll keep him here: so what does that do to him?

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Go away, dear woman! was he twenty times my son,
I would approach him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Would you have moaned for him
As I did it, you would be more pitiful.
But now I know your spirit; you suspect
That I have been disloyal to your bed,
And that he's a bastard, not your son:
Sweet York, sweet husband, do not be in this spirit:
He looks as much like you as a man can,
Not like me, nor any of my loved ones,
And yet I love him.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Walk away, unruly woman!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Afterwards, Aumerle! rides on his horse;
Ram the post, and arrive before him near the king,
And ask for forgiveness before he accuses you.
I won't be far behind; even though I am old,
I have no doubt I'll ride as fast as York:
And I will never rise from the ground
Until Bolingbroke has forgiven you. Go, go!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no one tell me about my unthrifty son?
It's been three months since I last saw him;
If there is a scourge hanging over us, it is him.
I would to God, my lords, that it might be found:
Ask in London, among the taverns there,
For there, they say, he frequents daily,
With free and unrestrained companions,
Even those who, they say, stand in the narrow streets,
And beat our watch, and steal our passengers;
And he, an effeminate and wanton young boy,
Takes the point of honor to support
So it’s a dissolute crew.

HENRY PERCY:
Monsignor, it is about two days since I saw the prince,
And told him about these triumphs won at Oxford.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And what did the gallant say?

HENRY PERCY:
His response was: he would go to the stews,
And from the most common creature, tear off a glove,
And wear it as a favor; And with that
He would unhorse the most vigorous challenger.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As dissolute as he is desperate; yet through both
I see sparks of a better hope, whose older years
Can happily give birth. But who comes here?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the king?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What does our cousin mean, let him look and look
So wildly?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
God keep your grace! I beg Your Majesty,
Have a conference with Your Grace alone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Withdraw and leave us here alone.
What's wrong with our cousin now?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
May my knees join the earth forever,
My tongue clings to my roof in my mouth
Unless you get my forgiveness before you get up or speak.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Was this mistake intentional or committed?
If from the first, how odious it is,
To earn your love, I forgive you.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
So give me permission so I can turn the key,
Let no one enter until my story is finished.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Have your desire.

THE DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bad guy, I'll get you to safety.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Stop your avenging hand; you have no reason to fear.

THE DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What is it, uncle? talk;
Recover your breath; tell us how near the danger is,
So that we can arm ourselves to face it.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Go through this writing here, and you will know
The betrayal that my haste forbids me to show.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Remember, as you read, your promise has been kept:
I repent; don't read my name there
My heart is not complicit with my hand.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
It was, wicked one, before your hand laid it.
I have torn him from the breast of the traitor, king;
Fear, not love, generates his penance:
Forget to pity him, lest your pity prove
A snake that will sting you to the heart.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O odious, strong and daring conspiracy!
O faithful father of a treacherous son!
You, pure, immaculate and silvery fountain,
Since when does this stream cross muddy passages
Retained his current and soiled himself!
Your excess of good turns into evil,
And your abundant kindness will excuse
This deadly stain in your digressing son.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Thus my virtue will be the debauchery of his vice;
And he will spend my honor with his shame,
As thrifty sons, their fathers scraped for gold.
My honor lives when his dishonor dies,
Or my shameful life lies in his dishonor:
You killed me in his life; giving him breath,
The traitor lives, the true man is put to death.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Which high-voiced supplicant utters this eager cry?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A woman and your aunt, great king; it's me.
Talk to me, pity me, open the door.
A beggar begs like never before.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Our scene is changed from a serious thing,
And now changed to “The Beggar and the King”.
My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
I know she came to pray for your foul sin.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
If you forgive everyone who prays,
More sins could flourish because of this forgiveness.
This infected joint has been cut, the rest remains healthy;
And even less will it confuse everything else.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O king, do not believe this hard-hearted man!
Love does not love itself, no one else can.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
You, unbridled woman, what are you doing here?
Will your old hovel be a traitor again?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Sweet York, be patient. Listen to me, sweet lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Get up, good aunt.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Not yet, I beg you:
I will always walk on my knees,
And never see the day that the happy see,
Until you give joy; until you give me joy,
By forgiving Rutland, my transgressor boy.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
At my mother's prayers, I bend my knee.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Against them, my two true joints buckled.
You will not be able to prosper if you grant grace!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Is he seriously pleading? look at his face;
His eyes shed no tears, his prayers are pleasant;
His words come from his mouth, ours from our bosom:
He prays only weakly and would be refused;
We pray with heart and soul and alongside:
His tired joints would gladly rise again, I know;
Our knees will kneel until they push to the ground:
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
We are of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers surpass his; so let them have
This mercy that true prayer should have.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, get up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, don’t say “stand up”;
First say “sorry,” then “stand up.”
And if I were your nurse, your tongue to teach,
“Sorry” should be the first word of your speech.
I never wanted to hear a word until now;
Say “pardon,” king; may pity teach you how:
The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
There is no word like “forgiveness” for the lips of kings, so surrender.

THE DUKE OF YORK:
Speak it in French, king; say, “Forgive me.”

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Do you teach forgiveness forgiveness to destroy?
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
This pits the word itself against the word!
Speak “forgiveness,” as is common in our country;
We don't understand broken French.
Your eye begins to speak; put your tongue there;
Or, in your pitiful heart, plant your ear;
May hearing how our complaints and our prayers pierce,
Pity can push you to “forgive” to repeat.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, get up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'm not suing;
Forgiveness is all I have in my hand.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I forgive him, as God will forgive me.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O happy sight of a kneeling knee!
Yet I am sick with fear: speak of it again;
Saying “sorry” twice does not forgive both,
But it makes forgiveness strong.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
With all my heart
I forgive him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
You are a god on earth.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
But for our faithful brother-in-law and the abbot,
With all the rest of this consorted crew,
Direct destruction will follow on their heels.
Good uncle, help command several powers
To Oxford, or wherever these traitors are:
They won't live in this world, I swear,
But I will get them, if I ever know where.
My uncle, farewell; and, cousin too, farewell:
Your mother prayed well and proved your truthfulness to you.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Come, my old son: I pray that God will make you new.

EXTON:
Have you not noticed the king, the words he spoke,
“Have I no friend who would rid me of this living fear?
Wasn't that so?

Servant:
These are his own words.

EXTON:
“I don’t have a friend?” he said: he said it twice,
And he pushed it together twice, didn't he?

Servant:
He did.

EXTON:
And while speaking thus, he looked at me with a nostalgic look,
And who should say: "I wish you were the man"
It would take this terror away from my heart;
That is to say the king at Pomfret. Come on, let's go:
I am the king's friend and I will rid his enemy.

KING RICHARD II:
I studied how I could compare
This prison where I live in the world:
And because the world is populated
And behold, there is no creature other than myself,
I can not do it; but I will solve it.
My brain, I will prove the female to my soul,
My soul the father; and these two generate
A generation of thoughts still reproducing,
And these same thoughts populate this little world,
In a mood like the people of this world,
Because no thought is happy. The best kind,
As thoughts of divine things mingle
With scruples and puts the word itself
Against the word:
Like so: “Come, little ones,” and then again:
"It's as difficult to come as it is for a camel
To thread the postern with a small eye of a needle.
Thoughts tend towards ambition, they plot
Improbable wonders; how these vain weak nails
Can tear a passage through flint ribs
From this harsh world, from my tattered prison walls,
And, because they cannot, die in their own pride.
Thoughts tending towards content flatter themselves
That they are not the first slaves of fortune,
It won't be the last either; like stupid beggars
Who sit in the vines and hide their shame,
Many have done it and others must remain there;
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
Carry their own misfortunes on their backs
Of those who have already endured the same.
So I play in one person with several people,
And no one is happy: sometimes I am king;
So betrayals make me wish myself a beggar,
And that's what I am: then crushing misery
Convinces me that I was better when I was king;
So I am king again: and little by little
I think I'm not king by Bolingbroke,
And I am nothing: but whatever I am,
Neither me nor any other man but man.
Nothing will be happy with, until it is relieved
By being nothing. Music do I hear?
Ha, ha! keep time: as the music is bittersweet,
When time is broken and no proportion is respected!
It is the same in the music of men's lives.
And there you have it, I have the delicacy of the ear
To check the time, it broke into a disorderly chain;
But for the harmony of my state and my time
I didn't have an ear to hear my true broken time.
I wasted time, and now time is wasting me;
For now, time has made me its digital clock:
My thoughts last for minutes; and with sighs they shake
Their watches over my eyes, the external surveillance,
Where is my finger, like the tip of a dial,
He always points, cleaning them of tears.
Now sir, the sound that tells you what time it is
Are loud moans that strike my heart,
What is the bell: then sighs, tears and groans
Show minutes, hours and hours: but my time
He posts messages in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
While I stay here fooling around, it's Jack o' the clock.
This music drives me crazy; that it no longer rings;
Because even though it helped the madmen regain their minds,
It seems to me that this will drive wise people crazy.
Yet blessing on his heart which gives it to me!
Because it is a sign of love; and I love Richard
It's a strange brooch in this world that hates everything.

Married:
Hello, royal prince!

KING RICHARD II:
Thank you, noble peer;
The cheapest among us is ten groats too expensive.
What are you ? and how do you come here,
Where no man ever comes except this sad dog
Does it bring me food to keep misfortune alive?

Married:
I was a poor groom in your stable, king,
When you were king; who, traveling towards York,
With much ado I finally got a leave of absence
Watching the face of my sometimes royal master.
O, how my heart ached when I saw
In the streets of London, this coronation day,
When Bolingbroke rode the Barbary roan,
This horse that you have ridden so often,
This horse that I dressed so carefully!

KING RICHARD II:
Did he climb Barbary? Tell me, sweet friend,
How did it go under him?

Married:
So proudly as if he disdained the ground.

KING RICHARD II:
So proud to have Bolingbroke on his back!
This jade has eaten the bread from my royal hand;
This hand made him proud by applauding him.
Wouldn't he stumble? would he not fall,
Since pride must fall and break its neck
Of this proud man who usurped his back?
Sorry, horse! why am I picking on you,
Since you, created to be impressed by man,
Was I born to endure? I was not made a horse;
And yet I carry a burden like a donkey,
Stimulated, irritated and tired by Bolingbroke's jump.

Guardian:
Friend, give way; here, there is no longer any stay.

KING RICHARD II:
If you love me, it's time for you to leave.

Married:
What my tongue does not dare, my heart will say.

Guardian:
My lord, would you not like to fall?

KING RICHARD II:
Taste some first, as you usually do.

Guardian:
My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
recently come from the king, orders the opposite.

KING RICHARD II:
May the devil take Henry of Lancaster and you!
Patience is boring and I'm tired of it.

Guardian:
Help, help, help!

KING RICHARD II:
How now! what does death mean in this brutal assault?
Wicked, your own hand yields the instrument of your death.
Go ahead and fill another room of hell.
This hand will burn in a fire that never goes out
This astounds me. Exton, your fierce hand
He has stained the king's own land with the king's blood.
Come up, come up, my soul! your seat is upstairs;
As my gross flesh sinks downward, I am here to die.

EXTON:
As full of valor as of royal blood:
I overturned both; Oh, if the action was good!
For now the devil, who told me that I had done well,
He says this act is recounted in hell.
This dead king to the living king, I will carry him
So take the rest and bury them here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Kind Uncle York, the latest we hear
It is because the rebels have consumed by fire
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
But whether they will be captured or killed, we don't know.
Welcome, my lord, what is the news?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
First, to your sacred state, I wish all happiness.
The next news is that I am to be sent to London
The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt and Kent:
The way to take them may appear
Generally discussed in this article here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
We thank you, sweet Percy, for your troubles;
And to your value will be added just and worthy gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
My lord, I have been sent from Oxford to London
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
Two of the group's dangerous traitors
Who sought in Oxford your terrible overthrow.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thy sorrows, Fitzwater, shall not be forgotten;
Your merit is very noble, well, I know it.

HENRY PERCY:
The great conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
With a clouded conscience and sour melancholy
Delivered his body to the grave;
But here is Carlisle alive, to remain
Your royal condemnation and the sentence of his pride.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Carlisle, this is your destiny:
Choose a secret place, a reverend's room,
More than you have, and with it, rejoice your life;
So, while you live in peace, die without conflict:
For although you have always been my enemy,
I saw great sparks of honor in you.

EXTON:
Great king, in this coffin I present
Your buried fear: here all the breathless lies
The most powerful of your greatest enemies,
Richard of Bordeaux, whom I brought here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Exton, I don't thank you; because you worked
An act of slander from your fatal hand
On my head and all this famous earth.

EXTON:
It is from your own mouth, my lord, that I have done this deed.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
They don't like poison that poison needs,
You neither: even if I wished him dead,
I hate the murderer, I love him murdered.
The guilt of conscience do you take for your work,
But neither my good word nor princely favor:
With Cain, will wander in the shadows of the night,
And never show your face in the daytime or in the light.
Lords, I protest, my soul is full of misfortune,
This blood should water me to make me grow:
Come, cry with me what I deplore,
And put on a moody black incontinent:
I will take a trip to the Holy Land,
To wash this blood from my guilty hand:
Walks sadly afterwards; honor my mourning here;
Crying after that untimely beer.


SAMPSON:
Gregory, my word, we will not transport coal.

GREGORY:
No, because then we would be coal miners.

SAMPSON:
I mean, if we're angry, we'll draw lots.

GREGORY:
Yes, while you are alive, remove your neck from the collar.

SAMPSON:
I knock quickly, being moved.

GREGORY:
But you are not quick to strike.

SAMPSON:
A dog from Montague's house moves me.

GREGORY:
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand up:
therefore, if you are moved, you run away.

SAMPSON:
A dog in this house will push me to get up: I will
take the wall from any man or maid in Montague.

GREGORY:
This shows you a weak slave; because the weakest are leaving
on the wall.

SAMPSON:
TRUE; and therefore women, being the weakest vessels,
are always pushed against the wall: that's why I will push
Montague's men from the wall and pushed his maids
on the wall.

GREGORY:
The quarrel is between our masters and us, their men.

SAMPSON:
It's all one, I will show myself to be a tyrant: when I
I have fought with men, I will be cruel to them
servants and cut off their heads.

GREGORY:
The chief servants?

SAMPSON:
Yes, the heads of the servants, or their virgins;
take it in whatever direction you want.

GREGORY:
They have to take it in the sense of feeling it.

SAMPSON:
Me, they will smell me while I am able to stand: and
we know that I am a pretty piece of flesh.

GREGORY:
It’s good that you’re not a fish; if you had done it, you
you had been poor John. Draw your tool! Here is
two from the house of Montaigu.

SAMPSON:
My naked weapon is drawn: quarrel, I will support you.

GREGORY:
How! turn around and run?

SAMPSON:
Do not fear me.

GREGORY:
No, get married; I fear you!

SAMPSON:
Let us take the law on our side; let them begin.

GREGORY:
I'll frown as I pass and let them take it as
they list.

SAMPSON:
No, as they dare. I will bite their thumb;
which is a shame for them, if they put up with it.

ABRAHAM:
Are you biting our thumb, sir?

SAMPSON:
I'm biting my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM:
Are you biting our thumb, sir?

SAMPSON:

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
No, sir, I'm not biting your thumb, sir, but I
bite my thumb, sir.

GREGORY:
Are you arguing, sir?

ABRAHAM:
Quarrel sir! no sir.

SAMPSON:
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve a man as good as you.

ABRAHAM:
Not better.

SAMPSON:
Well, sir.

GREGORY:
Say “better”: here is one of my master’s relatives.

SAMPSON:
Yes, better, sir.

ABRAHAM:
You lie.

SAMPSON:
Draw, if you are men. Gregory, remember your violent blow.

BENVOLIO:
Leave, you fools!
Put on your swords; you don't know what you're doing.

TYBALT:
What, are you drawn among these heartless deer?
Turn around, Benvolio, look at your death.

BENVOLIO:
I only keep the peace: raise your sword,
Or manage to separate these men from me.

TYBALT:
What, draw, and talk about peace! I hate the word,
How I hate hell, all the Montagues and you:
To you, coward!

First citizen:
Clubs, Bills and Supporters! strike! shoot them down!
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

CAPULET:
What noise is it? Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULET:
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

CAPULET:
My sword, I say! Old Montague has arrived,
And brandished his blade despite myself.

ASSEMBLY :
You wicked Capulet, don't hold me back, let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE:
You will not move a foot to look for an enemy.

PRINCE:
Rebellious subjects, enemies of peace,
Desecrators of this steel stained by the neighbor,
Won't they hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
Who extinguishes the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains flowing from your veins,
Under penalty of torture, from these bloody hands
Throw your damaged weapons to the ground,
And listen to the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil fights, born from an airy word,
By you, old Capulet and Montague,
I have three times disturbed the calm of our streets,
And made former citizens of Verona
Thrown away by their ornaments worthy of their tomb,
Handling old partisans, in such old hands,
Canker of peace, to separate your hatred from canker:
If you ever disturb our streets again,
Your lives will pay the price for peace.
This time, everyone else is leaving:
You Capulet; will accompany me:
And, Montague, come this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure in this matter,
Towards the Old Free City, our common place of judgment.
Once again, under penalty of death, all the men leave.

ASSEMBLY :
Who gave a new dimension to this old feud?
Speak up, nephew, were you there when this started?

BENVOLIO:
Here are the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close combat before I approach:
I drew to separate them: the moment has come
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he whispered defiance into my ears,
He turned his head and cut off the winds,
To whom nothing hurt, he hissed with contempt:
While we exchanged blows and blows,
I came more and more and fought partly,
Until the prince came, who separated the two parties.

LADY MONTAGUE:
O, where is Romeo? have you seen him today?
I'm really glad he wasn't at that scrimmage.

BENVOLIO:
Madam, an hour before the sun adored
I looked through the golden east window,
A troubled spirit impelled me to go abroad;
Where, under the sycamore grove
Which takes root in the west side of the city,
It was so early that I saw your son while walking:
I went towards him, but he was wary of me
And he slipped into the secret of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own means,
That most are busy when they are most alone,
I pursued my humor without pursuing his,
And I gladly avoided him who gladly shunned me.

ASSEMBLY :
We saw him there many mornings,
With tears increasing the fresh dew of the morning.
Adding more clouds to the clouds with his deep sighs;
But all this as soon as the encouraging sun
Should he, in the far east, start drawing
The shadowy curtains of Aurora's bed,
Far from the light flies home my heavy son,
And the soldier locks himself in his room,
Close your windows, lock out the daylight
And an artificial night is created:
This humor must be dark and sinister,
Unless good advice can make the cause disappear.

BENVOLIO:
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

ASSEMBLY :
I don't know and I can't learn more about him.

BENVOLIO:
Did you bother him in any way?

ASSEMBLY :
By myself and many other friends:
But he, counselor of his own affections,
Is it for himself--I won't say how true it is--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from probing and discovery,
Like the bud bitten by an envious worm,
Before it can spread its sweet leaves into the air,
Or dedicate its beauty to the sun.
Could we only learn where his sorrows originate.
We would be as gladly curative as we know how.

BENVOLIO:
See where he's coming: then please step aside;
I will know his grievance, or I will be widely denied.

ASSEMBLY :
I wish you were so happy with your stay,
To hear the truth. Come, madam, let's go.

BENVOLIO:
Hello cousin.

ROMEO:
Is the day so young?

BENVOLIO:
But nine o'clock struck.

ROMEO:
Yes me! the sad hours seem long.
Was it my father who left so quickly?

BENVOLIO:
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO:
Not having that makes them small.

BENVOLIO:
Lover?

ROMEO:
Out--

BENVOLIO:
Of love?

ROMEO:
Out of his favor, where I am in love.

BENVOLIO:
Alas, this love, so sweet in his eyes,
This should be so tyrannical and so hard to prove!

ROMEO:
Alas, this love, the sight of which is still stifled,
Must, without eyes, see the paths leading to his will!
Where are we going to have dinner? O me! What fight was going on here?
But don't tell me, because I've heard everything.
This has a lot to do with hatred, but more to do with love.
Well, oh brawling love! O loving hatred!
O anything, anything, create first!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Distorted chaos of shapes that look good!
Plume of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Sleep while still awake, that's not it!
This love, I feel it, I who feel no love in this.
Aren't you laughing?

BENVOLIO:
No, because I prefer to cry.

ROMEO:
Good heart, for what?

BENVOLIO:
To the oppression of your good heart.

ROMEO:
Well, such is the transgression of love.
My own sorrows weigh heavily in my chest,
That you will propagate, so that it remains
With more of yours: that love you showed
This adds even more heartache to too much of my own suffering.
Love is a smoke that rises with the smoke of sighs;
To be purged, a fire sparkling in the eyes of lovers;
To be vexed by a sea nourished by the tears of lovers:
What else is it? a most discreet madness,
A stifling gall and a preservative candy.
Farewell, my cousin.

BENVOLIO:
Soft! I go ;
And if you leave me like this, you're hurting me.

ROMEO:
But I got lost; I'm not here;
It's not Romeo, it's another where.

BENVOLIO:
Tell me with sadness, who do you love.

ROMEO:
What, should I moan and tell you?

BENVOLIO:
Groan! why no.
But unfortunately, tell me who.

ROMEO:
Tell a sad sick person to make his will:
Ah, evil words to one who is so ill!
Unfortunately, cousin, I love a woman.

BENVOLIO:
I aimed so close, when I thought you liked it.

ROMEO:
A real good shooter! And she's blonde, I love it.

BENVOLIO:
A good grade just, just because, is hit the earliest.

ROMEO:
Well, in this shot you miss: she won't be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she has the spirit of Dian;
And, as proof of chastity, well armed,
From the weak childish bow of love she lives unscathed.
She will not resist the siege of amorous terms,
Nor wait for the encounter of aggressive looks,
Nor open his knees to holy-seductive gold:
Oh, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
That when she dies with beauty, her store dies.

BENVOLIO:
So she swore she would always live chaste?

ROMEO:
She did it, and by saving this she generates enormous waste,
For the beauty hungry for its severity
Cut off the beauty of all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To deserve happiness by making me despair:
She gave up loving, and in this vow
Do I live dead and live to tell now.

BENVOLIO:
Be governed by me, forget to think about her.

ROMEO:
O, teach me how to forget to think.

BENVOLIO:
By giving freedom to your eyes;
Examine other beauties.

ROMEO:
It's like that
To qualify hers as exquisite, in question more:
These joyful masks that kiss the eyebrows of beautiful ladies
Being black makes us think they are hiding the fair;
He who is blinded cannot forget
The precious treasure of his lost sight:
Show me a mistress who looks good,
What is the use of its beauty, if not as a note
Where can I read who passed this passing fair?
Farewell: you can't teach me to forget.

BENVOLIO:
I will pay for this doctrine, or I will die in debt.

CAPULET:
But Montague is bound as well as I,
Also for penalties; and it's not difficult, I think,
For men as old as us to keep the peace.

PARIS:
You are both honorable;
And it's a shame that you lived at odds for so long.
But now, my lord, what do you say about my trial?

CAPULET:
But I repeat what I already said:
My child is, however, a stranger in the world;
She hasn't seen change in fourteen years,
Let two more summers fade in their pride,
We might think she was ready to become a wife.

PARIS:
Younger than her, they are happy mothers.

CAPULET:
And too soon those that were made so early are wasted.
The earth has swallowed up all my hopes but it,
She is the hopeful lady of my land:
But court her, sweet Paris, recover her heart,
My desire to obtain his consent is only part;
And she agrees, within the limits of her choice
Lies my consent and just according to my voice.
Tonight I'm throwing a regular old party,
Where I invited many guests,
As I like; and you, among the store,
One more, welcome, increases my number.
In my poor house, look at this night
Stars that walk the Earth and light up the dark sky:
Such comfort that vigorous young men feel
When April well dressed on the heel
Lame winter walks, even such a delight
Among the fresh feminine buds you will be this night
Inherit at home; I hear everything, I see everything,
And as the one whose merit will be greatest:
Which, on a larger scale, among many others, mine is one
Perhaps in number, but without counting any,
Come, come with me.
Come on, sir, trudge on
By the Verona fair; find these people
Whose names are written there, and tell them:
My house and welcome for their pleasure stay.

Servant:
Discover those whose names are written here! It is
written, that the shoemaker must mind his own
yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisherman with
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
sent to find the people whose names are here
written, and I never find the name of the writing
no one here has a brief. I must address the scholars. - In proper time.

BENVOLIO:
But, man, one fire burns another's burn,
One pain is alleviated by the anguish of another;
Become dizzy and be helped by turning backwards;
One desperate sorrow heals with the languor of another:
Get a new infection in your eye,
And the infamous poison of the old will die.

ROMEO:
Your plaintain sheet is excellent for this.

BENVOLIO:
For what, I pray you?

ROMEO:
For your broken shin.

BENVOLIO:
Why, Romeo, are you crazy?

ROMEO:
Not crazy, but bound more than crazy;
Locked up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipped and tormented and... God, good boy.

Servant:
God give it to God. Please, sir, can you read?

ROMEO:
Yes, my own fortune in my misery.

Servant:
Perhaps you learned it without a book: but, I
Please, can you read everything you see?

ROMEO:
Yes, if I know the letters and the language.

Servant:
You honestly say: rest, cheerful!

ROMEO:
Stay, my friend; I can read.
“Signor Martino, his wife and daughters;
the county of Anselme and its sisters-in-law; the Lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his charming
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
Uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my beautiful niece
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
Tybalt, Lucio and lively Helena. A fair
assembly: where should they come?

Servant:
Up.

ROMEO:
Or?

Servant:
Supper; to our house.

ROMEO:
Whose house?

Servant:
My teacher.

ROMEO:
Actually, I should have asked you first.

Servant:
Now I will tell you without asking: my master is the
the great rich Capulet; and if you're not from home
de Montagues, please come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest happily!

BENVOLIO:
At that same old Capulet party
Imagine the beautiful Rosaline that you love so much,
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
Go for it ; and, with an unknown eye,
Compare his face with some that I will show,
And I will make you believe that your swan is a raven.

ROMEO:
When the pious religion of my eyes
Maintains such a lie, then turns her tears into fires;
And those who often drowned could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burned for liars!
A more beautiful one than my love! the sun that sees everything
I have never seen his equal since the creation of the world.

BENVOLIO:
But you saw her beautiful, no one else was there,
Itself in balance with itself in each eye:
But in this crystal balance, we can weigh
Your wife's love against another maid
That I will show you brilliant at this party,
And it will hardly show what is now more visible.

ROMEO:
I'll go, nothing like that to show,
But to rejoice in my own splendor.

LADY CAPULET:
Nurse, where is my daughter? call her to me.

Nurse:
Now, near my virginity, at twelve years old,
I told him to come. What, lamb! what, ladybug!
God forgives! Where is this girl? What, Juliette!

JULIET:
How now! who calls ?

Nurse:
Your mother.

JULIET:
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

LADY CAPULET:
Here is the question: nurse, give leave for a moment,
We must speak in secret: nurse, come back;
I remember me, you heard our advice.
You know that my daughter is of a beautiful age.

Nurse:
My goodness, I can give his age up to an hour.

LADY CAPULET:
She's not fourteen.

Nurse:
I will put fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, let it be said about my teeth, I only have four...
She's not fourteen. How much time is left now
At the Lammas tide?

LADY CAPULET:
A fortnight and odd days.

Nurse:
Even or odd, every day of the year,
Come Lammas Eve, she will be fourteen.
Susan and her--God rest all Christian souls!--
We were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
On the night of Lammas, she will be fourteen years old;
This is what she will marry; I remember it well.
It has now been eleven years since the earthquake;
And she was weaned, I will never forget it.
Of all the days of the year, on this day:
Because I then put wormwood in my burrow,
Sitting in the sun under the wall of the dovecote;
Monsignor and you were then in Mantua:
No, I have a brain: but, as I said,
When he tasted wormwood on the nipple
From my dug and I felt it bitter, rather stupid,
To see him irritable and quarreling with the dug!
Shake, said the dovecote: it was not necessary, I think,
To make me walk painfully:
And since then it has been eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; no, near the rood screen,
She could have run and waddled anywhere;
Because just the day before, she broke her forehead:
And then my husband, may God be with his soul!
A' was a cheerful man - he took the child:
“Yes,” he said, “are you falling on your face?”
You will fall back when you have more spirit;
Isn't that right, Jule? and, by my vacation,
The pretty wretch left crying and said “Yes.”
Now let's see how a joke will turn out!
I guarantee it, and I should live a thousand years,
I should never forget: “Will you, Jule? he said;
And, stupid enough, he stopped and said “Yes.”

LADY CAPULET:
Enough of that; Please be quiet.

Nurse:
Yes, madam: yet I can only laugh,
Saying he should leave crying and say “Yes”.
And yet, I guarantee it, he had on his forehead
A bump as big as a cock's stone;
A perplexed blow; and he cried bitterly:
“Yes,” said my husband, “are you falling on your face?”
You will fall back when you grow old;
Isn't that right, Jule? he hesitated and said “Yes”.

JULIET:
And you too, please, nurse, I said.

Nurse:
Peace, I did it. God reserves his grace for you!
You were the prettiest baby I ever breastfed:
And I might live to see you married once,
I have my wish.

LADY CAPULET:
Getting married, this “getting married” is the very theme
I came to talk about it. Tell me, my daughter Juliette,
How ready are you to get married?

JULIET:
It’s an honor I couldn’t dream of.

Nurse:
An honor! Was I not your only nurse,
I would say you have sucked wisdom from your breast.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, think about marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are already made mothers: in my opinion,
I was your mother during those years
That you are now a maid. So in short:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

Nurse:
A man, young woman! madam, such a man
Like everyone else... well, he's a wax man.

LADY CAPULET:
Verona summer has no such flower.

Nurse:
No, it's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

LADY CAPULET:
What you say? can you love this gentleman?
This night you will see him at our party;
Read the volume of young Paris's face,
And find pleasure written there with the pen of beauty;
Examine every married lineament,
And see how everyone lends content
And what is obscured in this beautiful volume lies
Find written in the depths of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify it, all that is missing is a cover:
The fish lives in the sea, and it is a great pride
For the fair without the interior fair to hide:
This book in the eyes of many shares the glory,
He in the golden clasps locks up the golden story;
Then you will share everything he has,
By having it, you are doing nothing less.

Nurse:
Not less! no, bigger; women grow thanks to men.

LADY CAPULET:
Speak briefly, can you love Paris love?

JULIET:
I will look like, if you want to move:
But I won't stick my eye deeper
May your consent give the strength to make it fly.

Servant:
Madam, the guests have arrived, supper is served, you
called, my lady asked, the nurse swore
the pantry and everything extreme. I have to
therefore wait; Please follow straight ahead.

LADY CAPULET:
We follow you.
Juliette, the county remains.

Nurse:
Go, my daughter, look for happy nights and happy days.

ROMEO:
What, will this speech be given for our apology?
Or will we continue without apologizing?

BENVOLIO:
The date comes out of such prolixity:
We won't have a deceived Cupid with a scarf,
Carrying the painted slat arch of a Tartar,
Scare the ladies like a guardian of crows;
Nor no prologue without book, spoke weakly
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they want;
We will measure them and leave.

ROMEO:
Give me a torch: I am not for this loitering;
Being only heavy, I will bear the light.

MERCUTIO:
No, kind Romeo, you must dance.

ROMEO:
Not me, believe me: you have dancing shoes
With agile soles: I have a soul of lead
So I'm pinned to the ground, I can't move.

MERCUTIO:
You are a lover ; borrows Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common limit.

ROMEO:
I was pierced too badly by his handle
To soar with its light feathers, and thus bound,
I cannot limit a tone above a sad misfortune:
Under the heavy burden of love, I sink.

MERCUTIO:
And to sink into it, we must burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

ROMEO:
Is love a tender thing? it is too hard,
Too rude, too loud, and it stings like a thorn.

MERCUTIO:
If love is hard on you, be hard on love;
Poke love for the sake of poking, and you beat love.
Give me a case to put my face in:
A visor for a visor! what does it matter to me
What curious eye cites deformities?
Here are the beetle's eyebrows that will blush for me.

BENVOLIO:
Come, knock and enter; and barely entered,
But everyone put him back on his feet.

ROMEO:
A torch for me: let the wanton have a light heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
Because I am proverbial with a grandfather phrase;
I will be a candle holder and I will watch.
The game has never been fairer, and I'm done.

MERCUTIO:
But, it's the mouse, it's the constable's own words:
If you're dun, we'll pull you out of the mud
Of this love of reverence, to which you hold
Up to the ears. Come, let's burn the day, ho!

ROMEO:
No, this is not the case.

MERCUTIO:
I mean, sir, late
We waste our lights in vain, like day lamps.
Take our good intention, for our judgment rests
Five times in there, before once in our five minds.

ROMEO:
And we have good intentions in opting for this mask;
But it's not a good idea to go there.

MERCUTIO:
Why, one may ask?

ROMEO:
I had a dream last night.

MERCUTIO:
And me too.

ROMEO:
Well, what was yours?

MERCUTIO:
That dreamers often lie.

ROMEO:
In bed, asleep, while they dream of real things.

MERCUTIO:
Oh, so I see Queen Mab was with you.
She is the midwife of the fairies and she comes
Shaped no bigger than an agate stone
On the index finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atoms
Through the noses of sleeping men;
Its chariot spokes made of long spider legs,
The covering of the grasshoppers' wings,
The traces of the smallest spider web,
The necklaces of the watery rays of moonlight,
His cricket bone whip, his film whip,
Its carter a little gray-haired gnat,
Not as big as a small roundworm
Stung by a servant's lazy finger;
His chariot is an empty nut
Made by the carpenter squirrel or the old worm,
Free time without thinking about the fairy bodybuilders.
And in this state, she gallops night after night
In the brains of lovers, and then they dream of love;
On the knees of the courtiers, who dream straight about the courtiers,
O'er the fingers of lawyers, who dream directly of fees,
O'er lips of ladies, who directly dream of kisses,
That often the angry Mab with plague blisters,
Because their breaths soiled with treats are:
Sometimes she gallops on a courtier's nose,
And then he dreams that he smells a suit;
And sometimes she comes with a tithe pigtail
Tickle a priest's nose while he sleeps,
Then he dreams of another benefit:
Sometimes it passes over a soldier's neck,
And then he dreams of slitting the throats of strangers,
Breaches, ambushes, Spanish blades,
Of a deep health of five fathoms; and then immediately
Drums in his ear, to which he jumps and wakes up,
And being so afraid, swear a prayer or two
And sleeps again. That's it Mab
Who raises the horses' manes at night,
And cooks the elves in filthy slut hairs,
Which once unraveled, many misfortunes bode:
It's the witch, when the maids lie on their backs,
This presses them and first teaches them to endure,
By making women of good behavior:
It's her--

ROMEO:
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
You don't talk about anything.

MERCUTIO:
It's true, I'm talking about dreams,
What are the children of an idle brain,
Spawned from nothing but vain fancies,
Who is as thin as air
And more fickle than the wind, which courts
Even now, the frozen bosom of the north,
And being angry, he went away from there,
Turning his face towards the south falling with dew.

BENVOLIO:
This wind, of which you speak, takes us away from ourselves;
Dinner is over and we will arrive too late.

ROMEO:
I fear it's too soon: for my mind is wandering
Consequences still hanging in the stars
Must bitterly begin his terrible tryst
With tonight's festivities and expire the term
Of a despised life locked in my bosom
By some ignoble abandonment of an untimely death.
But He, who directs my path,
Steer my sail! Come on, strong gentlemen.

BENVOLIO:
Strike, drum.

First Servant:
Where is Potpan, whom he helps not to take away? He
move a slicer? he scrapes a slicer!

Second servant:
When good manners all depend on one or two men
hands and they are not washed too, it is a filthy thing.

First Servant:
No more common stools, remove it
yard cupboard, look in the plate. Okay, save
me a piece of marchepane; and, as you love me, let
the doorman let Susan Grindstone and Nell in.
Antoine and Potpan!

Second servant:
Yes, boy, ready.

First Servant:
You are sought and called, asked and
wanted, in the large bedroom.

Second servant:
We can't be here and there too. Happy, boys; be
lively for a while, and the more the liver takes everything.

CAPULET:
Welcome gentlemen! ladies who have their toes
People without corns will have a fight with you.
Ah ha, my mistresses! which one of you
Will he now refuse to dance? she who makes you delicate,
She, I swear, has corns; do I come closer to you now?
Welcome gentlemen! I saw the day
That I wore a visor and I could tell
A story whispered in the ear of a beautiful lady,
As you wish: here we go, here we go, here we go:
You're welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A room, a room! leave some space! and put your foot down, girls.
No more light, rascals; and turn the situation around,
And turn off the heat, the room is getting too hot.
Ah, sir, this unexpected sport is coming along well.
No, sit down, no, sit down, good cousin Capulet;
For you and me, our dancing days are past:
How long has it been since the last time you and I
Were you masked?

Second Capulet:
By madame, thirty years old.

CAPULET:
What a man! it's not so much, it's not so much:
It is since Lucentio's wedding,
Come to Pentecost as quickly as possible,
About twenty-five years old; and then we masked ourselves.

Second Capulet:
It's more, it's more, his son is the eldest, sir;
His son is thirty years old.

CAPULET:
Do you want to tell me that?
His son was just a ward two years ago.

ROMEO:

Servant:
I do not know sir.

ROMEO:
Oh, she teaches the torches to shine brightly!
It seems as if she clings to the cheek of the night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiopian's ear;
Beauty is too rich to use, land is too expensive!
So shows a snowy dove in the company of crows,
As shown by this lady among her comrades.
Once the measurement is done, I will monitor his stand position,
And, touching his, bless my coarse hand.
Has my heart loved until now? give it up, view!
For I never saw true beauty until that night.

TYBALT:
This, from his voice, should be a Montague.
Go get me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
Come here, covered with an ancient face,
Flee and despise our solemnity?
Now, by the valor and honor of my parents,
Beating him to death, I don't consider it a sin.

CAPULET:
Well, how, my relative! why bother yourself like this?

TYBALT:
My uncle, here is a Montague, our enemy,
A villain who came despite everything,
To despise our solemnity this night.

CAPULET:
Is this young Romeo?

TYBALT:
It's him, that bad Romeo.

CAPULET:
Be content, sweet coz, leave him alone;
He wears it like a portly gentleman;
And truth be told, Verona brags about it
To be a virtuous and well-governed youth:
I wouldn't do it for the wealth of the whole city
Here, at my house, denigrate him:
So be patient, don't pay attention to him:
This is my will, and if you respect it,
Show beautiful presence and push away those frowns,
And an appearance unsuitable for a feast.

TYBALT:
It is appropriate, when such a villain is a guest:
I won't stand for it.

CAPULET:
It will be endured:
What, my good boy! I say, he must: go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You won't be able to stand it! God will repair my soul!
You will provoke a mutiny among my guests!
You're going to do cock-a-hoop! you will be the man!

TYBALT:
Well, uncle, that's a shame.

CAPULET:
Come on;
You are an impertinent boy: aren't you, indeed?
This tip may hurt you, I know what:
You must upset me! get married, it's time.
Well said, my hearts! You are a prince; go:
Be quiet, or... More light, more light! Damage !
I'm going to shut you up. What, cheerfully, my heart!

TYBALT:
Forced patience with a voluntary meeting of anger
Makes my flesh tremble in their different salvation.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion will not
What now seems sweet turns into bitter gall.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
Good pilgrim, you do too much harm to your hand,
What polite devotion shows in this;
For the saints have hands that the hands of pilgrims touch,
And palm to palm is the sacred kiss of the palm trees.

ROMEO:
Don't the saints have lips, and the holy palm trees too?

JULIET:
Yes, pilgrim, lips they must use in prayer.

ROMEO:
O then, dear saint, let the lips do what the hands do;
They pray, grant it, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIET:
The saints do not move, although they hear him for the sake of their prayers.

ROMEO:
So don't move, while I take the effect of my prayer.
So from my lips, through yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET:
So let my lips bear the sin they have committed.

ROMEO:
Has sin left your lips? O intrusion gently encouraged!
Give me back my sin again.

JULIET:
You kiss by the book.

Nurse:
Madam, your mother wants to talk to you.

ROMEO:
Who is his mother?

Nurse:
Get married, single,
His mother is the mistress of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
I fed his daughter, and you talked with her;
I tell you, he who can grasp it
Must have the slots.

ROMEO:
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is the debt of my enemy.

BENVOLIO:
Go, go; the sport is at the top.

ROMEO:
Yes, that's what I fear; the greater my worry.

CAPULET:
No, gentlemen, prepare yourself not to leave;
We have a senseless and meaningless banquet.
Is this really the case? why, then, I thank you all
I thank you, honest gentlemen; Good night.
No more torches here! Come on, let's go to bed.
Ah, sir, in my opinion, it's getting late:
I am going to rest.

JULIET:
Come here, nurse. What is this gentleman?

Nurse:
The son and heir of old Tiberio.

JULIET:
What's coming out now?

Nurse:
Get married, I think it will be young Petrucio.

JULIET:
Who is next there who wouldn't want to dance?

Nurse:
I don't know.

JULIET:
Go ask him his name: if he is married.
My grave is like my wedding bed.

Nurse:
Its name is Romeo and Montague;
The only son of your great enemy.

JULIET:
My only love is born from my only hatred!
Too soon seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love is for me,
That I must love a hated enemy.

Nurse:
What is this? What is this?

JULIET:
A rhyme I learned even now
From one I danced with.

Nurse:
Anon, anon!
Come, let's go; the foreigners are all gone.

Chorus:
Now the old desire lies on its deathbed,
And young affection is gaping to be his heir;
This fair for which love groaned and died,
With the tender Juliette, it is no longer fair.
Now Romeo is loved and still loves,
Also captivated by the charm of looks,
But he had to complain to his enemy,
And she steals the sweet bait of love from the fearful hooks:
Being considered an enemy, he cannot have access
Expressing the vows that lovers used to swear;
And she is as much in love, she matters much less
To meet your new loved one anywhere:
But passion gives them the power, time means, to meet
Temper the ends with extreme gentleness.

ROMEO:
Can I move forward when my heart is there?
Return, dull earth, and find your center.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

MERCUTIO:
He is wise ;
And, upon my lie, I took him home to bed.

BENVOLIO:
He ran this way and jumped this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.

MERCUTIO:
No, I will also conjure.
Romeo! moods! mad! passion! lover!
Appear in the form of a sigh:
Say just one rhyme and I'm satisfied;
Cry but “Yes, me!” pronounce only “love” and “dove”;
Say a fair word to my gossip Venus,
A nickname for his blind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, the one who shot so well,
When King Cophetua loved the beggar woman!
He doesn't listen, he doesn't move, he doesn't move;
The monkey is dead and I must ward it off.
I conjure you through the shining eyes of Rosaline,
By his high forehead and his scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, her right leg and her quivering thigh
And the domains adjacent to it are,
May you appear to us in your likeness!

BENVOLIO:
And if he hears you, you will make him angry.

MERCUTIO:
This cannot make him angry: it would make him angry
To elevate the spirit in the circle of his mistress
Of a strange nature, leave it there
Until she put it down and invoked it;
It was spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in the name of his mistress
I only conjure to relieve him.

BENVOLIO:
Come, he hid among these trees,
To accompany the humorous evening:
Blind is his love and is best suited to darkness.

MERCUTIO:
If love is blind, love cannot reach its target.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And I wish his mistress had this kind of fruit
As the maids call the medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she was, oh, that she was
An open et cetera, you a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night: I'm going to my trundle bed;
This camp bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come on, shall we go?

BENVOLIO:
Go ahead; because it is in vain
To seek him here is not to be found.

ROMEO:
He mocks the scars who never felt hurt.
But sweet ! what light through this window breaks?
It is the east and Juliet is the sun.
Rise up, beautiful sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That you, her servant, are much more beautiful than her:
Do not be her servant, since she is envious;
Its vestal livery is only sick and green
And only fools wear it; reject it.
This is my lady, oh, this is my love!
Oh, how she knew she was!
She speaks and she says nothing: what about?
His eyes speak; I will answer it.
I'm too bold, it's not me she's talking to:
Two of the most beautiful stars in the sky,
I have business, his eyes beg
To sparkle in their spheres until they return.
What if his eyes were there, in his head?
The shine of her cheek would put these stars to shame,
As daylight makes a lamp; his eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region flow such a brilliant stream
That the birds were singing and thinking it wasn't night.
See how she rests her cheek on her hand!
Oh, that I was a glove on this hand,
So I can touch that cheek!

JULIET:
Yes me!

ROMEO:
She speaks:
Oh, speak again, bright angel! because you are
As glorious as this night, being over my head
Just like a winged messenger from heaven
With white and amazed eyes
Mortals who fall back to look at him
When he steps over the lazy clouds
And sails through the air.

JULIET:
O Romeo, Romeo! why are you Romeo?
Deny your father and refuse your name;
Or, if you don't want it, swear to yourself, my love,
And I won't be a Capulet anymore.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
It is only your name that is my enemy;
You are yourself, but you are not a Montague.
What is Montague? it is neither a hand nor a foot,
Neither arms, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. Oh, be another name!
What's in a name? what we call a rose
By any other name it would smell just as good;
So would Romeo, if he were not called Romeo,
Preserve this dear perfection that he must
Without this title. Romeo, take away your name,
And for this name that is not part of you
Take it all myself.

ROMEO:
I take you at your word:
Call me but love, and I will be baptized again;
From now on I will never be Romeo again.

JULIET:
What man are you thus hidden in the night
So, are you stumbling upon my advice?

ROMEO:
By a name
I don't know how to tell you who I am:
My name, dear saint, is odious to me,
Because he is an enemy to you;
If I had written it, I would tear up the note.

JULIET:
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of the speech of this language, yet I know the sound:
Are you not Romeo and Montague?

ROMEO:
Neither, fair saint, if one or the other pleases you.

JULIET:
How did you come here, tell me, and why?
The orchard walls are high and difficult to climb,
And the place of death, considering who you are,
If one of my parents finds you here.

ROMEO:
With the light wings of love I flew over these walls;
For stony boundaries cannot hold love,
And what can love do that it dares to attempt?
This is why your parents are not allowed to me.

JULIET:
If they see you, they will kill you.

ROMEO:
Alas, there is more peril in your eyes
Than twenty of their swords: look at you but gentle,
And I am proof against their enmity.

JULIET:
I wouldn't want them to see you here for anything in the world.

ROMEO:
I have a night coat to hide me from their sight;
And but you love me, let them find me here:
My life would be better ended by their hatred,
That death has been postponed, for lack of your love.

JULIET:
Which way did you discover this place?

ROMEO:
By love, which first impelled me to inquire;
He lent me advice and I lent him eyes.
I am not a pilot; yet, were you that far away
Like this vast shore bathed by the most distant sea,
I would venture for such merchandise.

JULIET:
You know that the mask of the night is on my face,
Otherwise a girl would blush on my cheek
For what you heard me say tonight
I would like to dwell on the form, I would like, I would deny
What I said: but goodbye compliment!
Do you love me ? I know you'll say "Yes",
And I will take your word for it: but if you swear,
You can prove yourself wrong; to the perjury of lovers
Then say: Jupiter laughs. O sweet Romeo,
If you love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if you think I'm won too quickly,
I'll frown and be perverted and tell you no,
Then you will court; but otherwise, not for the world.
Truly, handsome Montague, I love too much,
And this is why you can think that my behavior is light:
But believe me, sir, I'll prove more true
Than those who have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been stranger, I must admit,
But you heard it, before I knew it,
The passion of my true love: forgive me then,
And do not attribute this surrender to light love,
That the dark night thus discovered.

ROMEO:
Madam, by this blessed moon, I swear
Who silver tips all these fruit tree tops...

JULIET:
Oh, don't swear by the moon, the fickle moon,
Than the monthly changes in its circled orb,
Lest your love also prove variable.

ROMEO:
What should I swear by?

JULIET:
Don't swear at all;
Or, if you wish, swear by your grace,
Who is the god of my idolatry,
And I will believe you.

ROMEO:
If my heart is my dear love...

JULIET:
Well, do not swear: although I rejoice in you,
I have no joy from this contract tonight:
It is too rash, too imprudent, too sudden;
Too similar to lightning that ceases to be
Before you can say, “It’s clearing up.” Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by the ripening breath of summer,
This could prove to be a beautiful flower the next time we meet.
Good night Good Night! like a sweet rest and rest
Come to your heart as to that of my chest!

ROMEO:
Oh, will you leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET:
What satisfaction can you have this evening?

ROMEO:
The exchange of your love's faithful wish for mine.

JULIET:
I gave you mine before you asked:
And yet I would love to give back.

ROMEO:
Would you like to remove it? for what purpose, my love?

JULIET:
But to be frank, and give it back to you.
And yet I wish, but for what I have:
My generosity is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give you,
The more I have, because both are infinite.
I hear a noise inside; dear love, farewell!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay a little longer, I'll come back.

ROMEO:
O blessed and blessed night! I am scared.
Being night, it's all a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

JULIET:
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night.
If your love is honorable,
Your wedding plan, send me a note tomorrow,
By him whom I will bring to you,
Where and at what time will you perform the rite;
And all my fortune at your feet, I will place it
And follow you my lord throughout the world.

Nurse:

JULIET:
I'm coming soon. But if you don't have good intentions,
I beg you...

Nurse:

JULIET:
Little by little, I arrive :--
To stop your trial and leave me to my sorrow:
Tomorrow I will send.

ROMEO:
So prosper my soul...

JULIET:
Good night a thousand times!

ROMEO:
A thousand times worse, wanting your light.
Love goes towards love, like schoolchildren
their books,
But love for love, towards school with heavy looks.

JULIET:
History! Romeo, hist! O, for the voice of a falconer,
To attract that sweetness of pompoms again!
Bondage is hoarse and cannot speak out loud;
Otherwise, I would tear apart the cave where Echo is,
And make his airy tongue hoarser than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

ROMEO:
It is my soul that calls upon my name:
As the tongues of lovers ring sweet and silvery at night,
Like the sweetest music for attentive ears!

JULIET:
Romeo!

ROMEO:
My dear?

JULIET:
At what time tomorrow
Should I send you?

ROMEO:
At nine o'clock.

JULIET:
I will not fail: there will be twenty years.
I forgot why I called you back.

ROMEO:
Let me stay here until you remember.

JULIET:
I will forget, so that you are always there,
I remember how much I love your company.

ROMEO:
And I will always stay, so that you forget again,
Forget any other house than this one.

JULIET:
It's almost morning; I would have made you leave:
And yet no further than a wanton bird;
Who lets it jump a little from his hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silken thread he takes it back,
So in love and jealous of his freedom.

ROMEO:
I would like to be your bird.

JULIET:
Sweet, me too:
Yet I should kill you with great dearness.
Good night Good Night! the separation is such
sweet sorrow,
That I will say good night to you until tomorrow.

ROMEO:
Sleep remains in your eyes, peace in your bosom!
Would I have sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
That's why I go to my ghostly father's cell,
Its help to desire, and my dear luck to tell.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
The gray-eyed morning smiles at the sullen night,
Tiles the oriental clouds with streaks of light,
And the dark dappled like a drunk spins
From the Path of the Fourth Day and the Fiery Wheels of Titan:
Now, before the sun sets forth its burning eye,
The day to rejoice and the wet dew of the night to dry,
I have to fill our wicker cage
With harmful weeds and flowers with precious juice.
The earth, mother of nature, is her tomb;
What is his grave, what is his womb,
And from her womb children of various kinds
We suck her natural tits discovery,
Much for many excellent virtues,
None but for some and yet all different.
O, Mickle is the mighty grace that resides
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
Because nothing so vile lives on earth
But to the earth some particular good gives,
Nor anything so good but constrained by this fair use
Revolts from the real birth, stubborn against abuse:
Virtue itself becomes vice, being poorly applied;
And vice sometimes through worthy action.
In the infantile bark of this little flower
The poison has the power of residence and medicine:
For this, being felt, with this part applauds each part;
Being tasted, kills all the senses with the heart.
Two kings so opposed always camp them
In man as in herbs, grace and gross will;
And where the worst prevails,
Soon the canker eats away at this plant.

ROMEO:
Hello, father.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Benedict!
What ancient language, so sweet, greets me?
Young son, that makes a sick head worth it
So, I wish you good morning in your bed soon:
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
And where worry resides, sleep will never reside;
But where an intact youth with an unstuffed brain
He lies down his limbs, there reigns a golden sleep:
This is why your precociousness assures me
You are awakened by some bad temperature;
Or if it doesn't, then I got it right,
Our Romeo didn't go to bed last night.

ROMEO:
This last point is true; the sweetest rest was for me.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
God forgives sin! were you with Rosaline?

ROMEO:
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No;
I forgot this name, and this name is a misfortune.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
He's my good son: but where have you been?

ROMEO:
I'll tell you before you ask me again.
I feasted with my enemy,
Where suddenly I was hurt,
It is by me injured: our two remedies
In your help and your holy physics are found:
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for behold,
My intercession also strengthens my enemy.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Be clear, good son, and simple in your conduct;
Enigmatic confessions, but enigmatic discoveries.

ROMEO:
So know clearly that the dear love of my heart is settled
On the beautiful daughter of the rich Capulet:
Like mine on his, so his is placed on mine;
And everything combined, except what you have to combine
Through holy matrimony: when, where and how
We met, we courted and exchanged vows,
I'll tell you in passing; but that's what I pray,
That you agree to marry us today.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Saint Francis, what a change here!
Did Rosaline, whom you loved so much,
So quickly abandoned? The love of young men lies then
Not really in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a briny affair
I washed your yellowed cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water is thrown into waste,
To season love, it has no taste!
The sun does not yet dissipate your sighs from the sky,
Your old moans still ring in my old ears;
Behold, here on your cheek the stain lies
From an old tear that is not yet washed:
If you were ever yourself and these misfortunes were yours,
You and these misfortunes were all for Rosaline:
And are you changed? then say this sentence,
Women can fall when men have no strength.

ROMEO:
You have often criticized me for loving Rosaline.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
To worship, not to love, raise mine.

ROMEO:
And it's bad for me to bury love.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Not in a grave,
To put one in, another to have.

ROMEO:
Please do not reprimand yourself; her that I love now
Do grace for grace's sake and love for love's sake permit it?
The other didn't.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
O, she knew well
Your love read by heart and didn't know how to spell.
But come, young waver, come, come with me,
In one respect, I will be your assistant;
For this alliance can so happily prove,
To transform the resentment in your home into pure love.

ROMEO:
O! let's go; I stand in sudden haste.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Wisely and slowly; they stumble and run quickly.

MERCUTIO:
Where the hell should this Romeo be?
Didn't he come home this evening?

BENVOLIO:
Not at his father's house; I spoke with her man.

MERCUTIO:
Ah, that same pale girl with a hard heart, that Rosaline.
Torments him so much that he will certainly go crazy.

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, kinsman of old Capulet,
Sent a letter to his father's house.

MERCUTIO:
A challenge, on my life.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo will answer it.

MERCUTIO:
Any man who knows how to write can respond to a letter.

BENVOLIO:
No, he will answer the master of the letter, how he
dare, be daring.

MERCUTIO:
Alas, poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
black eye of the white girl; shot in the ear with a
love song; the very pin of his heart split with the
the shaft of the boy with the blind bow: and is he a man to
meet Tybalt?

BENVOLIO:
Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCUTIO:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you that. Oh, he is
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights like
you sing spicy songs, you keep time, distance and
proportion; I rest my minimum rest, one, two, and
the third in your breast: the butcher of a silk
button, a duelist, a duelist; a gentleman from
very first house, of the first and second cause:
ah, the immortal past! the point reverso! THE
Hey!

BENVOLIO:
The what?

MERCUTIO:
The pox of such antiquity, lisping, affecting
fantastic; these new accent tuners! 'By Jesus,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Well, isn't it a lamentable thing,
grandfather, may we be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion merchants, these
Perdona-mi's, who stand so on the new form,
that they can't be comfortable on the old bench? Oh, their
bones, their bones!

BENVOLIO:
This is Romeo, this is Romeo.

MERCUTIO:
Without its eggs, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
how are you fished! Now it's him for the numbers
that Petrarch flocked: Laura for his lady was only a
kitchen maid; get married, she had a better love for
make him rhyme; Dido was poor; Cleopatra a gypsy;
Helen and Hero Hildings and Prostitutes; It's a gray
eye or other, but not to the point. Signor
Romeo, hello! there is a French greeting
to your French slope. You gave us the counterfeit
enough last night.

ROMEO:
Hello to both of you. What counterfeit have I given you?

MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, the hold; you can't conceive?

ROMEO:
Pardon me, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
in a case like mine, a man can be courteous.

MERCUTIO:
That is to say, a case like yours
forced a man to bow in the hams.

ROMEO:
That is to say at court.

MERCUTIO:
You hit him very nicely.

ROMEO:
A most courteous exhibition.

MERCUTIO:
No, I am the very pink of courtesy.

ROMEO:
Rose for flower.

MERCUTIO:
RIGHT.

ROMEO:
Well, then my pomp is indeed flowery.

MERCUTIO:
Well said: follow this joke now until you get it
your pump is worn out, only when the only sole of it
is carried, the joke can remain after the unique port in the singular.

ROMEO:
O joke with only one sole, unique only for the
single.

MERCUTIO:
Between us, good Benvolio; my mind fades.

ROMEO:
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

MERCUTIO:
No, if your mind goes on a wild goose chase, I have
done, because you have more wild goose in one of the
your spirit which, I am sure, I have in all of my five:
Was I with you there for the goose?

ROMEO:
You were never with me for anything when you were
not there for the goose.

MERCUTIO:
I'm going to bite your ear off for that joke.

ROMEO:
No, good goose, don't bite.

MERCUTIO:
Your spirit is a very bitter sweetness; It's a plus
hot sauce.

ROMEO:
And isn't it well served in a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO:
O, here is a spirit of Cheveril, which extends from a
narrow inch to a wide yardstick!

ROMEO:
I extend it for this word “broad”; who added
to the goose, you are by far a big goose.

MERCUTIO:
Why, isn't it better now than to moan with love?
now you are sociable, now you are Romeo; now the art
you what you are, by art as well as by nature:
because this talkative love is like a great natural,
who runs up and down to hide his trinket in a hole.

BENVOLIO:
Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO:
You want me to stop in my story against hair.

BENVOLIO:
Otherwise, you would have made a big story.

MERCUTIO:
Oh, you are deceived; I would have made it short:
because I had reached the full depth of my story; And
it was in fact a matter of no longer occupying the debate.

ROMEO:
This is some good stuff!

MERCUTIO:
A sail, a sail!

BENVOLIO:
Two two ; a shirt and a blouse.

Nurse:
Rock !

ROCK :
Anon!

Nurse:
My fan, Peter.

MERCUTIO:
Good Pierre, to hide his face; for his fan, it's the
fairer face.

Nurse:
Good God, hello, gentlemen.

MERCUTIO:
God, good den, beautiful lady.

Nurse:
Is this a good den?

MERCUTIO:
It is no less, I tell you, for the profligate hand of
The dial is now at noon.

Nurse:
To you ! what a man are you!

ROMEO:
One, lady, that God made for himself
mar.

Nurse:
On my word, that is well said; 'for himself to spoil,'
said a'? Gentlemen, can one of you tell me where I
will he be able to find young Romeo?

ROMEO:
I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
you found it more than it was when you were looking for it:
I'm the youngest of that name, for lack of anything worse.

Nurse:
You say well.

MERCUTIO:
Yeah, is the worst good? very well taken, my word;
wisely, wisely.

Nurse:
if it is you, sir, I wish to have a little confidence with
You.

BENVOLIO:
She will invite him to dinner.

MERCUTIO:
A whore, a whore, a whore! so ho!

ROMEO:
What did you find?

MERCUTIO:
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a Lenten pie,
it is something stale and old before it is spent.
An old frost hare,
And an old hare frost,
Is meat very good in Lent
But a hoarse hare
It's too much for a score,
When he becomes hoarse before being exhausted.
Romeo, are you coming to your father's house? GOOD
dinner there.

ROMEO:
I will follow you.

MERCUTIO:
Farewell, old lady; farewell,
'lady, madam, madam.'

Nurse:
Get married, goodbye! Please, sir, what impertinence
Was it this merchant who was so full of his ropes?

ROMEO:
A gentleman, a nurse, who likes to hear himself speak,
and will talk more in a minute than he can stand
in a month.

Nurse:
If you say anything against me, I'll take it
down, and a' were more vigorous than him, and twenty of them
Takes; and if I can't, I'll find those who will.
Scurvy rascal! I'm none of his flirtatious gills; I am
none of his fellow Skins. And you have to stay there
also, and allow every rascal to use me as he pleases?

ROCK :
I have not seen any man use you with pleasure; if I had done it, my weapon
I should have gone out quickly, I guarantee it: I dare
draw as soon as another man, if I see the opportunity in a
good quarrel, and the law on my side.

Nurse:
Now, before God, I'm so upset that everything about me
I shudder. Scurvy rascal! Please, sir, a word:
and as I told you, my young lady asked me to inform you
out; what she told me to say, I will keep to myself:
but let me tell you first, if you have to drive her in
a fool's paradise, as they say, it was a very disgusting place
kind of behavior, as they say: for the nice lady
is young; and, therefore, if you had to do double
with her, it was really a bad thing to be proposed to her
to any nice woman, and very weak behavior.

ROMEO:
Nurse, recommend me to your lady and your mistress. I
protest against you...

Nurse:
Good heart, and, my faith, I will tell him:
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

ROMEO:
What are you going to tell him, nurse? you don't mark me.

Nurse:
I will tell him, sir, that you protest; who, like
I suppose that's an offer worthy of a gentleman.

ROMEO:
Give him a plan
Some ways to get by this afternoon;
And there she will be in Brother Laurence's cell
Be shriveled and married. Here is for your pain.

Nurse:
No really sir; not a cent.

ROMEO:
Go to; I say you will.

Nurse:
This afternoon, sir? well, she will be there.

ROMEO:
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
In this hour my man will be with you
And bring you ropes made like a veneered staircase;
Which to the highest gallant of my joy
This must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be faithful, and I will cease your sorrows:
Farewell; recommend me to your mistress.

Nurse:
Now, God in heaven bless you! Listen, sir.

ROMEO:
What do you say, my dear nurse?

Nurse:
Is your man secret? Have you never heard,
Can two keep counsel, putting one aside?

ROMEO:
I guarantee you, my man is as faithful as steel.

NURSE:
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
Lord! when it was a little chatter :--O, there
is a nobleman from the city, a certain Paris, who would like
place the knife on board; but she, good soul, had for faith
to see a toad, a very toad, like to see it. I make her angry
sometimes and tell him Paris is the right place
man; but, I guarantee you, when I say it, she looks
as pale as any influence in the versatile world. Is not it
Both Rosemary and Romeo start with a letter?

ROMEO:
Yes, nurse; what about that? both with an R.

Nurse:
Oh. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
the no; I know it starts with another
letter: - and it has the prettiest
that, from you and rosemary, that it would do you good
to hear it.

ROMEO:
Recommend me to your lady.

Nurse:
Yes, a thousand times.
Rock !

ROCK :
Anon!

Nurse:
Peter, take my fan and go ahead and quickly.

JULIET:
The clock struck nine when I sent the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to come back.
Maybe she can't meet him: that's not the case.
Oh, she's lame! the heralds of love should be thoughts,
Which slide ten times faster than the rays of the sun,
Pushing back the shadows on the sinister hills:
This is why doves with agile wings attract love,
This is why Cupid's wings, swift in the wind.
The sun is now on the highest hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine to noon
It's been three long hours and yet she hasn't come.
If she had affection and warm, youthful blood,
It would move as quickly as a bullet;
My words would attach him to my sweet love,
And his for me:
But many old people pretend to be dead;
Cumbersome, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she is coming!
Oh dear nurse, what news?
Have you met him? Fire your man.

Nurse:
Peter, stay at the door.

JULIET:
Now, good and gentle nurse, O Lord, why do you look sad?
Even if the news is sad, tell them joyfully;
If it's good, you put sweet news music to shame
Playing it to me with such a sour face.

Nurse:
I'm tired, give me a moment:
Fi, how my bones hurt! what a getaway I had!

JULIET:
I would like you to have my bones, and me your news:
No, come, please, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

Nurse:
Jesus, what hurry? can't you stay a while?
Can't you see I'm out of breath?

JULIET:
How are you out of breath, when you have breath
To tell me you're out of breath?
The excuse you make for this delay
Is longer than the story you excuse.
Is your news good or bad? answer that;
Say one or the other, and I will stick to the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, isn't it good or bad?

Nurse:
Well, you've made a simple choice; you do not know
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not him; although its
the face is better than any man's, but his leg excels
all the men; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
even if we shouldn't talk about it, they are nonetheless
past comparison: he is not the flower of courtesy,
but, I guarantee, he is as gentle as a lamb. Go your
manners, girl; serve God. What, did you have dinner at home?

JULIET:
No, no: but I knew all this before.
What does he say about our marriage? what about that?

Nurse:
Lord, how my head hurts! what a face I have!
It beats like it would fall into twenty pieces.
My back on the other side, oh my back, my back!
Tear your heart for sending me everywhere,
To catch my death by making escapades up and down!

JULIET:
Well, I'm sorry you're not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what does my love say?

Nurse:
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
courteous, kind and handsome, and I
proxy, a virtuous one, — Where is your mother?

JULIET:
Where is my mother! well, she's inside;
Where should she be? How strangely you answer!
"Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is your mother?'

Nurse:
O dear lady of God!
Are you so sexy? get married, go up, I think;
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Now make your messages yourself.

JULIET:
Here is such a reel! Come, what does Romeo say?

Nurse:
Do you have permission to leave today?

JULIET:
I have.

Nurse:
Then go to Brother Laurence’s cell;
There remains a husband to make you a wife:
Now comes the wanton blood that rises to your cheeks,
They will immediately be in scarlet at the slightest news.
Hello to the church; I must in another way,
To seek a ladder by which your love
Must climb on a bird's nest as soon as it gets dark:
I am the drudgery and the work for your pleasure,
But you will bear the burden soon into the night.
Go; I'm going to dinner: I'll greet you in the cell.

JULIET:
Hail to the great fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
So smile to heaven on this holy act,
So that after hours, sorrow does not scold us!

ROMEO:
Amen, amen! but whatever the sorrow,
It cannot thwart the exchange of joy
This short minute gives me in his eyes:
Close our hands with holy words,
Then death, devouring love, does what it dares;
I just need to call it mine.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Who by kissing consume: the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own delights
And in taste confuses the appetite:
So love moderately; long love does it;
Too fast comes as late as too slow.
Here is the lady: O, such a light foot
Will never wear out the eternal flint:
A lover can ride the talker
Which turns in slow motion in the wanton air of summer,
And yet do not fall; therefore light is vanity.

JULIET:
This is good even for my ghostly confessor.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Romeo will thank you, my daughter, for both of us.

JULIET:
So much for him, otherwise it's too much for his thanks.

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliette, if the measure of your joy
Be like mine and let your skills be more
To emblazon it, then soften with your breath
This neighbor looks and leaves the music language rich
Develop the imagined happiness that both
Receive yourself through this dear meeting.

JULIET:
Vanity, richer in matter than in words,
Boasts of its substance, not of its ornament:
They are only beggars who can count their worth;
But my true love has reached such excess
I can't sum up half of my wealth.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Come, come with me, and we will make short work of it;
Because, by your leaves, you will not remain alone
Until the holy church incorporated two into one.

BENVOLIO:
I pray you, good Mercutio, let us withdraw:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And if we meet, we will not escape the fight;
For now, on these hot days, it's crazy blood that's boiling.

MERCUTIO:
You're like one of those guys who, when he
walks into a tavern and hits me with his sword
on the table and said "God send me no need
you!' and by the operation of the second cup pulls
on the drawer, when in fact it is not necessary.

BENVOLIO:
Am I like such a guy?

MERCUTIO:
Come, come, you're a Jack as hot in your mood as
anyone in Italy, and immediately moved to be sullen, and like
soon in a changeable mood.

BENVOLIO:
And what ?

MERCUTIO:
No, if there were two, we shouldn't have any
soon, because one would kill the other. You! Why,
you will argue with a man who is a hair taller,
or one hair less in his beard than you have: you
I will argue with a man for cracking nuts, without having
other reason than because you have hazel eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy on such a quarrel?
Your head is as amusing with quarrels as an egg is full of them.
meat, and yet your head was beaten too
an egg for a quarrel: you quarreled with an
man for coughing in the street, because he
Wake up your dog who was sleeping in the sun:
Didn't you have a falling out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
tie your new shoes with an old ribbon? and yet you
you will stop me from arguing!

BENVOLIO:
And I was so prone to quarrel like you, any man
I should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

MERCUTIO:
Fee simple! O simple!

BENVOLIO:
Near my head, here are the Capulets.

MERCUTIO:
By my heel, I don't care.

TYBALT:
Follow me closely, because I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.

MERCUTIO:
And would it be just a word with one of us? pair it with
something; make it a word and a go.

TYBALT:
You will find me quite suitable for this, sir, and you
that will give me the opportunity.

MERCUTIO:
Couldn't you take advantage of an opportunity without giving?

TYBALT:
Mercutio, you are in a relationship with Romeo,

MERCUTIO:
Marry! What, are you making us minstrels? A
you make us minstrels, look only to hear
discords: here is my violin; that's it, it should
make you dance. “Zounds, consort!”

BENVOLIO:
We speak here in the public den of men:
Either you retire to a private place,
And reason coldly about your grievances,
Or leave; here all eyes are on us.

MERCUTIO:
Men's eyes are made to look and let them look;
I won't move for anyone's sake.

TYBALT:
Well, peace be with you, sir: here is my man.

MERCUTIO:
But I will be hanged, sir, if he wears your livery:
Get married, go before going to the fields, he will be your disciple;
Your cult, in this sense, can call him “man.”

TYBALT:
Romeo, the hatred I bear for you can be allowed
No better term than this: you are a bad guy.

ROMEO:
Tybalt, the reason why I must love you
Does that much excuse the corresponding rage
To such a greeting: I am not a villain;
Farewell then; I see you don't know me.

TYBALT:
Boy, that won't excuse the injuries
What you did to me; so turn around and draw.

ROMEO:
I protest, I never hurt you,
But loves you better than you can imagine,
Until you know the reason for my love:
And so, good Capulet, what name I propose
As expensive as mine, be satisfied.

MERCUTIO:
O calm, dishonorable and vile submission!
Alla stoccata wins.
Tybalt, you rat catcher, will you walk?

TYBALT:
What do you want with me?

MERCUTIO:
Good king of cats, just one of your nine
lives; that I want to be bold, and like you
will use me later, dry beat the rest of the
eight. Do you want to tear your sword from its pitcher
through the ears? hurry, lest mine concern your
ears before it came out.

TYBALT:
I'm yours.

ROMEO:
Sweet Mercutio, raise your rapier.

MERCUTIO:
Come, sir, your passado.

ROMEO:
Draw, Benvolio; bring down their weapons.
Gentlemen, out of shame, refrain from this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly
Bandi banned in the streets of Verona:
Wait, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

MERCUTIO:
I am hurt.
A scourge for both your homes! I am accelerated.
Did he leave and have nothing?

BENVOLIO:
What, are you hurt?

MERCUTIO:
Yes, yes, a scratch, a scratch; getting married is enough.
Where is my page? Go, you bad guy, get a surgeon.

ROMEO:
Courage, man; the evil cannot be great.

MERCUTIO:
No, it's not as deep as a well, nor as wide as a well.
church door; but that's enough, it will be useful: ask
me tomorrow, and you will find me a serious man. I
I'm excited, I guarantee it, for this world. A plague o'
your two houses! "Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
thug, a bad guy, who fights according to the book of
arithmetic! Why the hell did you come between us? I
was injured under the arm.

ROMEO:
I thought everything was for the best.

MERCUTIO:
Help me enter a house, Benvolio,
Or I'll pass out. A scourge for both your homes!
They made me into worm meat: I have it,
And solidly too: your homes!

ROMEO:
This gentleman, close ally of the prince,
My very friend was fatally injured
In my name ; my reputation damaged
With Tybalt's slander, Tybalt, it's been an hour
He's my relative! O sweet Juliet,
Your beauty made me effeminate
And in my character the steel of valor has softened!

BENVOLIO:
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!
This valiant spirit has sucked up the clouds,
Which, too inopportune, has here despised the earth.

ROMEO:
The black fate of this day will depend on other days;
This is just the beginning of the misfortune, others must end.

BENVOLIO:
Here is the return of the furious Tybalt.

ROMEO:
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio killed!
In paradise, respective clemency,
And my fiery-eyed fury be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, rebuke the wicked,
This deadline you gave me; for the soul of Mercutio
Is only a little above our heads,
Staying for you to keep him company:
Either you or I or both must accompany him.

TYBALT:
You, miserable boy, who frequented him here,
I will be with him from now on.

ROMEO:
This will determine that.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo, go away, go away!
The citizens are standing and Tybalt killed.
Do not be surprised: the prince will condemn you to death,
If you are caught: leave, go away!

ROMEO:
Oh, I'm crazy about fortune!

BENVOLIO:
Why do you stay?

First citizen:
Which way did he who killed Mercutio run?
Tybalt, this murderer, where did he run?

BENVOLIO:
This is where Tybalt rests.

First citizen:
Get up, sir, follow me;
I order you in the name of the prince, obey.

PRINCE:
Where are the ugly newbies in this fray?

BENVOLIO:
O noble prince, I can discover everything
The unfortunate outcome of this fatal fight:
There lies the man, killed by young Romeo,
This is what killed your relative, brave Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET:
Tybalt, my cousin! O child of my brother!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, blood is shed
O my dear parent! Prince, how true you are,
For our blood, shed the blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!

PRINCE:
Benvolio, who started this bloody melee?

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, here slain, whom the hand of Romeo slew;
Romeo who spoke to him honestly asked him to think
How pleasant the quarrel was and insisted at the same time
Your great dissatisfaction: all that said
With gentle breathing, calm gaze, humbly bent knees,
I couldn't make a truce with the unruly rat
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but he leans
With steel piercing Mercutio's bold chest,
Which just as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with martial contempt, with one hand beats
Cold death apart, and with the others sends
This goes to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retort him: Romeo he cries out loud,
“Wait, my friends! friends, go! and, faster than
his language,
His agile arm strikes down their fatal points,
And between them rushes; under whose arm
An envious blow from Tybalt struck life
The robust Mercutio, then Tybalt fled;
But little by little comes back to Romeo,
Who had just taken revenge,
And they go there like lightning, because, before I
Could separate them, big Tybalt was killed.
And as he fell, Romeo turned and flew away.
It's the truth, or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET:
He is a relative of the Montagues;
Affection makes it false; he is not telling the truth:
About twenty of them fought in this black struggle,
And these twenty people could only take one life.
I demand justice, which you, prince, must render;
Romeo killed Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

PRINCE:
Romeo killed him, he killed Mercutio;
Who now owes the price of his dear blood?

ASSEMBLY :
It was not Romeo, prince, it was Mercutio's friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The Life of Tybalt.

PRINCE:
And for this offense
We immediately exile him:
I'm interested in continuing your hatred,
My blood for your harsh fights bleeds;
But I'm going to fine you so hard
That you will all repent for the loss of mine:
I will be deaf to supplications and excuses;
Neither tears nor prayers will redeem abuse:
So do not use it: let Romeo go with all haste,
Otherwise, when he is found, that hour is his last.
So carry this body and be attentive to our will:
Mercy but murders, forgiveness to those who kill.

JULIET:
Gallop at full speed, steeds with fiery feet,
Towards the lodging of Phoebus: like a carter
As Phaeton would whip you westward,
And immediately bring a cloudy night.
Extend your narrow curtain, night of love,
This fugitive's eyes can blink and Romeo
Jump towards these arms, which we do not talk about and which we do not see.
Lovers can see their love rites performed
By their own beauties; or, if love is blind,
It goes better with nighttime. Come, civil night,
You, matron in a sober costume, all in black,
And teach me how to lose a winning game,
Played for a pair of stainless virginities:
Captures my unmanned blood, burning my cheeks,
With your black coat; until a strange love, grown bold,
Consider that true love acted out of simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, day and night;
For you will lie down on the wings of the night
Whiter than fresh snow on a crow's back.
Come, sweet night, come, loving black-browed night,
Give me my Romeo; and when he dies,
Take it and cut it into little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so beautiful
That the whole world will be in love with the night
And pay no worship to the blaring sun.
O, I bought a love's mansion,
But I didn't own it, and although I was sold,
Not yet enjoyed: this day is so tedious
As is the case the day before a festival
To an impatient child who has new dresses
And I can't wear them. Oh, here is my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But the name Romeo speaks with heavenly eloquence.
Now, nurse, what news? What do you have there? the cords
What did Romeo ask you to get?

Nurse:
Yes, yes, the ropes.

JULIET:
Yes me! What's new? why are you wringing your hands?

Nurse:
Ah, well, one day! he is dead, he is dead, he is dead!
We are lost, madam, we are lost!
Alas, what a day! he's gone, he's killed, he's dead!

JULIET:
Can heaven be so envious?

Nurse:
Romeo can,
Although heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Who would have ever thought it? Romeo!

JULIET:
What devil are you to torment me like this?
This torture should be roared in a gloomy hell.
Did Romeo commit suicide? say that you are "I",
And this bare vowel "I" will poison even more
That the deadly eye of the cockatrice:
I am not I, if there is such a I;
Or those closed eyes that make you answer “I”.
If he is killed, say “I”; or otherwise no:
Brief sounds determine my happiness or unhappiness.

Nurse:
I saw the wound, I saw it with my eyes,--
God keep the mark! – here on his virile chest:
A pitiful corpse, a pitiful and bloody corpse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bathed in blood,
All in bloody blood; I was stunned at this sight.

JULIET:
Oh, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, get out of there right now!
In prison, eyes, never look at freedom!
Vile earth, to earth resigns; end the movement here;
And you and Romeo squeeze a heavy beer!

Nurse:
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I ever had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest sir!
That I would never live to see you dead!

JULIET:
What is this storm that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slain and Tybalt dead?
My beloved cousin and my dear lord?
So, terrible trumpet, sound the general catastrophe!
Because who will live if these two are gone?

Nurse:
Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished;
Romeo who killed him, he is banished.

JULIET:
Oh my God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

Nurse:
It happened, it happened; alas the day, it happened!

JULIET:
O serpent's heart, hidden under a flowery face!
Has a dragon ever guarded such a beautiful cave?
Magnificent tyrant! angelic demon!
Crow with dove feathers! a ravenous lamb of wolves!
Despised substance of the most divine spectacle!
Just the opposite of what you rightly seem,
A cursed saint, an honorable villain!
O nature, what did you have to do in hell,
When you slayed the spirit of a demon
In the moral paradise of such soft flesh?
Has there ever been a book containing such vile things
So related enough? Where this deception should dwell
In such a magnificent palace!

Nurse:
There is no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjurers,
All perjurers, all worthless, all dissemblers.
Ah, where is my man? give me aqua vitae:
These sorrows, these misfortunes, these sorrows age me.
Shame on Romeo!

JULIET:
A light bulb would be your tongue
For such a wish! he was not born in shame:
On his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For it is a throne where honor can be crowned
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
what a beast was I to scold him!

Nurse:
Do you want to say good things about the one who killed your cousin?

JULIET:
Should I speak ill of my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what language will sweeten your name,
When I, your wife of three hours, mutilated him?
But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin?
This evil cousin would have killed my husband:
Return, wild tears, return to your native source;
Your flowing drops belong to misfortune,
Which you, by mistake, offer to joy.
My husband is alive, the one whom Tybalt would have killed;
And Tybalt is dead, that would have killed my husband:
All this is only comfort; why cry then?
There was a word, worse than Tybalt's death,
It murdered me: I would like to forget it;
But, oh, it comes to my memory,
As cursed and sinful acts for the minds of sinners:
“Tybalt is dead, and Romeo… banished; »
This “banished”, this single word “banished”,
Killed ten thousand Tybalts. The death of Tybalt
It was bad enough if everything had stopped there:
Or, if bitter woe rejoices in companionship
And it will necessarily be classed among other sorrows,
Why didn't she follow him, when she said "Tybalt is dead",
Your father, or your mother, no, or both,
What modern laments could have moved?
But with a rearguard after Tybalt's death,
"Romeo is banished", to pronounce this word,
Did the father, the mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All killed, all dead. “Romeo is banished!”
There is no end, no limit, no measure, no limit,
In the death of this word; no words can express this misfortune.
Where are my father and my mother, nurse?

Nurse:
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corpse:
Will you go to them? I will take you there.

JULIET:
They wash his wounds with tears: mine will be spent,
When theirs are dry, for the banishment of Romeo.
Take back these strings: poor strings, you are deceived,
You and me ; because Romeo is exiled:
He has prepared you for a road leading to my bed;
But I, a servant, die a widow.
Come, ropes, come, nurse; I am going to my wedding bed;
And death, not Romeo, take my virginity!

Nurse:
Hello in your room: I will find Romeo
To console you: I know where he is.
Listen, your Romeo will be there at night:
I go to him; he is hidden in Laurence's cell.

JULIET:
Oh, find it! give this ring to my true knight,
And tell him to come and say his last goodbyes.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Romeo, come out; come out, fearful man:
Affliction is in love with your parts,
And you are married to calamity.

ROMEO:
Father, what news? what is the destiny of the prince?
What sadness needs knowledge from me,
What I don't know yet?

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Too familiar
Is my dear son in such bad company:
I bring you the news of the prince's fate.

ROMEO:
What's less than the day the world ends for the prince?

BROTHER LAURENCE:
A gentler judgment disappeared from his lips,
Not the death of the body, but the banishment of the body.

ROMEO:
Ha, banishment! be merciful, say “death”;
For exile has more terror in its eyes,
Much more than death: don’t say “banishment”.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
This is why you are banished from Verona:
Be patient, because the world is big and wide.

ROMEO:
There is no world without the walls of Verona,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Therefore the outcast is banished from the world,
And exile from the world is death: then banished,
Is death misinterpreted: calling death banishment,
You cut off my head with a golden ax,
And I smile at the blow that kills me.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
O mortal sin! O gross ingratitude!
Your fault, our law calls for death; but the kind prince,
By taking your side, you set aside the law,
And I transformed this black word, death, into banishment:
It's a dear mercy, and you don't see it.

ROMEO:
It is torture and not pity: paradise is here,
Where Juliette lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, everything unworthy,
Live here in heaven and be able to contemplate it;
But Romeo cannot: no more validity,
A more honorable state, more court lives
In the carrion that Romeo: they are mine
On the white wonder of my dear Juliette's hand
And steal the immortal blessing from his lips,
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Always blush, as if you thought their own kisses were a sin;
But this may not be the case with Romeo; he is banned:
Flies can do this, but I have to fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And do you still say that exile is not death?
Did you not mix poison, nor a sharp knife,
No sudden death, although never so bad,
But “banished” to kill me? – “banned”?
O brother, the damned use this word in hell;
Howls accompany it: how is your heart,
Being a divine and ghostly confessor,
An absolute of sins, and my friend declared,
Mutilate myself with this word “banished”?

BROTHER LAURENCE:
You like the crazy, listen to me but say a word.

ROMEO:
Oh, you'll talk about banishment again.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
I will give you armor to avoid this word:
The sweet milk of adversity, philosophy,
To comfort you, even if you are banished.

ROMEO:
Yet “banned”? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Move a city, reverse the destiny of a prince,
This doesn't help, it doesn't prevail: don't speak any more.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Oh, then I see that fools have no ears.

ROMEO:
How should they do it, when the wise have no eyes?

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Let me argue with you about your domain.

ROMEO:
You can't talk about what you don't feel:
Were you as young as me, Juliette your love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Loving like me and banished like me,
Then you could talk, then you could tear your hair out,
And fall to the ground, like I do now,
Take the measurement of an undug grave.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Arise; someone knocked ; good Romeo, hide yourself.

ROMEO:
Not me ; unless the breath of the sick heart groans,
Like a mist, envelops me in the search of eyes.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Listen, how they strike! Who is here? Romeo, get up;
You will be caught. Stay a little! Get up;
Run to my office. Gradually ! God's will,
What simplicity! I'm coming, I'm coming!
Who hits so hard? where do you come from ? what is your will?

Nurse:

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Welcome, then.

Nurse:
O holy brother, oh, tell me, holy brother,
Where is my lady's lord, where is Romeo?

BROTHER LAURENCE:
There, on the ground, with her own drunken tears.

Nurse:
Oh, it is even in the case of my mistress,
Just in his case! O awful sympathy!
Pitiful situation! Even so, she lies,
cry and cry, cry and cry.
Get up, get up; get up and be a man:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, get up and stand up;
Why should you fall into such a deep O?

ROMEO:
Nurse!

Nurse:
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death is the end of everything.

ROMEO:
Did you talk about Juliette? how are you with her?
Doesn't she consider me an old murderer,
Now I have sullied the childhood of our joy
With little blood removed from his?
Where is she? and how is she? and what does it say
My lady hidden from our canceled love?

Nurse:
Oh ! she says nothing, sir, but she cries and cries;
And now she falls on her bed; then starts,
And Tybalt calls; and then Romeo cries,
And then it falls again.

ROMEO:
As if this name,
Shot from the lethal level of a gun,
I murdered her; like the cursed hand of this name
She murdered her relative. Oh, tell me, brother, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Does my name remain? tell me, so I can lay off
The hateful mansion.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Hold your desperate hand:
Are you a man? your form screams you are:
Your tears are feminine; your wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
An unseemly woman in a man who seems!
Or an unhealthy beast appearing to be both!
You amazed me: by my holy order,
I thought your character was more temperate.
Did you kill Tybalt? Do you want to kill yourself?
And also remain your lady who lives in you,
By making you really hate it?
Why do you insult your birth, heaven and earth?
Since birth, heaven and earth, all three meet
In you at the same time; that you would like to lose immediately.
Fi, fi, you shame your form, your love, your spirit;
Who, like a usurer, abounds in all,
And use none in this true use
Who should adorn your form, your love, your spirit:
Your noble form is only a form of wax,
Moving away from the value of a man;
Your dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Kill this love you swore to cherish;
Your spirit, this ornament to shape and love,
Deformed in the conduct of both,
Like powder in the flask of a soldier without skill,
Is inflamed by your own ignorance,
And you were dismembered in your own defense.
What, wake up, man! your Juliette is alive,
For whose love you had recently died;
You are happy there: Tybalt would kill you,
But you killed Tybalt; there you are happy too:
The law that threatened death becomes your friend
And transforms him into exile; there you are happy:
A bundle of blessings lights up on your back;
Happiness woos you in its most beautiful finery;
But, like an ill-bred and sullen girl,
You pout about your fortune and your love:
Be careful, be careful, because these people die miserable.
Go, go to your love, as it was decreed,
Go up to her room and comfort her:
But look, don't stay until the watch is set,
Because then you cannot go to Mantua;
Where you will live, until we can find a time
To ignite your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Ask the prince for forgiveness and remember
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
So you went out wailing.
Go ahead, nurse: recommend me to your lady;
And tell him to hurry the whole house to bed,
To what heavy sadness makes them apt:
Romeo arrives.

Nurse:
O Lord, I could have stayed here all night
To hear good advice: O, what is learning!
Monsignor, I will tell my lady that you will come.

ROMEO:
Do it, and ask my sweetheart to prepare to scold you.

Nurse:
Here, sir, is a ring that she asked me to give you, sir:
Hey, hurry up because it's getting really late.

ROMEO:
How this revives my comfort!

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Go; Good night; and here is your entire state:
Either you leave before the watch is set,
Or at dawn, disguised from here:
Stay in Mantua; I'm going to discover your man,
And it will mean from time to time
All the good fortunes that come your way here:
Give me your hand ; it's late: goodbye; Good night.

ROMEO:
But let a past joy call me,
It was such a brief sorrow to part with you: Farewell.

CAPULET:
Things went wrong, sir, so unfortunately,
That we didn't have time to move our daughter:
Look, she loved her kinsman Tybalt very much,
And me too:--Well, we were born to die.
It's very late, she won't come down this evening:
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been in bed an hour ago.

PARIS:
These times of misfortune leave us no time to woo.
Madam, good evening: recommend me to your daughter.

LADY CAPULET:
I will do it, and I will know his opinion early tomorrow;
Tonight, she is meowed to the point of heaviness.

CAPULET:
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate offer
From the love of my child: I think she will be governed
In all respects by me; much more, I have no doubt.
Woman, go to her before you go to bed;
Let him know here the love of my son Paris;
And tell him, notice me, next Wednesday...
But sweet ! what day is it ?

PARIS:
Monday, my lord,

CAPULET:
Monday! ah, ah! Well, Wednesday is too early,
O Thursday, let it be: O Thursday, tell him,
She will be married to this noble count.
Will you be ready? do you like this rush?
We won't keep much noise, a friend or two;
For, hear ye, Tybalt being slain so late,
You would think we held it carelessly,
Being our parent, if we delight greatly:
So we will have half a dozen friends,
And there, an end. But what do you say about Thursday?

PARIS:
Monsignor, I would like Thursday to be tomorrow.

CAPULET:
Well, off you go: let it be Thursday, then.
Go see Juliette before you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, for this wedding day.
Farewell, my lord. Light in my room, ho!
In front of me ! it's so very late,
So we can call him early every now and then.
Good night.

JULIET:
Do you want to leave? it is not yet close to the day:
It was the nightingale, not the lark,
It pierced the fearful hollow of your ear;
Every evening, she sings on your pomegranate tree:
Believe me, my love, it was the nightingale.

ROMEO:
It was the lark, the herald of the morning,
No nightingale: look, my love, what desires
Lace the parting clouds yonder in the east:
The candles of the night are extinguished and the day is merry
Stands on tiptoe on misty mountain peaks.
I must go and live, or stay and die.

JULIET:
This light is not that of day, I know it, I:
It is a meteor that the sun exhales,
Be a torchbearer for you this night,
And enlighten yourself on the way to Mantua:
So stay still; you don't need to leave.

ROMEO:
Let me be taken, let me be put to death;
I'm happy, so you want it that way.
I will say that your gray is not the eye of the morning,
It is only the pale reflection of Cynthia's forehead;
Nor is it the lark whose notes beat
The celestial vault so high above our heads:
I have more worries about staying than wanting to leave:
Come, death, and welcome! Juliette wants it that way.
How is it, my soul? let's talk; it's not daylight.

JULIET:
It's, it's: hey, go away, go away!
It's the lark that sings so out of tune,
Harsh discords and unpleasant sharp objects.
Some say that the lark makes gentle divisions;
This is not the case, because it divides us:
Some say that the lark and the hated toad change their eyes,
Oh, now I wish they had changed their voices too!
Since arm after arm this voice has fought us,
So I hunt you with the day by day hunt,
Oh, now go away; more light and light it grows.

ROMEO:
More light and light; our misfortunes become darker and darker!

Nurse:
Madam!

JULIET:
Nurse?

Nurse:
Your lady mother comes to your room:
The day has dawned; beware, look around you.

JULIET:
Then open the window, let the day in and let life out.

ROMEO:
Farewell, farewell! one kiss and I'll come down.

JULIET:
Did you leave like this? love, lord, yes, husband, friend!
I have to hear from you every day on time,
Because in a minute there are several days:
O, on this account, I will be many in years
And here I see my Romeo again!

ROMEO:
Farewell!
I won't forget any opportunity
This will convey my greetings to you, my love.

JULIET:
Do you think we'll ever see each other again?

ROMEO:
I have no doubt about it ; and all these misfortunes will serve
For sweet speeches in our time to come.

JULIET:
O God, I have a misguided soul!
It seems to me that I see you, now you are down,
Like a dead man at the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight is failing or you're pale.

ROMEO:
And believe me, my love, in my eyes you too:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Farewell, farewell!

JULIET:
O fortune, fortune! all men call you fickle:
If you are fickle, what do you do with him?
Is it known for its faith? Be fickle, fortune;
Because then, I hope, you won't keep it for long,
But send it back.

LADY CAPULET:

JULIET:
Who is calling? is this my lady mother?
Doesn't she go to bed so late or get up so early?
What unusual cause prompts her to come here?

LADY CAPULET:
Well, how now, Juliette!

JULIET:
Madam, I am not well.

LADY CAPULET:
Are you still mourning the death of your cousin?
What, are you going to wash him from his grave with tears?
And if you could, you couldn't keep him alive;
Therefore do it: some sorrows show much love;
But much of the grief still shows a lack of spirit.

JULIET:
Yet let me mourn such a loss of feeling.

LADY CAPULET:
Then you will feel the loss, but not the friend
For which you cry.

JULIET:
Thus feeling the loss,
I can't choose but I always cry friend.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, my daughter, you don't cry so much for his death,
This is how the villain who massacred him lives.

JULIET:
What a bad lady?

LADY CAPULET:
This same villain, Romeo.

JULIET:

LADY CAPULET:
It's because the murderous traitor lives.

JULIET:
Yes, madam, within reach of my hands:
No one would want me to avenge my cousin's death!

LADY CAPULET:
We will take revenge for this, fear not:
So don't cry anymore. I will send one to Mantua,
Where this same banished runagate lives,
I will give him such an unusual drama,
That he will soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, I hope, you will be satisfied.

JULIET:
Indeed, I will never be satisfied
With Romeo, until I saw him... dead...
My poor heart is vexed for a parent.
Madam, if you could find out, but a man
To tolerate a poison, I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt of it,
Soon, sleep peacefully. O, how my heart hates
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
To break the love I had for my cousin
On his body which massacred him!

LADY CAPULET:
Find the means, and I will find such a man.
But now I'm going to tell you some happy news, my daughter.

JULIET:
And joy comes in such a needy time:
What is this, I beg you, Your Lordship?

LADY CAPULET:
Well, well, you have a prudent father, my child;
The one who, to relieve you of your heaviness,
Settled a sudden day of joy,
What you didn't expect and what I didn't hope for.

JULIET:
Madam, in happy times, what day is it?

LADY CAPULET:
Get married, my child, early next Thursday morning,
The valiant, young and noble gentleman,
The County of Paris, at the Saint-Pierre church,
I will happily make you a happy wife.

JULIET:
Now, near the church of St. Peter and Peter too,
It won't make me a happy wife.
I am surprised at this haste; that I must marry
Before the one who should be her husband comes to court.
Please tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
It will be Romeo, who you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. This is indeed news!

LADY CAPULET:
Here is your father; tell him yourself,
And see how he will take it in your hands.

CAPULET:
When the sun sets, the air is covered with dew;
But for my brother's son's sunset
It's definitely raining.
How now! a conduit, my daughter? what, still in tears?
Are you still showering? In a small body
You have counterfeited a boat, a sea, a wind;
For calm your eyes, that I can call the sea,
Ebb and flow with tears; the shell that is your body,
Navigate this salty flood; the winds, your sighs;
Who, furious with your tears, and them with them,
Without a sudden calm, it will get worse
Your body shaken by the storm. Well, my wife!
Did you give him our decree?

LADY CAPULET:
Yes sir ; but she doesn't want it, she thanks you.
I would like this idiot to get married at his grave!

CAPULET:
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, woman.
How! will she not have any? Does she not give us thanks?
Isn't she proud? Doesn't she consider herself happy?
As unworthy as it was, what we did
A gentleman then worthy to be her husband?

JULIET:
You are not proud, you are; but grateful, that you have:
I can never be proud of what I hate;
But grateful even for hatred, it means love.

CAPULET:
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
“Proud,” and “I thank you,” and “I don’t thank you; »
And yet, you are not proud, mistress servant,
Thank you no thanks, nor, proud of me, no proud,
But get your beautiful joints back into shape against next Thursday,
To accompany Paris to Saint-Pierre church,
Or I'll drag you there on a rack.
Out, you green carrion! outside, baggage!
You tallow face!

LADY CAPULET:
Fi, fi! what, are you crazy?

JULIET:
Good father, I beg you on my knees,
Listen to me with patience but just to say a word.

CAPULET:
Hang yourself, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
I tell you what: go to church on Thursday,
Or never look at me in the face again:
Don't speak, don't answer, don't answer me;
My fingers itch. Woman, we hardly thought we were happy
That God had only lent us this only child;
But now I see that this one is one too many,
And that we have a curse to have it:
On her I stand!

Nurse:
May God in heaven bless her!
You are guilty, my lord, of judging her like this.

CAPULET:
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good caution; sprinkle with your gossip, leave.

Nurse:
I'm not talking about betrayal.

CAPULET:
Oh, god, fuck.

Nurse:
Can't we talk?

CAPULET:
Peace out, you mumbling idiot!
Express your gravity on the bowl of a gossip;
Because here we don't need it.

LADY CAPULET:
You're too hot.

CAPULET:
The bread of God! It makes me angry:
Day, night, hour, tide, hour, work, play,
Alone, in company, my care has always been
For it to be paired: and having now provided
A gentleman of noble descent,
Beautiful estates, young and nobly formed,
Stuffed, as they say, with honorable pieces,
Proportioned as a man's mind would wish;
And then have a miserable fool,
A whining mammet, in the offering of his fortune,
To answer “I will not marry; I can't love,
I am too young; Please forgive me.
But as you will not marry, I forgive you:
Graze where you want, you will not lodge with me:
Look, think about it, I'm not in the habit of joking.
Thursday is near; place your hand on your heart, advise:
If you are mine, I will give you to my friend;
And you won't be, hang, beg, starve, die
the streets,
For, through my soul, I will never recognize you,
And what is mine will never do you any good:
Trust it, think about it; I won't give up.

JULIET:
Is there no mercy sitting in the clouds,
Does this see the depths of my sorrow?
O sweet mother, do not reject me!
Delay this marriage for a month, for a week;
Or, if you don't, make the bridal bed
In this dark monument where Tybalt rests.

LADY CAPULET:
Don't talk to me, because I won't say a word:
Do what you want, because I'm done with you.

JULIET:
O God! O nurse, how can we prevent this?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How will this faith return to earth,
Unless this husband sends it to me from heaven
By leaving Earth? console me, advise me.
Alas, alas, may heaven practice stratagems
On a subject as sweet as me!
What are you saying ? don't you have a word of joy?
A little comfort, nurse.

Nurse:
Well, here it is.
Romeo is banished; and everyone has nothing,
May he never dare to come back to challenge you;
Or, if he does, he must do it by stealth.
Since this is so,
I think it's best for you to marry into the county.
Oh, he's a charming gentleman!
Romeo is a dish for him: an eagle, madame,
Doesn't he have an eye so green, so lively, so beautiful?
Like Paris. Devour my heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For he surpasses your first: or if he did not,
Your first is dead; or if he was as good as he was,
Like living here and you don't use it.

JULIET:
Do you speak from your heart?

Nurse:
And my soul too;
Or reject them both.

JULIET:
Amen!

Nurse:
What?

JULIET:
Well, you comforted me wonderfully.
Come in: and tell my lady that I am gone,
Having displeased my father, in Laurence's cell,
Make a confession and be absolved.

Nurse:
Get married, I will; and this is wisely done.

JULIET:
Ancient damnation! O the wickedest demon!
Is it no longer a sin to wish me thus perjured,
Or to defame my lord with this same tongue
With which she congratulated him above
So many thousands of times? Come on, advisor;
You and my breast will now be two.
I go to the brother's house to find out his remedy:
If all else fails, I myself have the power to die.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Thursday, sir? time is very short.

PARIS:
My father Capulet wants it that way;
And it doesn't take long for me to slow down his rush.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
You say you don't know the lady's mind:
The route is uneven, I don't like it.

PARIS:
She mourns immoderately the death of Tybalt,
This is why I have spoken little about love;
For Venus does not smile in a house of tears.
Now, sir, his father considers it dangerous
That she gives so much influence to her sorrow,
And in his wisdom hastens our marriage,
To stop the flood of her tears;
Who, too preoccupied with herself,
May be distanced from her by society:
Now do you know the reason for this rush.

BROTHER LAURENCE:

PARIS:
Fortunately met, my lady and my wife!

JULIET:
It will perhaps be, sir, when I can be a wife.

PARIS:
Perhaps it will be necessary, my love, next Thursday.

JULIET:
What must be will be.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
It is a certain text.

PARIS:
Are you coming to confess to this father?

JULIET:
To answer that, I would have to admit it to you.

PARIS:
Don't deny him that you love me.

JULIET:
I will admit to you that I love it.

PARIS:
You too, I am sure, love me.

JULIET:
If I do it it will cost more,
Being talked to behind your back rather than to your face.

PARIS:
Poor soul, your face is much abused by tears.

JULIET:
Tears achieved a small victory through this;
Because it was bad enough before their grudge.

PARIS:
You are wrong, beyond tears, with this report.

JULIET:
This is not a slander, sir, it is a truth;
And what I said, I said it to his face.

PARIS:
Your face is mine, and you have slandered it.

JULIET:
It may be so, because it is not mine.
Are you free, holy father, now?
Or should I come to your house for evening mass?

BROTHER LAURENCE:
My leisure serves me, thoughtful girl, now.
My lord, we must beg for time alone.

PARIS:
Shield God, I should disrupt the devotion!
Juliette, I will wake you up early on Thursday:
In the meantime, farewell; and keep this holy kiss.

JULIET:
O close the door! and when you have done it,
Come cry with me; hope past, remedy past, help past!

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Ah, Juliette, I already know your sorrow;
This strains me beyond the compass of my mind:
I hear that you must do it, and nothing can prolong it,
Next Thursday I will get married in this county.

JULIET:
Don't tell me, brother, that you heard about this,
Unless you tell me how I can prevent it:
If in your wisdom you cannot help,
Call my resolution wise,
And with this knife, I'm going to help him later.
God has joined my heart and that of Romeo, you our hands;
And before this hand, by you to Romeo, is sealed,
Will be the label of another act,
Or my true heart with a treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this will kill them both:
This is why, from your time of long experience,
Give me counsel present, or behold,
"Between my extremes and me, this damn knife
Must play referee, referee this
What commission of your years and your art
It could bring no question of true honor.
Don’t delay speaking; I want to die,
If what you say doesn't talk about a cure.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Wait, my daughter: I see a kind of hope,
Which calls for an equally desperate execution.
How desperate it is, we would like to prevent it.
If, rather than marrying the County of Paris,
You have the strength to want to kill yourself,
So is it likely that you will undertake
Something like death to drive away this shame,
Who himself faces death to escape it:
And if you dare, I will give you a cure.

JULIET:
O, tell me to jump rather than marry Paris,
From the battlements of this tower;
Or walk in a thief manner; or tell me to hide
Where are the snakes? chain me with roaring bears;
Or lock myself in a mass grave at night,
Covered with bones of dead men,
With stinking shanks and chapless yellow skulls;
Or tell me to go to a newly made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things which, hearing them, made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
Live a spotless wife for my sweet love.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
So wait; go home, be cheerful, give your consent
To marry Paris: Wednesday is tomorrow:
Tomorrow evening, make sure you are alone;
Let your nurse not sleep with you in your room:
Take this vial, while in bed,
And drink this distilled liquor;
When soon in all your veins will flow
Cold and sleepy humor, for no pulse
Should retain native progress, but stop:
No heat, no breath will testify that you live;
The roses of your lips and your cheeks will fade
The windows of your eyes fall into ashes,
Like death, when it silences the day of life;
Each party, deprived of flexible government,
Must, stiff, austere and cold, appear like death:
And in this borrowed likeness of shrunken death
You will continue for forty-two hours,
And then wakes up as if from a pleasant sleep.
Now when the groom comes in the morning
To wake up from your bed, you are there dead:
So, according to the way of life of our country,
In your most beautiful dresses discovered on the beer
You will be carried to this same ancient vault
Where are all the Capulets' relatives?
In the meantime, against you you will wake up,
Will Romeo, through my letters, know our drift,
And here he will come: and he and I
I will watch over your awakening, and this very night
Will Romeo take you from here to Mantua.
And this will free you from this present shame;
If there is no fickle toy, nor female fear,
Reduce your value by acting on it.

JULIET:
Give me, give me! Oh, don't talk to me about fear!

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Socket; go away, be strong and prosperous
In this resolution: I will send a brother with speed
In Mantua, with my letters to your lord.

JULIET:
Love give me strength! and strength will help to afford.
Farewell, dear father!

CAPULET:
So many guests are invited as here is the brief.
Sirrah, go hire me twenty crafty cooks.

Second servant:
You will not have any sick people, sir; because I will try if they
can lick your fingers.

CAPULET:
How can you try them like this?

Second servant:
Marry you, sir, he's a sick cook who can't lick his
own fingers: therefore the one who cannot lick himself
fingers don't go with me.

CAPULET:
Come on, go.
We will be very sparsely furnished this time.
What, my daughter has gone to Brother Laurence?

Nurse:
Yes, indeed.

CAPULET:
Well, maybe he will have the opportunity to do him some good:
She is a sullen and willful prostitute.

Nurse:
See where she's coming from with a happy look.

CAPULET:
Well, my stubborn one! where did you go?

JULIET:
Where I learned to repent of sin
From the disobedient opposition
To you and your orders, and I enjoin
By Saint Laurence for prostrating me here,
And I beg your pardon: pardon, I beg you!
From now on, I am still governed by you.

CAPULET:
Send for the county; tell him this:
I will tie this knot tomorrow morning.

JULIET:
I met the young lord in Laurence's cell;
And I gave him what became the love I could,
Do not exceed the limits of modesty.

CAPULET:
Well, I'm happy about it; that's good: get up:
This is how it should be. Let me see the county;
Yes, get married, come on, I said, and take him here.
Now, before God! this reverend holy brother,
Our entire city is closely linked to it.

JULIET:
Nurse, will you come with me to my closet,
To help me sort out these necessary ornaments
As you see fit to provide me tomorrow?

LADY CAPULET:
No, not until Thursday; there is enough time.

CAPULET:
Come on, nurse, follow her: we will go to church tomorrow.

LADY CAPULET:
We will run out of supplies:
Night is approaching now.

CAPULET:
Tush, I'll stir,
And everything will be fine, I guarantee you, woman:
Go see Juliette, help her adorn it;
I won't go to bed tonight; leave me alone;
I'm going to play the housewife this time. What, ho!
They all came out. Well I'll walk myself
In the County of Paris, to prepare it
Against tomorrow: my heart is a wonderful light,
Since this same rebellious girl is so recovered.

JULIET:
Yes, these clothes are the best: but, sweet nurse,
Please leave me alone tonight,
Because I need many prayers
To move the heavens and smile at my state,
Which, you know well, is wicked and full of sin.

LADY CAPULET:
What, you're busy, ho? do you need my help?

JULIET:
No Madam ; we have selected these necessities
As befits our State of tomorrow:
So please now let me be alone,
And let the nurse sit with you tonight;
Because, I am sure, you all have your hands full,
In this sudden affair.

LADY CAPULET:
Good night:
Lie down and rest; because you need it.

JULIET:
Farewell! God knows when we will see each other again.
I have a slight cold fear running through my veins,
It almost freezes the warmth of life:
I will call them back to comfort me:
Nurse! What should she do here?
My gloomy scene that I need must act alone.
Come on, bottle.
What if this mixture doesn't work at all?
So should I get married tomorrow morning?
No, no: this forbids it: lie down there.
And if it was a poison that the brother
He subtly decided to make me die,
Lest in this marriage he be dishonored,
Because he already married me to Romeo?
I fear this is the case: and yet I think it should not be the case,
For he was again tested as a holy man.
And if, when I am laid in the tomb,
I wake up before the time Romeo
Come and redeem me? there is a scary point!
Shall I not then be suffocated in the vault,
In whose filthy mouth no healthy air breathes,
And die strangled before my Romeo arrives?
Or, if I live, isn't it very similar,
The horrible vanity of death and night,
With the terror of the place,...
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, during these hundreds of years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Where this damn Tybalt, although green on earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At certain times, in the night spirit station ;--
Alas, alas, isn't that how I,
Waking up so early, with disgusting smells,
And cries like mandrakes torn from the earth,
May living mortals go mad when they hear them:--
Oh, if I wake up, won't I be upset,
Surrounded by all these hideous fears?
And play madly with my ancestor's joints?
And tear the mutilated Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with the bones of some great relative,
Like with a club, breaking my desperate brain?
Oh, look! it seems to me that i see the ghost of my cousin
In search of Romeo, who spat out his body
On the point of a rapier: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I’m coming! This is what I drink to you.

LADY CAPULET:
Wait, take these keys and go get some more spices, nurse.

Nurse:
They ask for dates and quinces in the pastry.

CAPULET:
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second rooster crowed,
The curfew bell has rung, it’s three o’clock:
Look at the meats in the oven, good Angelique:
Don't spare the price.

Nurse:
Come on, you lit-quean, come on,
Get into bed; my goodness, you will be sick tomorrow
To watch this night.

CAPULET:
No, not at all: what! I looked before now
All night for the slightest reason, and I never got sick.

LADY CAPULET:
Yes, you have been a mouse chase in your time;
But I'm going to watch you this way now.

CAPULET:
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Now, my friend,
What's there?

First Servant:
Things for the cook, sir; but I don't know what.

CAPULET:
Hurry up, hurry up.
Sirrah, go get some drier logs:
Call Pierre, he will show you where they are.

Second servant:
I have a head, sir, who will find the newspapers,
And never bother Peter about it.

CAPULET:
Mass, and well said; a happy son of a bitch, ha!
You will be stupid. Good faith, it's day:
The county will be there with music directly,
For thus he said he would: I hear it near.
Nurse! Marry! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
Go wake Juliette, go cut her;
I'll go chat with Paris: hello, hurry up,
Hurry up ; the groom has already come:
Hurry up, I said.

Nurse:
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! quickly, I guarantee, she:
Well, lamb! well, madam! fie, you bed-beater!
Well, my love, I say! Mrs! Dear! Well, married!
What, not a word? you take your money now;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I guarantee it,
The County of Paris has arranged its rest,
That you will only rest a little. God forgive me,
Get married, and amen, how deeply she sleeps!
I have to wake her up. Madam, madame, madame!
Yes, let the county take you into your bed;
He's going to scare you, my word. Won't it be?
What, dressed! and in your clothes! and still down!
I have to wake you up; Lady! lady! lady!
Alas, alas! Help! my lady is dead!
Well, what a day I was born!
A little aqua vitae, ho! My lord! Mrs!

LADY CAPULET:
What noise is there here?

Nurse:
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET:
What is the problem?

Nurse:
Look look! O heavy day!

LADY CAPULET:
O me, oh me! My child, my only life,
Come back to life, look up, or I will die with you!
Help! Call for help.

CAPULET:
Out of shame, take Juliette out; his lord has come.

Nurse:
She died, died, she died; alas the day!

LADY CAPULET:
Alas, she is dead, she is dead, she is dead!

CAPULET:
Ha! let me see her: outside, alas! she is cold :
His blood is calm and his joints are stiff;
Life and these lips have long been separated:
Death spreads over her like an untimely frost
On the sweetest flower of all the fields.

Nurse:
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET:
O terrible time!

CAPULET:
Death, who took her from here to make me moan,
He ties my tongue and won't let me speak.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

CAPULET:
Ready to leave, but never to return.
O son! the day before your wedding
Is death lying with your wife. There she rests,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;
He married my daughter: I will die,
And leave it all; life, life, everything belongs to Death.

PARIS:
Did I think long to see the face of this morning,
And does it give me such a spectacle?

LADY CAPULET:
Cursed, unhappy, miserable, odious day!
The most miserable hour I've ever seen
In the lasting work of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor, a poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and comfort,
And cruel death snatched him from my eyes!

Nurse:
Oh misfortune! O awful, awful, awful day!
The most lamentable day, the most dreadful day,
This, always, always, I have seen it again!
Oh day! Oh day! Oh day! O odious day!
We have never seen a day as dark as this:
O awful day, oh awful day!

PARIS:
Seduced, divorced, wronged, thwarted, killed!
The most detestable death, which you have seduced,
By cruel cruel, you are completely bowled over!
O love! O life! not life, but love in death!

CAPULET:
Despised, afflicted, hated, martyred, killed!
Uncomfortable moment, why did you come now
Murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
You are dead ! A lack! my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Peace, ho, shame! The cure for confusion does not live
In these confusions. The sky and you
Had part in this beautiful young girl; now the sky has everything,
And so much the better for the maid:
Your role in her, you couldn't stop her from dying,
But heaven keeps its part in eternal life.
All you were looking for was his promotion;
For it was your paradise, it should be brought forward:
And cry now, seeing that she is advanced
Above the clouds, as high as the sky itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so badly,
That you are going crazy, seeing that she is fine:
She is not well married and lives married for a long time;
But it is better to marry when you die married young.
Dry your tears and stick your rosemary
On this beautiful body; and, as is usual,
In all her most beautiful outfit, wear her to church:
For although tender nature makes us lament,
Yet the tears of nature are the joy of reason.

CAPULET:
All the things we have ordained in celebration,
Turn away from their office for a black funeral;
Our instruments with melancholy bells,
Our wedding joy at a sad funeral feast,
Our solemn hymns with sullen songs change,
Our wedding flowers are used for a buried corpse,
And all things change them on the contrary.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Sir, come in; and, madam, go with him;
And go, Sir Paris; everyone gets ready
To follow this beautiful corpse to its grave:
The heavens mourn over you because of some evil;
Do not move them anymore by crossing their high will.

First musician:
My goodness, we can put down our hoses and leave.

Nurse:
Honest friends, ah, bear with one another, bear with one another;
Because, you know, it's a pitiful case.

First musician:
Yes, my word, the matter can be amended.

ROCK :
Musicians, oh musicians, "Peace of the heart, peace of the heart
ease: 'Oh, and you'll make me play live' 'Heart's easy.'

First musician:
Why “tranquility of the heart?” »

ROCK :
O musicians, because my heart itself plays "My
the heart is full of woe: 'Oh, play me a merry dump,
to comfort me.

First musician:
We are not a dump; Now is not the time to play.

ROCK :
You won't do it, then?

First musician:
No.

ROCK :
I will then give it to you sincerely.

First musician:
What are you going to give us?

ROCK :
Not money, on my faith, but joy;
I'll give you the minstrel.

First musician:
Then I will give you the servant creature.

ROCK :
So will I lay the serving creature's dagger on
your pâté. I won't wear hooks: I will take care of you,
I will love you ; do you notice me?

First musician:
And you are us and we, you notice us.

Second musician:
Please raise your dagger and show your spirit.

ROCK :
So attack with my mind! I'm going to beat you dry
with a spirit of iron, and I brandished my iron dagger. Answer
me like men:
"When sorrow persists, the heart is wounded,
And mournful discharges oppress the spirit,
Then music with its silvery sound'--
why “silver sound”? why music with its money
her'? What do you say, Simon Catling?

Musician:
Get married, sir, for money has a sweet sound.

ROCK :
Pretty! What do you say, Hugh Rebeck?

Second musician:
I say “his money” because musicians play for money.

ROCK :
Pretty too! What do you say, James Soundpost?

Third musician:
Well, I don't know what to say.

ROCK :
Oh, I cry out to you for mercy; you are the singer: I will say
for you. It's "music with its silvery sound",
because musicians have no gold with which to sound:
'Then the music with its silvery sound
With quick help, I lend repair.

First musician:
What a pestilential rascal he is!

Second musician:
Hang him, Jack! Come, we will enter here; wait for it
mourners, and stay for dinner.

ROMEO:
If I can trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams portend joyful news at hand:
The lord of my bosom sits lightly on his throne;
And all this day an unusual spirit
Lifts me above the ground with joyful thoughts.
I dreamed that my lady came and found me dead...
Strange dream, which gives leave to a dead person
think!--
And I breathed such life with kisses on my lips,
That I resurrected and was emperor.
Oh me! how sweet love itself is,
When the shadows of love are so rich in joy!
News from Verona!... Well, Balthasar!
Don't you bring me letters from my brother?
How is my lady? Is my father okay?
How is my Juliette doing? which I ask again;
Because nothing can be sick, if it is well.

BALTHASAR:
So she is fine, and nothing can be sick:
His body sleeps in the Capel monument,
And his immortal part with the angels lives.
I saw her lying in her relatives' vault,
And I took the post to tell you:
Oh, forgive me for bringing this bad news,
Since you left it for my office, sir.

ROMEO:
Is this still the case? so I challenge you, stars!
You know my accommodation: give me ink and paper,
And hire post horses; So I will do it this evening.

BALTHASAR:
I beg you, sir, to be patient:
Your looks are pale and wild, and matter
A mishap.

ROMEO:
Tush, you are wrong:
Leave me and do what I tell you.
Don't you have any letters for me from your brother?

BALTHASAR:
No, my good lord.

ROMEO:
It doesn't matter: go away,
And praise these horses; I will be with you directly.
Well, Juliette, I will sleep with you tonight.
Let us see the means: O mischief, you are quick
To enter the thoughts of desperate men!
I remember an apothecary,--
And that's pretty much where he lives, which I noticed late
In tattered grass, with crushing brows,
Elimination of simple ones; thin was his appearance,
Acute misery had exhausted him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a turtle hung,
An alligator thing and other skins
Malformed fish; and about its shelves
A miserable count of empty boxes,
Pots of green earth, bladders and moldy seeds,
Leftover yarn and old rose cakes,
Were scattered to make a spectacle.
Noticing this shortage, I said to myself
"And if a man needed a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a wretch who would sell it to him.
Oh, that same thought only anticipated my need;
And this same needy man must sell it to me.
If I remember correctly, this should be the house.
On vacation, the beggar's shop is closed.
What, ho! apothecary!

Apothecary:
Who is calling so loudly?

ROMEO:
Come here, man. I see you are poor:
Here, there are forty ducats: give me
A glass of poison, such equipment that speeds up soon
As it will disperse in all the veins
So that the weary taker of life may drop dead
And that the trunk may be out of breath
As violently as rushing powder fired
Hurries to get out of the belly of the fatal cannon.

Apothecary:
I possess such deadly drugs; but the law of Mantua
It is death for anyone who says them.

ROMEO:
Are you so naked and full of misery,
And you're afraid of dying? the famine is on your cheeks,
Need and oppression starve in your eyes,
Contempt and begging weigh on your back;
The world is not your friend nor the law of the world;
The world offers no laws to make you rich;
So don't be poor, but break it and take this.

Apothecary:
My poverty, but not my will, consents.

ROMEO:
I pay for your poverty and not your will.

Apothecary:
Put that in any liquid you want,
And drink it; and if you had the strength
Out of twenty men, that would eliminate you directly.

ROMEO:
Here is your gold, the worst poison for the souls of men,
Make more killings in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that you can't sell.
I sell you poison; you didn't sell me any.
Farewell: buy some food and put yourself in the flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, come with me
At Juliet's grave; for that is where I must use you.

BROTHER JOHN:
Holy Franciscan Brother! brother, ho!

BROTHER LAURENCE:
This same voice should be that of Brother Jean.
Welcome from Mantua: what does Romeo say?
Or, if he thinks so, give me his letter.

BROTHER JOHN:
I'm going to find a barefoot brother
One of our orders, to associate me,
Here in this city, visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the city,
Suspecting we were both in a house
Where the contagious plague reigned,
He sealed the doors and would not let us out;
So that my route to Mantua was stopped.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Who brought my letter to Romeo?

BROTHER JOHN:
I couldn't send it, here it is again,
And don't ask a messenger to bring it to you,
They were so afraid of infection.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Unfortunate fortune! by my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of great importance, and neglect it
Can present a lot of danger. Brother Jean, go;
Give me an iron crow and bring it straight
In my cell.

BROTHER JOHN:
Brother, I'll bring it to you.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Now I must go to the monument alone;
In three hours, the beautiful Juliette will wake up:
She's going to eat me much more than Romeo
He had no notification of these accidents;
But I will still write to Mantua,
And keep her in my cell until Romeo comes;
Poor living corpse, locked in a tomb of death!

PARIS:
Give me your torch, my boy: go then and stand aside:
Still, turn it off, because I won't be seen.
Under these yews you lay all the time,
Holding your ear close to the hollow ground;
So no foot will tread the cemetery,
To be cowardly, crippled, to have dug graves,
But you will hear it: whistle to me then,
As a signal that you hear something approaching.
Give me these flowers. Do what I tell you, leave.

PAGE:

PARIS:
Sweet flower, I adorn your wedding bed with flowers, -
Oh misfortune! your cover is dust and stones; -
That I dew every evening with sweet water,
Or, wanting this, with tears distilled by groans:
The funeral I will keep for you
Every night it will be to spread your grave and cry.
The boy warns that something is coming.
What cursed foot wanders here this night,
To get through my funeral and the rite of true love?
What with a torch! suffocate me, at night, for a moment.

ROMEO:
Give me this pickaxe and this tearing iron.
Wait, take this letter; early in the morning
Give it to my lord and father.
Give me light: over your life I charge you,
Whatever you hear or see, stay away,
And don't interrupt me in my lesson.
Why am I going down to this deathbed,
It is partly to see my lady's face;
But above all to remove some from his dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In a dear job: therefore, go:
But if you, jealous, come back to search
In what I intend to do further,
By heaven I will tear you apart joint by joint
And dot this hungry cemetery with your members:
Time and my intentions are wild,
Fiercer and more inexorable away
Than empty tigers or a roaring sea.

BALTHASAR:
I will leave, sir, and I will not disturb you.

ROMEO:
Then you will show me friendship. Take this :
Live and be prosperous: and farewell, my good boy.

BALTHASAR:

ROMEO:
You, detestable face, belly of death,
Gorged with the dearest piece of earth,
So I force your rotten jaws to open,
And despite everything, I will stuff you with food!

PARIS:
It is this haughty and banished Montague,
Who murdered my love's cousin, with what sorrow,
It is assumed that the beautiful creature is dead;
And here comes to cause a villainous shame
To the corpses: I will apprehend him.
Stop your impious toil, vile Montague!
Can revenge go beyond death?
Wicked convict, I apprehend you:
Obey and come with me; because you must die.

ROMEO:
It is indeed necessary; that's why I came here.
Good and gentle young man, do not tempt a desperate man;
Flee from here and leave me: think of those who are gone;
Let them scare you. I beg you, youth,
Don't put another sin on my head,
Driving me to fury: O, go!
By heaven, I love you more than myself;
For I come here armed against myself:
Don't stay, go; live, and say below:
The mercy of a madman ordered you to flee.

PARIS:
I defy your conjurations,
And apprehend you here for a criminal.

ROMEO:
Do you want to provoke me? so go ahead, boy!

PAGE:
O Lord, they are fighting! I'll call the watch.

PARIS:
Oh, I'm killed!
If you are merciful,
Open the tomb, put me to bed with Juliette.

ROMEO:
In all faith, I will. Let me look over this face.
Kin of Mercutio, noble county of Paris!
What did my man say, when my tormented soul
Didn't you accompany him while we rode? I think
He told me that Paris should have married Juliette:
He said no? Or did I dream it like this?
Or am I crazy to hear him talk about Juliette,
To think that it was so? Oh, give me your hand,
A writing with me in the book of sour woe!
I will bury you in a triumphant tomb;
A grave? Oh no ! a lantern, a massacred youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault has a festive presence full of light.
Death, lie there, near a buried dead.
How many times when men are about to die
How happy they were! that their guardians call
A flash before death: O, how can I
Would you call that lightning? O my love! my wife!
Death, which sucked the honey from your breath,
He has yet to have any power over your beauty:
You are not conquered; the beauty brand is still
Is crimson on your lips and on your cheeks,
And the pale flag of death is not raised there.
Tybalt, do you lie there in your bloody sheet?
Oh, what more favor can I do you,
That with this hand that cut your youth in two
To break the one who was your enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliette,
Why are you so beautiful ? should I believe
This insignificant death is loving,
And that the thin and abhorred monster keeps
You here in the dark to be her lover?
For fear of this, I will always remain with you;
And never from this palace of the dark night
Leave again: here, here I will stay
With worms that are your maids; Oh, here
Will I establish my eternal rest,
And shake off the yoke of the ominous stars
Of this world-weary flesh. Eyes, look at your last one!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, oh you
The doors of breath, seal them with a righteous kiss
An undated affair for a captivating death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, disreputable guide!
You, desperate pilot, run now immediately
The dashing one rocks your tired and seasick bark!
So much for my love!
O true apothecary!
Your medications are fast. So with a kiss I die.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Saint Francis be my speed! how often tonight
My old feet have tripped over the graves! Who is here?

BALTHASAR:
Here is one, a friend and one who knows you well.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Happiness be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is there, which lends its light in vain
To larvae and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burns in the Capel monument.

BALTHASAR:
It is so, holy sir; and here is my master,
The one you love.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Who is it?

BALTHASAR:
Romeo.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
How long has he been there?

BALTHASAR:
A full half hour.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Come with me to the safe.

BALTHASAR:
I don't dare, sir
My master does not know it but I have left here;
And he terribly threatened to kill me,
If I stayed to see his intentions.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
So stay; I will go alone. Fear invades me:
Oh, I'm so afraid of something unlucky.

BALTHASAR:
As I slept here under this yew tree,
I dreamed that my master and another were fighting,
And my master killed him.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
Romeo!
Alas, alas, what blood is it, which stains
The stony entrance to this tomb?
What do these masterless and bloody swords mean
Remain discolored by this place of peace?
Romeo! O pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
And drenched in blood? Ah, what a wicked hour
Is guilty of this pitiful luck!
The lady moves.

JULIET:
O comfortable brother! where is my lord?
I remember well where I should be,
And here I am. Where is my Romeo?

BROTHER LAURENCE:
I hear a noise. Lady, come from this nest
Of death, contagion and unnatural sleep:
A power greater than we can contradict
Thwarted our intentions. Come come.
Your husband died in your womb;
And Paris too. Come on, I'll get rid of you
Among a brotherhood of holy nuns:
Don't ask questions, because the watch is coming;
Come, go ahead, good Juliette,
I don't dare to stay any longer.

JULIET:
Go, go, because I will not go.
What's here? a cup, closed in the hand of my true love?
The poison, I see, was its timeless end:
O idiot! I drank it all and left not a single friendly drop
To help me afterwards? I will kiss your lips;
Maybe a poison still weighs on them,
Make die with a repairman.
Your lips are warm.

First goalkeeper:

JULIET:
Yeah, noise? so I will be brief. O happy dagger!
This is your sheath;
there rust, and let me die.

PAGE:
It's the ideal place; where the torch burns.

First goalkeeper:
The ground is bloody; search in the cemetery:
Come on, some of you, whoever you find, tie them up.
Pitiful spectacle! here lies the slain county,
And Juliette bleeding, hot and newly dead,
Who has been buried here for two days?
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
Find the Montagues: others are looking for:
We see the ground on which these misfortunes rest;
But the real reason for all these pitiful misfortunes
We cannot detect it without circumstances.

Second goalkeeper:
Here is Romeo's man; we found it in the cemetery.

First goalkeeper:
Keep him safe until the prince comes here.

Third goalkeeper:
Here is a brother who trembles, sighs and cries:
We took this pickaxe and this spade from him,
As he was coming from this side of the cemetery.

First goalkeeper:
A big suspicion: stay the brother too.

PRINCE:
What misadventure is so early,
This calls our person from our morning rest?

CAPULET:
What makes them shout like this abroad?

LADY CAPULET:
People in the street shout Romeo,
A bit of Juliette and Paris; and everyone runs,
With an open cry towards our monument.

PRINCE:
What is this fear that surprises our ears?

First goalkeeper:
Sovereign, here rests the slain county of Paris;
And Romeo is dead; and Juliette, who died previously,
Hot and new killed.

PRINCE:
Search, search and know how this vile murder occurs.

First goalkeeper:
Here is a brother who massacred Romeo's man;
With instruments on it, fit to open
The graves of these dead.

CAPULET:
O heaven! O woman, look how our daughter is bleeding!
This dagger has mista'en - for, behold, his house
Is empty at the back of Montague,...
And it is poorly sheathed in my daughter's womb!

LADY CAPULET:
O me! this sight of death is like a bell,
This warns my old age of a grave.

PRINCE:
Come, Montague; because you are early,
To see your son and heir sooner.

ASSEMBLY :
Alas, my lord, my wife died last night;
The grief of my son's exile took his breath away:
What other misfortune conspires against my age?

PRINCE:
Look, and you will see.

ASSEMBLY :
O you uneducated! what manners are there in this?
To hurry past your father to the grave?

PRINCE:
Seal the mouth of indignation for a moment,
Until we can clear up these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their
true descendants;
And then I will be general of your misfortunes,
And even leads you to death: in the meantime, refrain,
And let chance be the slave of patience.
Bring out suspicious parties.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
I am the greatest, capable of the least,
But this is what we suspect the most, because the time and place
He blames me for this terrible murder;
And here I am, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excused.

PRINCE:
So tell me what you know about it right away.

BROTHER LAURENCE:
I will be brief, for my short meeting
It's not as long as a tedious story.
Romeo, who died there, was the husband of this Juliet;
And she, dead there, the faithful wife of Romeo:
I married them; and their wedding day stolen
It was the day of the end of Tybalt, whose untimely death
I banished the new husband from the city,
For whom, and not Tybalt, is Juliette pining?
You, to take away this seat of sorrow from him,
Engaged and allegedly married her by force
Towards the county of Paris: then she comes towards me,
And, with wild looks, tell me to invent a villain
To rid her of this second marriage,
Or, in my cell, she would commit suicide.
Then I gave him, so instructed by my art,
A sleeping potion; which thus took effect
As I expected, because it did
The shape of death: in the meantime I write to Romeo,
Let him come here on this terrible night,
To help bring her out of her borrowed grave,
This is the time when the strength of the potion should cease.
But the one who carried my letter, Brother Jean,
I was left by accident, and last night
I sent my letter back. Then all alone
At the predetermined time of his awakening,
I came to look for her in her relatives' vault;
That is to say, keep it near my cell,
Until I could easily send to Romeo:
But when I arrived, a few minutes before time
From his awakening, here lying prematurely
The noble Paris and the true Romeo are dead.
She wakes up ; and I begged her to come out,
And bear with patience this work of heaven:
But then a noise frightened me coming from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, didn't want to accompany me,
But, it seems, she did violence to herself.
All this I know; and at the wedding
His nurse knows: and, if there is something in all this
Miscarriage by my fault, leave my old life
To be sacrificed, a few hours before his time,
To the rigor of the most severe laws.

PRINCE:
We still know you as a holy man.
Where is Romeo's man? what can he say in that?

BALTHASAR:
I brought the news of Juliette's death to my master;
And then in office he came from Mantua
At this same place, at this same monument.
This letter he asked me to give to his father,
And threatened me with death, entering the vault,
I didn't walk away and leave it there.

PRINCE:
Give me the letter; I'll look into it.
Where is the county page that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master this place?

PAGE:
He came with flowers to scatter his lady's grave;
And told me to stay away, and that's what I did:
Soon someone comes with light to open the tomb;
And little by little my master attracted him;
And then I ran off to call the watch.

PRINCE:
This letter confirms the brother's words,
Their journey of love, the news of his death:
And here he writes that he bought poison
From a poor 'pothecary, and with that
I came to this vault to die and sleep with Juliette.
Where are these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See what scourge is imposed on your hatred,
May heaven find a way to kill your joys with love.
And me too for winking at your discords
I lost two parents: all are punished.

CAPULET:
O brother Montague, give me your hand:
It's my daughter's joint, for nothing more
May I demand.

ASSEMBLY :
But I can give you more:
For I will set up his image of pure gold;
Although Verona is known by this name,
No amount will be fixed at such a rate
Like that of the true and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET:
Romeo will also be rich thanks to his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

PRINCE:
It brings a dark peace this morning;
The sun, out of sorrow, will not show its head:
Go and talk more about these sad things;
Some will be forgiven and some will be punished:
Because never has a story been more unfortunate
Than that of Juliet and her Romeo.

WARWICK:
I wonder how the king escaped our hands.

YORK:
While we pursued the horsemen from the north,
He sneakily fled and left his men:
Then the great lord of Northumberland,
Whose warlike ears would never bear retreat,
Raised the morale of the weakened army; and himself,
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
We charged the front of our main battle and broke in
Were killed by the swords of common soldiers.

EDWARD:
The father of Lord Stafford, Duke of Buckingham,
Is either killed or dangerously injured;
I split his beaver with a clean blow:
It's true, my father, see his blood.

ASSEMBLY :
And, brother, here is the blood of the Earl of Wiltshire,
Which I encountered as the battles joined.

RICHARD:
Speak for me and tell them what I did.

YORK:
Richard deserved the best of all my sons.
But is your grace dead, my lord of Somerset?

NORFOLK:
What hope has the entire lineage of John of Gaunt!

RICHARD:
This is how I hope to shake King Henry's head.

WARWICK:
And me too. Victorious Prince of York,
Before I see you sitting on this throne
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
I swear by heaven these eyes will never close.
This is the palace of the fearful king,
And this is the royal seat: own it, York;
For this is yours and not that of King Henry's heirs.

YORK:
Help me then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
For here we have entered by force.

NORFOLK:
We will all help you; he who steals will die.

YORK:
Thank you, kind Norfolk: stay close to me, my lords;
And, soldiers, stay and spend the night near me.

WARWICK:
And when the king comes, offer no violence,
Unless he's trying to evict you by force.

YORK:
The queen holds her parliament here today,
But few people think that we will be of his advice:
By words or by blows, let us win our right here.

RICHARD:
Armed as we are, let's stay in this house.

WARWICK:
Will the bloody parliament be called,
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, is king,
And the timid Henry deposed, whose cowardice
He gave us words to our enemies.

YORK:
So leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
I want to take possession of my right.

WARWICK:
Neither the king, nor the one who loves him most,
The proudest is he who supports Lancaster,
Dare to move a wing, if Warwick shakes his bells.
I will plant Plantagenêt, uproot whoever dares:
Make up your mind, Richard; claim the English crown.

KING HENRY VI:
My lords, look where the strong rebel is,
Even at the presidency of the state: as he means,
Supported by the power of Warwick, this false peer,
Aspire to the crown and reign as king.
Earl of Northumberland, he killed your father.
And yours, Lord Clifford; and you both swore revenge
On him, his sons, his favorites and his friends.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I don't, may God take revenge on me!

CLIFFORD:
Hope makes Clifford cry in the steel.

WESTERN MORELAND:
What, are we going to put up with this? let's tear it off:
My heart burns with anger; I can not support it.

KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.

CLIFFORD:
Patience is for cowards, like him:
He wouldn't have dared to stay there if your father had lived.
My gracious lord, here in parliament
Let's attack York's family.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
You have spoken well, cousin: so be it.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, you don't know that the city favors them,
And they have troops of soldiers at their service?

EXECUTE:
But when the duke is killed, they will quickly flee.

KING HENRY VI:
Far from Henry's heart this thought,
Make a disaster in Parliament!
Exeter's cousin, frowns, words and threats
This will be the war Henry intends to use.
You, factious Duke of York, come down to my throne,
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
I am your sovereign.

YORK:
I'm yours.

EXECUTE:
For shame, come down: he made you Duke of York.

YORK:
It was my heritage, as was the county.

EXECUTE:
Your father was a traitor to the crown.

WARWICK:
Exeter, you are a traitor to the crown
By following this usurping Henry.

CLIFFORD:
Who should he follow but his natural king?

WARWICK:
It's true, Clifford; and this is Richard Duke of York.

KING HENRY VI:
And shall I arise, and you sit on my throne?

YORK:
It must be like this: be content with yourself.

WARWICK:
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.

WESTERN MORELAND:
He is both king and duke of Lancaster;
And this the Lord of Westmoreland will maintain.

WARWICK:
And Warwick will refute it. You forget
That we are the ones who chased you from the field
And you killed your fathers, and with spilled colors
I walked through the city to the palace gates.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my great regret;
And, by his soul, you and your house will miss him.

WESTERN MORELAND:
Plantagenet, of you and your sons,
Your relative and your friends, I will have more lives
That drops of blood flowed through my father's veins.

CLIFFORD:
Don't insist any more; lest instead of words,
I send you, Warwick, such a messenger
As I will avenge his death before I move.

WARWICK:
Poor Clifford! how I despise his useless threats!

YORK:
Will we show our title to the crown?
Otherwise, our swords will plead for him on the field.

KING HENRY VI:
What title do you have, traitor, to the crown?
Your father was, like you, Duke of York;
Your grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
I am the son of Henry V,
Who brought down the Dauphin and the French
And captured their cities and their provinces.

WARWICK:
Don't talk about France, since you have lost everything.

KING HENRY VI:
It was the lord protector who lost it, and not me:
When I was crowned, I was only nine months old.

RICHARD:
You are quite old now, and yet it seems to me that you are losing.
Father, tear the crown from the head of the usurper.

EDWARD:
Sweet father, do it; put it on your head.

ASSEMBLY :
Good brother, how you love and honor weapons,
Let's fight and not continue to quibble like this.

RICHARD:
Sound the drums and the trumpets, and the king will fly away.

YORK:
My sons, peace!

KING HENRY VI:
Peace, you! and give King Henry permission to speak.

WARWICK:
Plantagenet will speak first: listen to him, lords;
And be silent and attentive too,
For whoever interrupts it will not live.

KING HENRY VI:
Do you think I will leave my royal throne,
Where were my grandfather and father sitting?
No: first, war will be depopulated in my kingdom;
Yes, and their colors, often worn in France,
And now in England, to our great sorrow,
This will be my shroud. Why do you faint, lords?
My title is good, and far better than his.

WARWICK:
Prove it, Henry, and you will be king.

KING HENRY VI:
Henry IV obtained the crown by conquest.

YORK:
It was in rebellion against his king.

KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
So what ?

KING HENRY VI:
And if he can, then I am the rightful king;
For Richard, in the eyes of many lords,
Renounced the crown to Henry IV,
Of which my father was the heir, and I am his.

YORK:
He rose up against him, being his sovereign,
And made him forcibly give up his crown.

WARWICK:
Suppose, my lords, that he did it without constraint,
Do you think you have damaged his crown?

EXECUTE:
No; because he could not thus renounce his crown
But may the next heir succeed and reign.

KING HENRY VI:
Are you against us, Duke of Exeter?

EXECUTE:
He is right, and therefore, forgive me.

YORK:
Why whisper to you, my lords, and not answer?

EXECUTE:
My conscience tells me that he is the rightful king.

KING HENRY VI:

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Plantagenet, despite all your pretensions,
Do not think that Henry is thus deposed.

WARWICK:
It will be filed, regardless.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
You are deceived: it is not your southern power,
Of Essex, of Norfolk, of Suffolk, nor of Kent,
What makes you so presumptuous and proud,
I can trap the duke against my will.

CLIFFORD:
King Henry, whether your title is true or false,
Lord Clifford swears to fight in your defense:
May this ground gape and swallow me alive,
Where I will kneel before the one who killed my father!

KING HENRY VI:
O Clifford, how your words revive my heart!

YORK:
Henry of Lancaster, renounce your crown.
What do you whisper or plot, lords?

WARWICK:
Do good to this princely Duke of York,
Or I will fill the house with armed men,
And above the seat of state, where he now sits,
Write its title with usurping blood.

KING HENRY VI:
My Lord of Warwick, listen to me, but one word:
For this reason let me reign all my life as king.

YORK:
Confirm the crown to me and my heirs,
And you will reign in peace as long as you live.

KING HENRY VI:
I am happy: Richard Plantagenêt,
Enjoy the kingdom after I pass away.

CLIFFORD:
What harm does this do to the prince, your son!

WARWICK:
Of what use is this to England and himself!

WESTERN MORELAND:
Infamous, fearful and desperate Henry!

CLIFFORD:
How have you harmed yourself and us!

WESTERN MORELAND:
I can't stay to hear these articles.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nor me.

CLIFFORD:
Come, cousin, let us announce this news to the queen.

WESTERN MORELAND:
Farewell, pusillanimous and degenerate king,
In whose cold blood no spark of honor resides.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be a prey to the house of York,
And die as a group for this shameful act!

CLIFFORD:
In a terrible war may you be defeated,
Or live in peace, abandoned and despised!

WARWICK:
Turn around here, Henry, and don't look at them.

EXECUTE:
They seek revenge and therefore will not give in.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, Exeter!

WARWICK:
Why should you sigh, my lord?

KING HENRY VI:
Not for me, Lord Warwick, but for my son,
That I will disinherit against nature.
But anyway: I hear here
The crown to you and your heirs forever;
On condition, that you take an oath here
To end this civil war, and, as long as I live,
To honor me as your king and sovereign,
And neither by betrayal nor by hostility
Seeking to bring me down and rule over you.

YORK:
I take this oath willingly and I will respect it.

WARWICK:
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet kisses him.

KING HENRY VI:
And long life to you and your avant-garde sons!

YORK:
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.

EXECUTE:
Cursed be he who seeks to make enemies!

YORK:
Farewell, my gracious lord; I'm going to my castle.

WARWICK:
And I will guard London with my soldiers.

NORFOLK:
And me in Norfolk with my supporters.

ASSEMBLY :
And I towards the sea from which I came.

KING HENRY VI:
And I, with sorrow and sorrow, to court.

EXECUTE:
Here comes the queen, whose looks betray her anger:
I'm going to fly.

KING HENRY VI:
Exeter, me too.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
No, don't move away from me; I will follow you.

KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, sweet queen, and I will stay.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Who can be patient in such extremes?
Ah, wretch! I would have died a servant
And I never saw you, I never gave you a son,
Seeing that you turned out to be such an unnatural father
Did he thus deserve to lose his birthright?
If you had loved him half as well as I did,
Or felt that pain that I did to him once,
Or I fed him as I did with my blood,
You would have left your dearest heart blood there,
Rather than having this wild duke as his heir
And I have disinherited your only son.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Father, you cannot disinherit me:
If you are king, why should I not succeed?

KING HENRY VI:
Forgive me, Margaret; forgive me, my sweet son:
The Earl of Warwick and the Duke forced me.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
I forced you! art thou king, and wilt thou be forced?
I'm ashamed to hear you speak. Ah, fearful wretch!
You have undone yourself, your son and me;
And gave the house of York such a leader
As you will reign but through their suffering.
To involve him and his heirs in the crown,
What is it, if not making your sepulcher
And slip in well before your time?
Warwick is chancellor and lord of Calais;
Stern Falconbridge dominates the narrow seas;
The duke is named protector of the kingdom;
And yet, will you be safe? such security findings
The trembling lamb surrounded by wolves.
If I had been there, what a stupid woman I am,
The soldiers should have thrown me on their pikes
Before, I would have granted this act.
But you prefer your life to your honor:
And seeing that you do it, I divorce here
From your table, Henry, and from your bed,
Until this Act of Parliament is repealed
By which my son is disinherited.
The lords of the north who renounced your colors
Mine will follow, if once they see them spreading;
And they will spread, to your shameful shame
And the total ruin of the house of York.
So I'm leaving you. Come, my son, let us go;
Our army is ready; come, we will pursue them.

KING HENRY VI:
Stay, sweet Margaret, and listen to me speak.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
You've already talked too much: go away.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet son Edward, will you stay with me?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Yes, being murdered by your enemies.

PRINCE EDWARD:
When I return with victory on the field
I will see your grace: in the meantime, I will follow it.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Come, my son, go away; we cannot linger like this.

KING HENRY VI:
Poor queen! what love for me and for his son
This made him burst into rage!
May she be avenged by this odious duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
It will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
Be weary of my flesh and that of my son!
The loss of these three lords torments my heart:
I will write to them and I will beg them fairly.
Come, cousin, you will be the messenger.

EXECUTE:
And I, I hope, will reconcile them all.
3KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Brother, even though I am the youngest, give me permission.

EDWARD:
No, I can play the speaker better.

ASSEMBLY :
But I have strong and compelling reasons.

YORK:
Well, how now, son and brother! during a conflict?
What is your quarrel? how did it start?

EDWARD:
No quarrel, but a slight argument.

YORK:
About what?

RICHARD:
Of what concerns your grace and us;
The crown of England, my father, which is yours.

YORK:
My boy ? not before the death of King Henry.

RICHARD:
Your right does not depend on his life or death.

EDWARD:
Now you are an heir, so take advantage now:
By letting the house of Lancaster breathe,
This will eventually overtake you, father.

YORK:
I took an oath that he would reign peacefully.

EDWARD:
But for a kingdom, any oath can be broken:
I would break a thousand oaths to reign for one year.

RICHARD:
No; God forbid that your grace be abandoned.

YORK:
I will be, if I claim by open war.

RICHARD:
I will prove otherwise, if you hear me speak.

YORK:
You cannot, my son; it's impossible.

RICHARD:
An oath has no importance if it is not taken
Before a true and legal magistrate,
Who has authority over him who swears:
Henry had none, but usurped the place;
Then, seeing that it was he who had you deposed,
Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
So, to arms! And, father, just think
How sweet it is to wear a crown!
In the circuit of which the Elysée is located
And all this, the poets feign happiness and joy.
Why do we finger like this? I can't rest
Until the white rose I wear is dyed
Even in the warm blood of Henry's heart.

YORK:
Richard, that's enough; I will be king, or I will die.
Brother, you are going to London soon,
And incite Warwick to this enterprise.
You, Richard, owe it to the Duke of Norfolk,
And tell him privately our intention.
You, Edward, owe to my lord Cobham,
With whom the Kentishmen will gladly rise:
I trust them; because they are soldiers,
Witty, courteous, liberal, witty.
While you are thus employed, what more remains,
But I am looking for an opportunity to elevate myself,
And yet the king is not aware of my excesses,
Nor any member of the House of Lancaster?
But let's stay: what news? Why do you come to such a position?

Messenger:
The Queen with all the earls and lords of the North
Hear you here besieged in your castle:
She is nearby with twenty thousand men;
And therefore fortify your position, my lord.

YORK:
Yes, with my sword. What! do you think we fear them?
Edward and Richard, you will stay with me;
My brother Montague will post in London:
May noble Warwick, Cobham and the rest,
Whom we left as protectors of the king,
With a powerful policy, strengthen itself,
And don't trust simple Henry or his oaths.

ASSEMBLY :
Brother, I'm going; I will win them, have no fear:
This is why I very humbly take my leave.
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, my uncles,
You arrive at Sandal in a happy hour;
The queen's army wants to besiege us.

JOHN MORTIMER:
She won't need it; we will meet her on the ground.

YORK:
What, with five thousand men?

RICHARD:
Yes, with five hundred, my father, for a need:
A female general; what should we fear?

EDWARD:
I hear their drums: let's put our men in order,
And come out and tell them to fight straight.

YORK:
Five men against twenty! even if the chances are great,
I have no doubt, uncle, of our victory.
I have won many battles in France,
When the enemy was ten to one:
Why wouldn't I have the same success now?
3KING HENRY VI

RUTLAND:
Ah, where must I fly to escape their hands?
Ah, guardian, look where the damn Clifford is coming from!

CLIFFORD:
Chaplain, go! your priesthood saves your life.
As for that damn duke's kid,
Whose father killed my father, he will die.

Tutor:
And I, my lord, will keep him company.

CLIFFORD:
Soldiers, far from him!

Tutor:
Ah, Clifford, don't kill this innocent child,
Lest you be hated both by God and man!

CLIFFORD:
How now! is he already dead? or is it fear
Does this make him close his eyes? I'll open them.

RUTLAND:
So looks the lion driven back on the wretched
Which trembles under its devouring paws;
And so he walks, insulting his prey,
And so he comes, to tear his members apart.
Ah, kind Clifford, kill me with your sword,
And not with such a cruel and menacing look.
Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
I am too wicked a subject for your anger:
Take revenge on men and let me live.

CLIFFORD:
It is in vain that you speak, poor boy; my father's blood
Closed the passage where your words were to enter.

RUTLAND:
As my father's blood opens it again:
He is a man and, Clifford, face him.

CLIFFORD:
If your brothers were here, their lives and yours
Was revenge not enough for me?
No, if I dug up the graves of your ancestors
And they hung their rotten coffins with chains,
It couldn’t quell my anger or calm my heart.
The view from any of York's house
It is like a fury to torment my soul;
And until I eradicate their cursed bloodline
And don't leave anyone alive, I live in hell.
SO--

RUTLAND:
Oh, let me pray before I die!
I beg you; sweet Clifford, pity me!

CLIFFORD:
What mercy the tip of my rapier offers.

RUTLAND:
I never hurt you: why will you kill me?

CLIFFORD:
Your father did it.

RUTLAND:
But that was before I was born.
You have a son ; for him, have pity on me,
Lest in vengeance, if God be just,
He will be killed as miserably as me.
Ah, let me live in prison all my days;
And when I give the opportunity to offend,
So let me die, because now you have no reason.

CLIFFORD:
No reason !
Your father killed my father; therefore, die.

RUTLAND:
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!

CLIFFORD:
Plantagenet! I'm coming, Plantagenêt!
And it's your son's blood that clings to my blade
Must rust on my weapon, until your blood,
Frozen with this, make me wipe both.
3KING HENRY VI

YORK:
The Queen's army is on the campaign:
My uncles were both killed while rescuing me;
And all my disciples to the bitter enemy
Turn around and fly, like ships into the wind
Or lambs chased by hungry wolves.
My sons, God knows what happened to them:
But that, I know, they humiliated themselves
Like men born for fame by life or death.
Three times, Richard walked towards me.
And three times he cried: “Courage, father! fight him! »
And, as often, Edward came to my side,
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
In the blood of those who had met him:
And when the most valiant warriors withdrew,
Richard shouted, “Charge!” and don't give a single foot of land!
And he cried out: “A crown, or else a glorious tomb!”
A scepter or an earthly sepulchre!
With that, we charged again: but outside, alas!
We were wrong again; like I saw a swan
With useless work, swim against the tide
And expend his strength with overmatched waves.
Oh, listen! the fatal partisans actually pursue;
And I am weak and I cannot escape their fury:
And if I were strong, I would not avoid their fury:
The sands that make up my life are numbered;
Here I must stay, and here my life must end.
Come, damn Clifford, rough Northumberland,
I dare your inextinguishable fury to more rage:
I'm your ass and I'll take your shot.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
At our mercy, proud Plantagenet.

CLIFFORD:
Yes, to the mercy of his pitiless arm,
With direct payment, shown to my father.
Now Phaeton has fallen from his car,
And makes a midday evening sting.

YORK:
My ashes, like the phoenix, can give birth
A bird that will take revenge on you all:
And in this hope I cast my eyes to the sky,
Despising everything with which you can afflict me.
Why do not you come ? What! multitudes, and fear?

CLIFFORD:
So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
So the doves peck at the piercing claws of the hawk;
Thieves so desperate, all desperate for their lives,
Express invectives against officers.

YORK:
O Clifford, but think of you once more,
And in your thoughts you have passed my former time;
And if you can blush, look at this face,
And bite your tongue, which slanders him with cowardice
Whose frown made you faint and run away before that!

CLIFFORD:
I won't speak to you word for word,
But give in to your blows, twice two for one.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Here, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
I would prolong the traitor's life for a while.
Anger makes him deaf: speak, Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Wait, Clifford! don't honor him so much
To prick your finger, but to hurt his heart:
What value was it, when a priest smiled,
For someone to put their hand between their teeth,
When could he kick him away?
It is the price of war to take all the advantages;
And ten to one is not an indictment of courage.

CLIFFORD:
Yes, yes, this is how woodcock strives with gin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The same goes for the cony struggling in the net.

YORK:
Thus the thieves triumph over their conquered booty;
So true men give in, with thieves so outmatched.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What would your grace have done to him now?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
Come, make him stand on this here molehill,
Who attacks the mountains with outstretched arms,
Yet he only separated the shadow of his hand.
What! are you the one who would be the king of England?
Aren't you who feasted in our parliament,
And have you given a sermon on your high descent?
Where are your sons to support you now?
The wanton Edward and the lusty George?
And where is this valiant trickster prodigy,
Dicky your boy, that with his growling voice
Did he use to encourage his father during mutinies?
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
Listen, York: I stained this napkin with blood
This valiant Clifford, with the point of his rapier,
Out of the boy's womb;
And if your eyes can cry for his death,
I give you this to dry your cheeks.
Alas, poor York! but I hate you mortally,
I should deplore your miserable state.
Please, sorrow, make me glad, York.
What, has your inflamed heart so dried up your insides
That not a tear can be shed for the death of Rutland?
Why are you patient, man? you should be crazy;
And I, to make you mad, I make fun of you like this.
Dab, rave and get excited, so I can sing and dance.
You would be paid, I see, for making me play:
York can't speak unless he's wearing a crown.
A crown for York! and, lords, bow down before him:
Hold his hands while I put him in place.
Yes, get married, sir, he looks like a king now!
Yes, it was he who took the chair of King Henry,
And here he was his adopted heir.
But how is it that this great Plantagenet
Is he crowned so soon and has he broken his solemn oath?
If I remember correctly, you shouldn't be king
Until our King Henry shook hands with death.
And will you fade your head in Henry's glory,
And strip her temples of the diadem,
Now in his life, against your holy oath?
Oh, this is also a mistake, too unforgivable!
Take off the crown, and with the crown his head;
And while we breathe, let's take the time to kill it.

CLIFFORD:
This is my office, for my father's sake.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
No, stay; let us listen to the prayers he makes.

YORK:
Wolf of France, but worse than the wolves of France,
Whose tongue is more venomous than the tooth of the viper!
How unpleasant it is in your sex
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
On their misfortunes that fortune captivates!
But your face is like that of a vizard, immutable,
Made impudent by the use of evil deeds,
I would try, proud queen, to make you blush.
To tell you where you come from, who you are descended from,
If you were ashamed enough to shame yourself, weren't you shameless.
Your father bears the type of the King of Naples,
From Sicilies and Jerusalem,
But not as rich as an English yeoman.
Did this poor monarch teach you to insult?
It's not necessary, and it doesn't bother you, proud queen,
Unless the adage needs to be verified,
These beggars on horseback race their horses to the death.
It is beauty that often makes women proud;
But, God knows, your part is small:
It is virtue that makes them most admired;
The opposite makes you think:
It is the government that makes them appear divine;
Lack makes you abominable:
You are the opposite of all good
As the Antipodes are to us,
Or like the south to the north.
O heart of a tiger wrapped in the skin of a woman!
How could you drain the child's blood,
To ask the father to wipe his eyes with it,
And yet be seen with a woman's face?
Women are gentle, gentle, pitiful and flexible;
You, stern, stubborn, hard, harsh, merciless.
Don't you tell me to get angry? well, now you have your wish:
Would I like to cry? well, now you have your will:
For the violent wind blows incessant showers,
And when the anger subsides, the rain begins.
These tears are the funeral of my sweet Rutland:
And every drop cries out for vengeance for his death,
"Against you," fell Clifford, "and you, false
French woman.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Angers at me, but his passion moves me so much
I can barely hold back the tears from my eyes.

YORK:
This face of hungry cannibals
I would not have touched, I would not have stained blood:
But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
O ten times more than the tigers of Hyrcania.
Look, merciless queen, at the tears of an unhappy father:
You dipped this cloth in my sweet boy's blood,
And I, with my tears, I wash away the blood.
Keep the towel, and go brag about this:
And if you tell the heavy story correctly,
On my soul, the listeners will shed tears;
Yes, even my enemies will shed tears that flow quickly,
And say: “Alas, it was a pitiful act!
There take the crown, and with the crown my curse;
And in your need, such comfort comes to you
How now I reap from your too cruel hand!
Hard-hearted Clifford, take me away from the world:
My soul to heaven, my blood on your heads!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If he had been the man of massacre for all my loved ones,
I should not for my life but cry with him.
To see how sorrow grips his soul.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
What, in tears, my Lord Northumberland?
Think about it, but it's because of the wrong he did to us all,
And it will quickly dry your melting tears.

CLIFFORD:
So much for my oath, so much for my father's death.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
And here is to righting our gentle-hearted king.

YORK:
Open your door of mercy, merciful God!
My soul flies through these wounds to seek you.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Take off his head and lay it on the gates of York;
Thus, York risks neglecting the city of York.
3KING HENRY VI

EDWARD:
I wonder how our princely father escaped,
Or whether he ran away or not
From the pursuit of Clifford and Northumberland:
If he had been arrested, we should have heard the news;
If he had been killed, we should have heard the news;
Or if he had escaped, I think we should have heard
The happy news of his successful escape.
How is my brother? why is he so sad?

RICHARD:
I can't rejoice, until I'm resolved
Where did our valiant father become?
I saw him in the battlefield;
And I watched him how he chose Clifford.
I thought he wore it in the thickest troop
Like a lion in a herd of beasts;
Or like a bear surrounded by dogs,
Who pinched some and made them cry,
The others stand aside and bark at him.
So was our father with his enemies;
Thus my warrior father fled from his enemies:
It seems to me that this is reward enough for being his son.
See how the morning opens its golden doors,
And bid farewell to the glorious sun!
How it looks like the prime of life,
Trimm would like a younger one to prance in front of his love!

EDWARD:
Dazzle my eyes, or do I see three suns?

RICHARD:
Three glorious suns, each a perfect sun;
Not separated from the tearing clouds,
But separated in a pale, clear sky.
See see! they join, kiss and seem to kiss,
As if they were swearing to an inviolable league:
They are nothing more than a single lamp, a single light, a single sun.
In this, the sky represents an event.

EDWARD:
It's wonderfully strange, like nothing we've ever heard of.
I think that quotes us, brother, on the ground,
That we, the sons of the brave Plantagenet,
Everyone already flamboyant with our meals,
Should nevertheless join our lights together
And will illuminate the earth as well as the world.
Whatever it bodes, I will bear it from now on
On my target three bright suns.

RICHARD:
No, give birth to three daughters: with your permission, I say,
You like the breeder better than the male.
But what are you, whose heavy looks portend
A terrible story clinging to your tongue?

Messenger:
Ah, the one who was a horrible spectator
When the noble Duke of York was slain,
Your princely father and my beloved lord!

EDWARD:
Oh, don't talk anymore, because I've heard too much.

RICHARD:
Tell how he died, because I will hear everything.

Messenger:
Surrounded, he was with many enemies,
And stood against them, like the hope of Troy
Against the Greeks who entered Troy.
But Hercules himself must give in in the face of difficulties;
And many blows, but with a small axe,
Cut down and cut down the hardest-wooded oak.
By many hands your father was subdued;
But only slain by the wrathful arm
Of implacable Clifford and the Queen,
Who crowned the gracious duke despite everything,
He laughed in her face; and when he cried with sorrow,
The merciless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A towel soaked with harmless blood
Of gentle young Rutland, killed by rough Clifford:
And after many contempts, many filthy taunts,
They took his head, and at the gates of York
They asked the same thing; and there it remains,
The saddest sight I have ever seen.

EDWARD:
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean on,
Now you're gone, we have no staff, no living quarters.
O Clifford, noisy Clifford! you killed
The flower of Europe for its chivalry;
And you defeated him through treachery,
In hand-to-hand combat, he would have defeated you.
Now the palace of my soul has become a prison:
Ah, would she break up with this, that it's my body
Could be locked in the ground at rest!
For from now on I will no longer rejoice,
Never, oh never will I see more joy!

RICHARD:
I can't cry; for all the moisture in my body
Rarely serves to quench my burning heart:
Neither can my tongue relieve the great burden of my heart;
For the same wind with which I should speak
They are lit coals that set my whole chest on fire,
And burns me with flames that tears would smother.
To cry is to reduce the depth of sorrow:
Tears therefore for babies; blows and revenge for me
Richard, I bear your name; I will avenge your death,
Or die of fame trying it.

EDWARD:
His name that this valiant duke left you;
His dukedom and his chair with me are left.

RICHARD:
No, if you are the bird of this princely eagle,
Show your descent looking against the sun:
For chair and duchy, throne and kingdom, say:
Either it is yours, or you were not his.

WARWICK:
Well, fair lords! What price? what news abroad?

RICHARD:
Great Lord of Warwick, if we were to tell
Our dire news, and to the deliverance of each word
Stab our daggers into our flesh until all the world is told,
Words would add more anguish than hurt.
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!

EDWARD:
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
Who held three dear to his heart as the redemption of his soul,
Did the stern Lord Clifford put him to death.

WARWICK:
Ten days ago, I drowned this news in my tears;
And now, to add more measure to your misfortunes,
I'm here to tell you what happened then.
After the bloody fight at Wakefield,
Where your brave father breathed his last,
News, as quickly as messages could travel,
I heard of your loss and his departure.
I, then in London, guardian of the king,
I gathered my soldiers, I gathered flocks of friends,
And very well appointed, as I thought,
Marched towards Saint Alban to intercept the queen,
Taking the king in my favor;
Because my scouts told me
That she came with full intention
To destroy our late decree in parliament
Concerning King Henry's oath and your estate.
A little story to tell, we met in Saint Alban
Our battles joined, and both sides fought fiercely:
But if it was the king's coldness,
Who looked sweetly at her warrior queen,
This deprived my soldiers of their burning spleens;
Or if it was a report on his success;
Or more than the common fear of Clifford's rigor,
Who thunders blood and death to his captives,
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
Their weapons came and went like lightning;
That of our soldiers, like the lazy flight of the night owl,
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
They fell gently, as if hitting their friends.
I comforted them with the righteousness of our cause,
With the promise of high salary and great rewards:
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
And we have no hope of winning the situation;
As we fled; the king to the queen;
Lord George, your brother, Norfolk and myself,
In all haste, in all haste, come to join you:
For in the marches here we heard that you were,
Make another face to fight again.

EDWARD:
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, kind Warwick?
And when did George come to England from Burgundy?

WARWICK:
Six miles away, the duke is with the soldiers;
And for your brother, he was recently sent
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
With the help of soldiers in this necessary war.

RICHARD:
It was a safe bet that the valiant Warwick escaped:
I have often heard his praises in pursuit,
But never again his retirement scandal.

WARWICK:
And now you don't hear my scandal, Richard;
For you will know my strong right hand
Can tear the diadem from Henry's head, weak,
And snatches the horrible scepter from his fist,
Was he as famous and as daring in war
As he is renowned for his gentleness, peace and prayer.

RICHARD:
I know it well, Lord Warwick; don't blame me:
It is the love that I carry, your glories make me speak.
But in these troubled times, what to do?
Shall we throw away our coats of steel,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning robes,
Number our Hail Marys with our pearls?
Or should we wear the helmets of our enemies
Recount our devotion with vengeful weapons?
If it is for the end, say yes, and to that, lords.

WARWICK:
Well, that's why Warwick came for you;
And thus comes my brother Montague.
Assist me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
With Clifford and haughty Northumberland,
And from their feathers many other proud birds,
I shaped the king which melts easily like wax.
He has sworn to consent to your inheritance,
His oath was recorded in parliament;
And now in London the whole crew is gone,
To thwart both his oath and what else
Can do against the house of Lancaster.
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
Now, with the help of Norfolk and myself,
With all your friends, brave Earl of March,
Among the loving Welsh I can procure,
Will only amount to twenty-five thousand,
Why, via! towards London, shall we march again,
And let us ride our foaming steeds again,
And shout once again “Charge our enemies!” »
But never turn around and steal again.

RICHARD:
Yes, it seems to me now that I hear the great Warwick speaking:
He will never live long enough to see a sunny day,
This screams “Retire,” if Warwick asks him to stay.

EDWARD:
Lord Warwick, I will lean on your shoulder;
And when you fail, how God forbid at that hour!
Should Edward fall, what peril God preserve us!

WARWICK:
No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
The next degree is the royal throne of England;
For you will be proclaimed king of England
In each town we pass through;
And he who does not lift his cap for joy
Must, for the fault, have his head confiscated.
King Edward, Valiant Richard, Montague,
Let us no longer stay, dreaming of fame,
But sound the trumpets, and concerning our task.

RICHARD:
So, Clifford, was your heart as hard as steel,
As you showed flint by your deeds,
I'm coming to pierce it, or give you mine.

EDWARD:
So, bang the drum: God and Saint George for us!

WARWICK:
How now! What's new?

Messenger:
The Duke of Norfolk sends you a message through me,
The queen comes with a powerful army;
And needs your company for quick advice.

WARWICK:
Why then it's all right, brave warriors, let's go.
3KING HENRY VI

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Welcome, my lord, to this brave city of York.
There is the leader of this sworn enemy
Who sought to be surrounded by your crown:
Does not this object rejoice your heart, my lord?

KING HENRY VI:
Yes, as the rocks encourage those who fear their shipwreck:
Seeing this spectacle irritates my soul.
Restrain your vengeance, my God! it's not my fault,
Nor did I willfully violate my vow.

CLIFFORD:
My gracious liege, this is too much clemency
And harmful pity must be put aside.
To whom do the lions cast their gentle glances?
Not to the beast that would usurp their lair.
Whose hand does the forest bear lick?
He is not the one who spoils his youth in front of his face.
Who escapes the deadly sting of the lurking serpent?
Not the one who puts his foot on his back.
The smallest worm will become trampled,
And the doves will peck to protect their brood.
Ambitious York levels your crown,
You smiled while he frowned angrily:
He, if he were only a duke, would have his son king,
And raise his problem, like a loving father;
You, being a king, endowed with a good son,
Did you agree to disinherit him,
Which made you a very unloving father.
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
And though the man's face is fearful in their eyes,
Yet, to protect their loved ones,
Who hasn't seen them, even with these wings
which they sometimes took advantage of with a frightening escape,
Make war on the one who climbed to their nest,
Offer their own lives in defense of their children?
For shame, my lord, make this your precedent!
Wasn't it a shame that this good boy
Should lose his birthright through his father's fault,
And long after, you will say to his child:
"What my great-grandfather and his grandfather had
My carefree father kindly confided it?
Ah, what a shame that was! Look at the boy;
And his virile face, which promises
Successful fortune, steel your melting heart
Hold his own and leave his own with him.

KING HENRY VI:
Clifford played the speaker very well,
Deduce arguments of great force.
But, Clifford, tell me, have you never heard
That things that went wrong never went wrong?
And it was always happy for this son
Because of his hoarding, what father went to hell?
I will leave my virtuous deeds behind to my son;
What if my father never left me again!
Because everything else is held at such a pace
As it brings a thousand times more care to keep
Only in possession and in joy.
Ah, cousin York! Did your best friends know
How it saddens me that your head is here!

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
My lord, cheer up: our enemies are close,
And this sweet courage makes your supporters faint.
You promised the title of knight to our fore-son:
Take out your sword and duplicate it immediately.
Edward, kneel down.

KING HENRY VI:
Edouard Plantagenêt, arise knight;
And learn this lesson, draw your sword correctly.

PRINCE:
My gracious father, with your royal permission,
I will draw it as apparent to the crown,
And in this quarrel, use him to the death.

CLIFFORD:
Well, it's addressed like a prince.

Messenger:
Royal commanders, be ready:
Because with a band of thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick, supported by the Duke of York;
And in the cities, as they walk,
Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:
Darraign your fight, for they are at hand.

CLIFFORD:
I would like Your Highness to leave the field:
The queen is more successful when you are away.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Yes, my lord, and leave us to our fortune.

KING HENRY VI:
Well, it's also my fortune; so I'm going to stay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Let it be with the resolution to fight.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My royal father, encourage these noble lords
And comfort those who fight in your defense:
Draw out your sword, good father; shout “Saint George!”

EDWARD:
Now Henry is perjuring! Will you kneel for grace,
And put your diadem on my head;
Or wait for the deadly fortune of the field?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Come on, rate your servants, proud insulting boy!
It suits you to be so bold in terms
Before your sovereign and your lawful king?

EDWARD:
I am his king, and he must kneel;
I was adopted heir by his consent:
Since when has his oath been broken; because, as I understand it,
You who are king, even if he wears the crown,
Made him, by a new Act of Parliament,
To erase me and put his own son there.

CLIFFORD:
And the reason too:
Who should succeed the father if not the son?

RICHARD:
Are you there, butcher? Oh, I can't speak!

CLIFFORD:
Yes, crook, here I am to answer you,
Or anyone, he is the proudest of your kind.

RICHARD:
“You were the one who killed young Rutland, weren’t you?”

CLIFFORD:
Yes, and old York, and yet not satisfied.

RICHARD:
For the love of God, lords, give the signal to fight.

WARWICK:
What do you say, Henry, will you give up the crown?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Well, how, long-tongued Warwick! do you dare to speak?
When you and I met for the last time in Saint Alban,
Your legs served better than your hands.

WARWICK:
Then it was my turn to steal, and now it's your turn.

CLIFFORD:
You said so much before, and yet you ran away.

WARWICK:
“It wasn't your courage, Clifford, that made me leave.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, nor your manhood which dared to make you stay.

RICHARD:
Northumberland, I hold you with respect.
Stop the talks; because I can barely refrain
Running my big swollen heart
About this Clifford, this cruel child killer.

CLIFFORD:
I killed your father, you call him a child?

RICHARD:
Yes, like a coward and a treacherous coward,
As you killed our tender brother Rutland;
But before sunset, I will make you curse this act.

KING HENRY VI:
Finish with the words, my lords, and hear me speak.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
So defy them, or close your lips.

KING HENRY VI:
Please give no limits to my tongue:
I am a king and I have the privilege of speaking.

CLIFFORD:
My lord, the wound that caused this meeting here
Cannot be healed by words; so stay calm.

RICHARD:
So, executioner, draw your sword:
By him who made us all, I am resolved
that Clifford's manhood rests on his tongue.

EDWARD:
Say, Henry, do I have my right or not?
A thousand men broke their fast today,
I will never dine unless you give up the crown.

WARWICK:
If you deny, their blood on your head;
For York, in justice, puts on his armor.

PRINCE EDWARD:
If what Warwick says is true,
There is no harm, but everything is good.

RICHARD:
The one who had you, your mother is there;
Because, I know, you have your mother's language.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
But you are neither like your father nor your mother;
But like a filthy and deformed stigma,
Marked by the fates to be avoided,
Like poisonous toads or terrible lizard bites.

RICHARD:
Naples iron hidden with English gilding,
Whose father bears the title of king,
As if a channel should be called the sea,
Are you not ashamed, knowing where you came from,
To let your tongue detect your vile heart?

EDWARD:
A blade of straw was worth a thousand crowns,
So that this shameless callet knows herself.
Helen of Greece was far more beautiful than you,
Although your husband is Menelaus;
And Agamemnon's brother was never wrong
By this false woman, like this king by you.
His father delighted in the heart of France,
And he tamed the king, and brought down the dolphin;
And if it had been matched according to its condition,
He could have retained this glory to this day;
But when he took a beggar to his bed,
And I honored your poor father on his wedding day,
Even then, this sun prepared a shower for him,
This took his father's fortune out of France,
And he caused sedition on his crown at home.
For what has broached this tumult but your pride?
If you had been gentle, our title would still have slept;
And we, for pity of the sweet king,
We had postponed our claim to another age.

GEORGE:
But when we saw our sun make your spring,
And your summer did not bring us growth,
We lay the ax on your usurping root;
And although something knocked us to the edge,
Yet, know this, since we began to strike,
We'll never leave until we take you down,
Or bathed your growth with our warm bloods.

EDWARD:
And, in this resolution, I challenge you;
Not wanting any more conferences,
Since you refuse the gentle king to speak.
Sound the trumpets! let our bloody colors float!
And either victory or death.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Stay, Edward.

EDWARD:
No, argumentative, we will no longer stay:
These words will cost ten thousand lives today.
3KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Spent by toil, like runners by a race,
I lie down for a little while to breathe;
For the blows received and the numerous blows reimbursed,
I deprived my strong tendons of their strength,
And despite my needs, I must rest for a while.

EDWARD:
Smile, sweet heaven! or strike, brutal death!
For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is darkened.

WARWICK:
Well, my lord! What happened ? what hope of good?

GEORGE:
Our misfortune is a loss, our hope is only a sad despair;
Our ranks are broken, and ruin follows us:
What advice do you give yourself? where are we going to fly?

EDWARD:
Without boots, it's flight, they follow us with wings;
And we are weak and cannot avoid pursuit.

RICHARD:
Ah, Warwick, why did you withdraw?
The thirsty earth has drunk your brother's blood,
Approached with the steel point of Clifford's spear;
And in the throes of death he cried:
Like a mournful noise heard from afar,
“Warwick, revenge!” brother, avenge my death!
So, under the bellies of their horses,
It stained their fetlocks in its steaming blood,
The noble gentleman has given up the ghost.

WARWICK:
So let the earth be drunk with our blood:
I will kill my horse, because I will not steal.
Why do we stay here like tender-hearted women,
We lament our losses, while the enemy rages;
And look, as if the tragedy
Were they played in jest by fake actors?
Here, on my knees, I make a vow to God above,
I'll never stop, I'll never stand still,
Until death closes my eyes
Or fortune gave me a measure of vengeance.

EDWARD:
O Warwick, I bend my knee with thine;
And with this vow, chain my soul to yours!
And before my knee rises from the cold face of the earth,
I cast my hands, my eyes, my heart towards you,
You who established and removed kings,
I beg you, if they want it, it works
That for my enemies this body must be prey,
Yet so that your bronze gates of heaven may be opened,
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!
Now, lords, take your leave until we meet again,
Wherever it is, in heaven or on earth.

RICHARD:
Brother, give me your hand; and, kind Warwick,
Let me kiss you in my tired arms:
I who have never cried, I now melt with misfortune
This winter should thus cut off our spring.

WARWICK:
Far, far! Once again, sweet lords, farewell.

GEORGE:
But let's all rally to our troops,
And give them permission to fly who will not stay;
And call them pillars that will stand before us;
And if we prosper, promise them such rewards
How the winners wear the Olympic games:
This may give courage to their trembling breasts;
Because there is still hope of life and victory.
Don't delay any longer, make sure we stay.
3KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Now, Clifford, I have chosen you alone:
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,
And this for Rutland; both dedicated to revenge,
Would you be surrounded by a wall of bronze?

CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, I am here alone with you:
This is the hand that stabbed your father York;
And this is the hand that killed your brother Rutland;
And here is the heart that triumphs in their death
And rejoice those hands that killed your father and your brother
To perform the same on yourself;
And then, be yours!

RICHARD:
No, Warwick, choose another pursuit;
For I myself will hunt this wolf to the death.
3KING HENRY VI

KING HENRY VI:
This battle is going on like the morning war,
When the dying clouds fight against the growing light,
At what time the shepherd, blowing his nails,
I can neither call it perfect day or night.
Now swing it this way, like a mighty sea
Forced by the tide to fight against the wind;
Now he swings it this way, like the same sea
Forced to give up by the fury of the wind:
Sometimes it is the flood that prevails, then the wind;
Now one is the best, then another is the best;
Both striving to be victorious, chest to chest,
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
The same goes for this fallen war.
Here, on this molehill, I will sit.
To whom God wills, there be victory!
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
Scolded me during battle; both swearing
They thrive best when I'm there.
If I were dead! if the good will of God was;
For what is there in this world but sorrow and misfortune?
Oh my God! I think it was a happy life,
To be no better than a simple married man;
Sit on a hill, like I do now,
To carve dials in a picturesque way, point by point,
So to see the minutes how they unfold,
How many complete the hour;
How many hours are in the day;
How many days will the year end;
How many years can a mortal live.
When this is known, then divide the times:
So many hours must I tend my flock;
So many hours must I take my rest;
So many hours must I contemplate;
I need so many hours of sport;
So many days have my sheep been with their young;
So many weeks before the poor fools understood:
So many years before I sheared the fleece:
So minutes, hours, days, months and years,
Passed to the end, they were created,
Would bring gray hairs to a quiet grave.
Ah, what a life it was! how nice! so pretty!
Does not give hawthorn a softer shade
To the shepherds who look at their stupid sheep,
Than a rich embroidered canopy
To kings who fear betrayal from their subjects?
Oh, yes, that's true; It’s a thousand times more true.
And to conclude, the shepherd's curdled milk,
His cold, fine drink out of its leather bottle.
His usual sleep in the shade of a cool tree,
All he enjoys safely and sweetly,
Is far beyond the delicacies of a prince,
Its sparkling meats in a golden cup,
His body lying in a curious bed,
When worry, distrust and betrayal await him.

Son:
I will blow the wind that benefits no one.
This man I killed in hand-to-hand combat,
May be possessed of a hoard of crowns;
And I might take them away from him now,
May still before night deliver both my life and them
To another man, as this dead man does to me.
Who is it? Oh my God! it's my father's face,
Who, in this conflict, I killed without knowing it.
O heavy times, generating such events!
The king took me out of London;
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
Came from York, urged by his master;
And I, who in his hands I received my life, he
I mourned him with my hands.
Forgive me, God, I didn't know what I had done!
And sorry, father, because I didn't know you!
My tears will erase these bloody marks;
And no more words until they are full.

KING HENRY VI:
O pitiful spectacle! O bloody times!
While the lions wage war and fight for their dens,
Poor, harmless lambs bear their enmity.
Cry, wretch, I will help you tear for tear;
And may our hearts and our eyes, like the civil war,
Be blind with tears and break down overwhelmed with sorrow.

Father:
You who resisted me so valiantly,
Give me your gold, if you have any:
Because I bought it at a hundred blows.
But let me see: is this the face of our enemy?
Ah, no, no, no, he's my only son!
Ah, my boy, if there is any life left in you,
Look up! see, see what showers come,
Blown by the windy storm of my heart,
On your words, which kill my eyes and my heart!
O pity, my God, this miserable century!
What stratagems, what fall, what butchery,
Wrong, mutinous and unnatural,
This deadly feud breeds every day!
O my boy, your father gave you life too soon,
And he deprived you of your life too late!

KING HENRY VI:
Woe above woe! sorrow is more than ordinary sorrow!
O may my death stop these merciless acts!
O pity, pity, sweet heaven, pity!
The red rose and the white one are on her face,
The fatal colors of our struggling houses:
The one to whom his purple blood closely resembles;
The other, his pale cheeks, it seems to me, presents:
Wither one rose and let the other bloom;
If you struggle, a thousand lives will disappear.

Son:
How is my mother doing for the death of a father
Face me and never be satisfied!

Father:
How is my wife for the massacre of my son
Shed seas of tears and never be satisfied!

KING HENRY VI:
How will the country face these terrible odds?
Think ill of the king and be dissatisfied!

Son:
Has a son ever regretted the death of a father so much?

Father:
Has there ever been a father who deplored his son so much?

KING HENRY VI:
Was a king ever so distressed by the misfortune of his subjects?
Your grief is great; mine ten times more.

Son:
I'll take you from here, where I can cry my heart out.

Father:
My weapons will be your shroud;
My heart, sweet boy, will be your sepulchre,
For your image will never leave my heart;
My sighing chest will be your funeral bell;
And your father will be so obsequious,
Even for your loss, having no more,
As Priam was to all his valiant sons.
I will carry you from here; and let them fight this will,
Because I killed where I should not have killed.

KING HENRY VI:
Men with sad hearts, overwhelmed with cares,
Here sits a king more terrible than you.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Fly, father, fly! because all your friends have fled,
And Warwick gets angry like an angry bull:
Far! because death pursues us.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Come up, my lord; to Berwick post tomorrow:
Edward and Richard, like two greyhounds
Having in sight the fearsome flying hare,
With fiery eyes sparkling with anger,
And bloody steel seized in their wrathful hands,
Are by our side; and therefore therefore a hand.

EXECUTE:
Far! because vengeance accompanies them:
No, don't reproach, do it quickly;
Or come later: I will leave before.

KING HENRY VI:
No, take me with you, my good and sweet Exeter:
Not that I'm afraid to stay, but I like to go
Where the queen wants. Before; far!
3KING HENRY VI

CLIFFORD:
Here my candle goes out; yeah, here he dies,
Which, while it lasted, enlightened King Henry.
O Lancaster, I fear your overthrow
More than my body separates from my soul!
My love and my fear have made many friends with you;
And now I'm falling, your hard mixture is melting.
Belittling Henry, strengthening the unfortunate York,
Ordinary people swarm like summer flies;
And where do the midges fly if not towards the sun?
And who shines now, if not Henry's enemies?
O Phoebus, have you never given your consent
So that Phaethon stops your fiery steeds,
Your burning car never burned the earth!
And, Henry, if you had influenced as kings should,
Or like your father and his father did,
Yielding no ground to the house of York,
Never then had they appeared like summer flies;
Me and ten thousand people in this unhappy kingdom
Had left no widow to mourn our death;
And you, that day, you kept your chair in peace.
For what do we cherish but the sweet air?
And what makes thieves bold, if not too lenient?
Complaints are useless, and my wounds are incurable;
No means to fly, nor strength to maintain flight:
The enemy is merciless and will have no mercy;
For from them I deserved no pity.
The air entered my mortal wounds,
And a lot of bloodshed makes me pass out.
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
I stabbed your fathers' chests, I split my chest.

EDWARD:
Now let's breathe, lords: luck invites us to take a break,
And soften the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
Some troops pursue the bloody queen,
This led Henry calm, although he was a king,
Like a sail, filled with an ominous gust,
Order an Argosy to stem the waves.
But do you think, lords, that Clifford ran away with them?

WARWICK:
No, it's impossible for him to escape,
Because, even if in front of his face I say the words
Your brother Richard marked it for the grave:
And wherever he is, he's probably dead.

EDWARD:
Whose soul is it that takes a heavy leave?

RICHARD:
A deathly moan, like the departure of life and death.

EDWARD:
See who it is: and now the battle is over,
Whether friend or foe, let him be used gently.

RICHARD:
Revoke this judgment of mercy, for it is Clifford;
Who is not happy to have cut the branch
By pruning Rutland when its leaves were growing,
But I put his murderous knife to the root
From which this tender jet gently springs,
I mean our princely father, the Duke of York.

WARWICK:
From the gates of York, collect your head,
Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;
Instead, let this populate the room:
We must respond measure by measure.

EDWARD:
Bring this deadly owl into our house,
That nothing sang but death for us and ours:
Now death will stop its mournful and menacing sound,
And his tongue of ill omen will speak no more.

WARWICK:
I think he doesn't quite understand.
Speak, Clifford, do you know who is speaking to you?
Dark and cloudy death eclipses its rays of life,
And he doesn't see us or hear what we say.

RICHARD:
Oh, would he! and maybe that's what he does:
It's just his policy of counterfeiting,
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
Which he gave to our father at the time of his death.

GEORGE:
If you think so, antagonize him with hasty words.

RICHARD:
Clifford, ask for mercy and get no mercy.

EDWARD:
Clifford, repent in unnecessary penance.

WARWICK:
Clifford, make excuses for your mistakes.

GEORGE:
While we design terrible tortures for your sins.

RICHARD:
You loved York, and I am York's son.

EDWARD:
You took pity on Rutland; I will pity you.

GEORGE:
Where is Captain Margaret, for closure now?

WARWICK:
They're laughing at you, Clifford: swear like you used to.

RICHARD:
What, not an oath? no, then the world becomes harsh
When Clifford can't spare his friends an oath.
I know from this that he is dead; and, through my soul,
If this right hand could buy two hours of life,
That despite everything I could insult him,
This hand should cut it, and with the
give blood
Suffocate the wicked whose insatiable thirst
York and young Rutland could not satisfy.

WARWICK:
Yes, but he is dead: remove the traitor's head,
And raise him up in the place where your father is.
And now towards London with a triumphant march,
There to be crowned Royal King of England:
From where will Warwick cut the sea to France,
And ask Lady Bona your queen:
So you will divide these two lands together;
And having France as a friend, you will not fear
The scattered enemy who hopes to rise again;
For although they cannot sting greatly to hurt,
Yet, be careful that they buzz to offend your ears.
I will see the coronation first;
And then in Brittany I will cross the sea,
To carry out this marriage, may it please my lord.

EDWARD:
Even if you wish it, sweet Warwick, so be it;
For on your shoulder I build my seat,
And I will never undertake the thing
Where your advice and consent are lacking.
Richard, I will make you Duke of Gloucester,
And George, of Clarence: Warwick, like ourselves,
He will do and undo as he pleases.

RICHARD:
Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
Because the Duchy of Gloucester is too worrying.

WARWICK:
But that's a stupid observation:
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now in London,
To see these honors in possession.
3KING HENRY VI

First goalkeeper:
Under this thick brake, we will wrap ourselves;
For soon the deer will come across this plain;
And in this secret we will take our stand,
Shoot down the main of all the deer.

Second goalkeeper:
I'll stay over the hill so the two can shoot.

First goalkeeper:
This cannot be; the sound of your crossbow
This will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
We are both here and aim for the best:
And, because time will not seem tedious,
I'll tell you what happened to me one day
In this place where we now intend to stand.

Second goalkeeper:
Here is a man; let's stay until it has passed.

KING HENRY VI:
From Scotland I am stolen, even for pure love,
To greet my own land with my pious gaze.
No, Harry, Harry, this is not your land;
Your place is filled, your scepter has been taken from you,
Your balm has been washed with which you have been anointed:
No bent knee will call you Caesar from now on,
No humble pretender presses forward to speak for good,
No, no one comes to ask you for compensation;
Because how can I help them, and not myself?

First goalkeeper:
Yes, here is a deer whose skin is a keeper's prize:
He is the former king; let's grab it.

KING HENRY VI:
Let me embrace you, bitter adversity,
Because the wise say that this is the wisest solution.

Second goalkeeper:
Why should we linger? let us lay our hands on him.

First goalkeeper:
Abstain for a moment; we'll hear a little more.

KING HENRY VI:
My queen and my son went to France to ask for help;
And, as I hear it, the great Commander Warwick
Left there, to implore the sister of the King of France
Marry Edward: if this news is true,
Poor queen and son, your work is only wasted;
For Warwick is a subtle speaker,
And Lewis, a prince, quickly won with moving words.
By this story, Margaret can then win him;
Because she is a woman to be pitied:
His sighs will make a drum in his chest;
Her tears will pierce a heart of marble;
The tiger will be gentle while he cries;
And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
To hear and see her complaints, her briny tears.
Yes, but she came to beg, Warwick to give;
She, on her left side, begging for help for Henry,
He, on his right, asks for a wife for Edward.
She cries and says her Henry is deposed;
He smiles and says his Edward is settled;
That she, the poor wretch, can no longer speak because of grief;
While Warwick tells his title, smoothes out the errors,
Deduce arguments of great force,
And in conclusion he wins the king from her,
With his sister's promise, and what else,
Strengthen and support King Edward Square.
O Marguerite, so it will be; and you, poor soul,
You are then abandoned, since you left alone!

Second goalkeeper:
Say, what are you to talk about kings and queens?

KING HENRY VI:
More than I seem, and less than I was born to do:
A man at least, because without that I would not be one;
And men can talk about kings, and why not me?

Second goalkeeper:
Yes, but you talk like you're a king.

KING HENRY VI:
Well, that's what I think; and that's enough.

Second goalkeeper:
But if you are king, where is your crown?

KING HENRY VI:
My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
Not adorned with diamonds and Indian stones,
Nor to see: my crown is called content:
A crown that kings rarely enjoy.

Second goalkeeper:
Well, if you are a king crowned with contentment,
Your crown is happy and you must be happy
To accompany us; because as we think,
You are the king that King Edward deposed;
And we, his subjects, took the oath of allegiance
Will apprehend you as his enemy.

KING HENRY VI:
But have you never sworn and broken an oath?

Second goalkeeper:
No, never such an oath; and won't do it now either.

KING HENRY VI:
Where did you live when I was king of England?

Second goalkeeper:
Here, in this country, where we stay now.

KING HENRY VI:
I was anointed king at the age of nine months;
My father and my grandfather were kings,
And you have been true sworn subjects for me:
And tell me, have you not broken your oaths?

First goalkeeper:
No;
For we were subjects, but while you were king.

KING HENRY VI:
Why am I dead? am I not breathing a man?
Ah! simple men, you don't know what you swear!
Listen, while I blow this feather from my face,
And as the air blows it to me again,
Obeying my wind when I blow,
And give in to another when he blows,
Always commanded by the greatest gust;
Such is the lightness of you, ordinary men.
But do not break your oaths; because of this sin
My sweet supplication will not make you guilty.
Go where you want, the king will be in charge;
And be kings, command, and I will obey.

First goalkeeper:
We are true subjects of the king, King Edward.

KING HENRY VI:
So would you be with Henry again,
If he sat like King Edward.

First goalkeeper:
We charge you, in the name of God and the king,
To accompany us to the officers.

KING HENRY VI:
In the name of God, lead; the name of your king be obeyed:
And what God wills, let your king execute it;
And what he wants, I humbly yield.
3KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Brother of Gloucester, in the field of Saint Alban
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was killed.
His lands then seized by the conqueror:
His goal now is to regain possession of these lands;
What we, in justice, cannot deny,
Because in the quarrel of the House of York
The worthy gentleman lost his life.

GLOCKESTER:
Your Highness will do well to grant his request;
It was a dishonor to refuse him.

KING EDWARD IV:
It was nothing less; but I'm still going to take a break.

GLOCKESTER:

CLARENCE:

GLOCKESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Widow, we will consider your request;
And come another time to know our spirit.

LADY GREY:
Most gracious lord, I cannot bear delay:
May it please Your Highness to resolve me now;
And what is your pleasure, will satisfy me.

GLOCKESTER:

CLARENCE:

GLOCKESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
How many children do you have, widow? tell me.

CLARENCE:

GLOCKESTER:

LADY GRAY:
Third, my most gracious lord.

GLOCKESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
“It would be a shame if they lost their father’s lands.

LADY GRAY:
Be pitiful, dreadful lord, and grant it then.

KING EDWARD IV:
Lords, give us leave: I will try the wit of this widow.

GLOCKESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now tell me, lady, do you love your children?

LADY GRAY:
Yes, full as dear as I love myself.

KING EDWARD IV:
And wouldn't you do much to do them good?

LADY GRAY:
To do them good, I would suffer harm.

KING EDWARD IV:
So recover your husband's land, to do them good.

LADY GRAY:
This is why I came to Your Majesty.

KING EDWARD IV:
I will tell you how to get these lands.

LADY GREY:
So will you bind me to the service of Your Highness.

KING EDWARD IV:
What service will you do me if I do them?

LADY GRAY:
What you order is for me to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
But you will accept exceptions for my benefit.

LADY GRAY:
No, gracious lord, except I can't do it.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, but you can do what I want to ask you.

LADY GREY:
Well, then I will do as your grace commands.

GLOCKESTER:

CLARENCE:

LADY GRAY:
Why stop my lord, shall I not hear my task?

KING EDWARD IV:
An easy task; it is only to love a king.

LADY GREY:
It will soon be done, because I am a subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
Well, I'll give you your husband's land for free.

LADY GRAY:
I take my leave with a thousand thanks.

GLOCKESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
But stay you, these are the fruits of love, I mean.

LADY GRAY:
I mean the fruits of love, my kind lord.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, but I fear myself, in another sense.
What love, do you think, am I so eager to obtain?

LADY GRAY:
My love unto death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
This love that virtue demands and grants.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, my word, I wasn't talking about such love.

LADY GREY:
Well, then you don't mean what I thought.

KING EDWARD IV:
But now you can partly perceive my mind.

LADY GRAY:
My mind will never grant what I perceive
Your Highness aims, if I aim well.

KING EDWARD IV:
To tell you clearly, I intend to sleep with you.

LADY GRAY:
To tell you clearly, I would rather stay in prison.

KING EDWARD IV:
Well, then you won't have your husband's land.

LADY GREY:
Well, then my honesty will be my dowry;
Because because of this loss, I will not buy them.

KING EDWARD IV:
This is where you are doing your children considerable harm.

LADY GRAY:
Here, Your Highness is wronging them and me.
But, mighty lord, this joyful inclination
This doesn't match the sadness of my costume:
Please return me with “yes” or “no”.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, if you want to answer “yes” to my request;
No, if you say “no” to my request.

LADY GRAY:
So no, my lord. My trial is over.

GLOCKESTER:

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:

LADY GRAY:
Better said than done, my gracious lord:
I'm a subject worthy of joking,
But far from being fit to be sovereign.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sweet widow, by my condition I swear to you
I only speak what my soul wants;
And that is to say, take advantage of you for my love.

LADY GRAY:
And that's more than I'll give in to:
I know I'm too bad to be your queen,
And yet too beautiful to be your concubine.

KING EDWARD IV:
You quibble, widow: I meant, my queen.

LADY GREY:
“It would upset your Grace, my sons should call you father.

KING EDWARD IV:
No more than when my daughters call you mother.
You are a widow and you have children;
And, by the mother of God, I, being only a bachelor,
Have others: well, it's a happy thing
Being the father of several sons.
Don't answer anymore, because you will be my queen.

GLOCKESTER:

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:
Brothers, think about the conversation we both had.

GLOCKESTER:
This does not please the widow, because she looks very sad.

KING EDWARD IV:
You will find it strange that I am marrying him.

CLARENCE:
To whom, my lord?

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, Clarence, for myself.

GLOCKESTER:
It would be at least a ten-day wonder.

CLARENCE:
It's one day longer than a wonder lasts.

GLOCKESTER:
The wonder is all the more extreme.

KING EDWARD IV:
Well, joke, my brothers: I can tell you both
Her request is granted for her husband's lands.

Noble:
My gracious lord, Henry, your enemy is taken,
And I have brought your prisoner to the gate of your palace.

KING EDWARD IV:
Make sure he gets transported to the Tower:
And let us go, brothers, to the man who took him away,
To the question of his apprehension.
Widow, go ahead. Lords, use it honorably.

GLOCKESTER:
Yes, Edward will use women honorably.
Would he be exhausted, marrow, bones and all,
So that from his loins no branch full of hope can spring,
To cross me from the golden time that I seek!
And yet, between the desire of my soul and me...
Lecherous Edward's Title Buried...
Clarence, Henry and his son young Edward,
And all the unexpected outcomes of their bodies,
To take their rooms, before I can take my place:
Cold premeditation for my words!
Well, then, I only dream of sovereignty;
Like one who stands on a promontory,
And sees a distant shore where he would walk,
Wishing his foot to be equal to his eye,
And from there he rebukes the sea that divides him,
Saying, he will load it dry to do what he wants:
So I wish for the crown, being so far away;
Then I rebuke the means that prevent me;
And so I say, I will cut the causes,
Flattering myself with impossibilities.
My eye is too keen, my heart races too much,
Unless my hand and strength can match them.
Well, let's say there is no kingdom for Richard then;
What other pleasure can the world offer itself?
I will make my paradise on the knees of a lady,
And decorate my body with cheerful ornaments,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and my looks.
O miserable thought! and more improbable
Than accomplish twenty golden crowns!
Well, love forgave me in my mother's womb:
And, for I should not mind her gentle laws,
She corrupted fragile nature with bribes,
To shrink my arm like a withered shrub;
To make an envious mountain on my back,
Where is the deformity to mock my body;
To shape my unevenly sized legs;
To disproportion myself in every way,
Like chaos, or a little unlicked bear
It doesn't feel like the dam.
And am I therefore a man to be loved?
O monstrous fault, to entertain such a thought!
So, since this land brings me no joy,
But order, check, bear such
As I am a better person than I am,
I will make my paradise a dream on the crown,
And while I live, to account for this world but hell,
Until my deformed trunk which carries this head
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
And yet I don't know how to get the crown,
Many lives stand between me and home:
And I, like someone lost in a thorny wood,
Who tears thorns and is torn with thorns,
Seeking a path and turning away from it;
Not knowing how to find the outdoors,
But I'm working desperately to find out,--
Tormenting myself to catch the English crown:
And from this torment I will free myself,
Or cut my way with a damn axe.
Well I can smile and kill while I smile,
And shout “Glad” to what afflicts my heart,
And I wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
And frames my face on all occasions.
I will drown more sailors than the mermaid;
I will kill more spectators than the basilisk;
I will play the speaker as well as Nestor,
Deceive more slyly than Ulysses could,
And, like an Otherwise, take another Troy.
I can add colors to the chameleon,
Shapeshift with Proteus for benefits,
And put the murderer Machiavelli in school.
Can I do this without being able to get a crown?
But if it was any further, I would rip it out.
3KING HENRY VI

KING LEWIS XI:
Beautiful Queen of England, worthy Marguerite,
Sit down with us: this does not suit your state
And birth, so that you are standing while Lewis is sitting.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
No, powerful king of France: now Marguerite
I must raise the sail and learn to serve for a while
Where kings rule. I was, I must admit,
The Queen of the great Albion in the golden days of yesteryear:
But now chance has trodden my title,
And with dishonor I lay down on the ground;
Where I must take my place for my fortune,
And I conform to my humble seat.

KING LEWIS XI:
Why, let us say, fair queen, where does this deep despair come from?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
For a cause that fills my eyes with tears
And shut my tongue, while my heart is drowned in worries.

KING LEWIS XI:
No matter what, always be like yourself,
And sit beside us:
Don't give your neck
To the yoke of fortune, but let your spirit be intrepid
Always ride in triumph over all misfortunes.
Be frank, Queen Margaret, and tell your sorrow;
It will be attenuated if France can give in.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
These gracious words revive my falling thoughts
And let my silent sorrows speak.
Now then, let the noble Lewis know,
This Henry, sole possessor of my love,
Is it from a king who became a banished man,
And forced to live in Scotland in abandonment;
While the proud and ambitious Edward Duke of York
Usurps royal title and seat
Of the true and rightful king of England.
That's why I, poor Margaret,
With this, my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
I have come to implore your just and legitimate help;
And if you let us down, all our hope is lost:
Scotland is willing to help, but it cannot help;
Our people and our peers are both misled,
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
And, as you see, we are in a difficult situation.

KING LEWIS XI:
Renowned queen, with patience calms the storm,
While we think of a way to end it.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
The longer we stay, the stronger our enemy becomes.

KING LEWIS XI:
The longer I stay, the more I will help you.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Oh, but impatience awaits true sorrow.
And see where the begetter of my sorrow comes from!

KING LEWIS XI:
Why is he boldly approaching our presence?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.

KING LEWIS XI:
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings you to France?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Yes, now a second storm begins to arise;
For it is he who moves the wind and the tide.

WARWICK:
Of the worthy Edward, king of Albion,
My lord and sovereign, and your sworn friend,
I come, with kindness and sincere love,
First, salute your royal person;
And then want a friendship league;
And finally, to confirm this friendship
With a nuptial knot, if you deign to grant
This virtuous Lady Bona, your beautiful sister,
With the King of England in legal marriage.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:

WARWICK:

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
Before responding to Warwick. His request
Didn't come from Edward's honest, well-meaning love,
But by deception brought about by necessity;
For how can tyrants safely rule their house,
Unless abroad they buy a big wedding ring?
To prove him a tyrant, this reason may be enough,
That Henry still lives: but if he were dead,
Yet here is Prince Edward, the son of King Henry.
Listen then, Lewis, that by this league and this marriage
You do not take advantage of your danger and your dishonor;
For even if the usurpers dominate the rule for a while,
Yet the heavens are just, and time removes injustice.

WARWICK:
Insulting Marguerite!

PRINCE EDWARD:
And why not queen?

WARWICK:
Because your father Henri usurped;
And you are no more prince than she is queen.

OXFORD:
Then Warwick cancels the great John of Gaunt,
Which subjugated the greater part of Spain;
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry IV,
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
And, after this wise prince Henry V,
Who by his prowess conquered all of France:
From these our Henry descends in a straight line.

WARWICK:
Oxford, how is it, in this sweet speech,
You haven't told how Henry the Sixth lost
Everything Henry the Fifth had gotten?
It seems to me that these French peers should smile.
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
Sixty-two years old; a stupid time
To make a prescription for the value of a kingdom.

OXFORD:
Why, Warwick, can you speak against your liege,
Whom you obeyed for thirty-six years,
And not betray your treason by blushing?

WARWICK:
Can Oxford, which has already closed the right,
Now to close the lie with a pedigree?
Damage ! leave Henry and call Edward king.

OXFORD:
Call him my king by whose injurious destiny
My elder brother, Lord Aubrey Vere,
Was he killed? and more, my father,
Even in the fall of his sweet years,
When nature brought him to death's door?
No, Warwick, no; while life supports this arm,
This arm supports the House of Lancaster.

WARWICK:
And I the house of York.

KING LEWIS XI:
Queen Margaret, Prince Edward and Oxford,
Guarantee, at our request, to withdraw,
While I use another conference with Warwick.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
God grant that Warwick's words do not bewitch him!

KING LEWIS XI:
Now Warwick, tell me, even on your conscience,
Is Edward your true king? because I was disgusting
To bond with him who was not rightfully chosen.

WARWICK:
Thereupon I pledge my credit and my honor.

KING LEWIS XI:
But is he lovable in the eyes of the people?

WARWICK:
Especially since Henry was unhappy.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then further, all dissimulation aside,
Tell me in truth the measure of his love
To our sister Bona.

WARWICK:
Such it seems
How fitting for a monarch like him.
I myself have often heard him say and swear
That his love was an eternal plant,
Whose root was fixed in the soil of virtue,
The leaves and fruits maintained by the sun of beauty,
Free from envy, but not from disdain,
Unless Lady Bona abandons her pain.

KING LEWIS XI:
Now, my sister, let us listen to your firm determination.

BONA:
Your grant, or your refusal, will be mine:
Yet I admit that often before this day,
When I have heard of your king's desert,
My ear has tempted judgment toward desire.

KING LEWIS XI:
So, Warwick, thus: our sister will be Edward's;
And now the articles will immediately be drawn
Touching the joint that your king must make,
Which with its dowry will be in counterbalance.
Come closer, Queen Margaret, and witness
This Bona will be the wife of the King of England.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, but not to the King of England.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Deceptive Warwick! it was your device
By this alliance to annul my trial:
Before you arrived, Lewis was Henry's friend.

KING LEWIS XI:
And he is still friends with him and Margaret:
But if your title to the crown is weak,
As Edward's good success shows,
So that's just one reason for me to be released
Help I promised late.
Yet you will have all the kindness from me
That your heritage demands and that mine can yield.

WARWICK:
Henry now lives at ease in Scotland,
Where having nothing, he can lose nothing.
And as for yourself, our former queen,
You have a father capable of supporting you;
And it's better that you troubled him than France.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
Proud smuggler and shooter of kings!
I will not leave until, with my words and my tears,
Both full of truth, I show King Lewis
Your devious means of transportation and the false love of your lord;
For you are both birds of the same feather.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, this is a message for us or for you.

Job:

OXFORD:
I like that our beautiful queen and mistress
He smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No, notice how Lewis stamps his feet, even though he was annoyed:
I hope everything goes well.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, what's your news? and yours, beautiful queen?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Mine, as they fill my heart with unexpected joys.

WARWICK:
Mine, full of sorrow and discontent of the heart.

KING LEWIS XI:
What! Did your king marry Lady Grey!
And now, to appease your falsehood and his,
Send me a paper to persuade me to be patient?
Is this the alliance he seeks with France?
Will he dare to look down on us like this?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
I have already said this to Your Majesty:
This proves Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.

WARWICK:
King Lewis, I protest here, in view of heaven,
And by the hope I have of heavenly happiness,
That I am clear of this misdeed of Edward,
No longer my king, because he dishonors me,
But especially himself, if he could see his shame.
Did I forget that near York's house
My father died prematurely?
Did I let the abuse inflicted on my niece slide?
Did I impale him with the royal crown?
Did I put Henry from his native country, right?
And am I finally overcome with shame?
Shame on himself! because my merit is an honor:
And to repair my lost honor for him,
Here I give up on him and return to Henry.
My noble queen, let old grudges pass,
And now I am your true servant:
I will avenge his wrong with Lady Bona,
And replant Henry in his old state.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Warwick, these words transformed my hatred into love;
And I forgive and completely forget old faults,
And the joy that you become the friend of King Henry.

WARWICK:
So much his friend, yes, his sincere friend,
That, if King Lewis deigns to provide us
With a few bands of chosen soldiers,
I undertake to land them on our shores
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
It is not his new wife who will help him:
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
It is very likely that it will fall from him now,
To correspond more to wanton lust than to honor,
Or that for the strength and security of our country.

BONA:
Dear brother, how will Bona take revenge
But by your help to this queen in distress?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Famous prince, how will poor Henri live,
Unless you save him from terrible despair?

BONA:
My quarrel and that of this Queen of England are one.

WARWICK:
And mine, fair lady Bona, joins yours.

KING LEWIS XI:
And mine with his, yours and Margaret's.
That's why I am finally firmly resolved
You will have help.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Let me humbly thank you for all of this at once.

KING LEWIS XI:
So, messenger of England, return to post,
And tell false Edward, your pretended king,
Let Lewis from France send maskers
To enjoy it with him and his new wife:
You see what has happened, go in fear of your king.

BONA:
Tell him, hoping that he will become a widower soon,
I will carry the willow garland for him.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Tell him my weeds of mourning are laid aside,
And I'm ready to put on some armor.

WARWICK:
Tell him for me that he hurt me,
That's why I'm going to remove him from his crown shortly.
Here's your reward: go.

KING LEWIS XI:
But, Warwick,
You and Oxford, with five thousand men,
Will cross the seas and propose a false battle to Edward;
And, depending on the occasion, this noble queen
And the prince will follow with a new supply.
Yet, before you go, but answer me one doubt,
What pledge do we have of your firm fidelity?

WARWICK:
This will ensure my constant loyalty,
That if our queen and this young prince agree,
I will join my eldest daughter and my joy
To him immediately in the holy covenants.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Yes, I agree and thank you for your motion.
Son Edward, she is just and virtuous,
So don't delay, give Warwick your hand;
And, from your hand, your irrevocable faith,
That only Warwick's daughter will be yours.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Yes, I accept it, because she deserves it;
And there, to pronounce my wish, I give my hand.

KING LEWIS XI:
Why do we stay now? These soldiers will be raised,
And you, Lord Bourbon, our great admiral,
I will bring them with our royal fleet.
I long for Edward to fall by chance from the war,
For a mocking marriage with a lady from France.

WARWICK:
I came from Edward as ambassador,
But I return his sworn and mortal enemy:
The question of marriage was the charge he entrusted to me,
But a terrible war will answer his request.
Didn't he have anyone but me to make a stale deal?
Then no one but me will turn his joke into sorrow.
I was the leader who raised him to the crown,
And I'll be the leader to bring him down again:
Not that I pity Henry's misery,
But seek revenge for Edward's mockery.
3KING HENRY VI

GLOCKESTER:
Now tell me, brother Clarence, what do you think
About this new marriage with Lady Grey?
Didn't our brother make a good choice?

CLARENCE:
Alas, you know, France is far from here;
How could he stay until Warwick returned?

SOMERSET:
Gentlemen, refrain from this speech; here is the king.

GLOCKESTER:
And his well-chosen wife.

CLARENCE:
I would like to tell him clearly what I think.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother of Clarence, our choice is like you,
That you remain thoughtful, half displeased?

CLARENCE:
As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
Who are so weak in courage and judgment
That they will not be offended by our abuse.

KING EDWARD IV:
Suppose they get offended for no reason,
It's just Lewis and Warwick: I'm Edward,
Your king and that of Warwick, and must have my will.

GLOCKESTER:
And you will have your will, because our king:
However, a hasty marriage rarely produces good results.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, Brother Richard, are you also offended?

GLOCKESTER:
Not me :
No, God forbid I wish they were apart
Which God has brought together; yes, and it was a shame
To break those who unite their yoke so well.

KING EDWARD IV:
Putting aside your contempt and your antipathies,
Tell me a reason why Lady Gray
I shouldn't become my wife and the Queen of England.
And you too, Somerset and Montague,
Say freely what you think.

CLARENCE:
So here is my opinion: that King Lewis
Becomes your enemy, to make fun of him
About Lady Bona's marriage.

GLOCKESTER:
And Warwick, doing as you entrusted him,
Is now disgraced by this new marriage.

KING EDWARD IV:
What if Lewis and Warwick were appeased
By an invention that I can conceive?

ASSEMBLY :
However, having joined France in such an alliance
Would it have strengthened our Commonwealth
“Against foreign storms more than any home-made marriage.”

HASTING:
Why, Montague doesn't know this about himself
Is England safe, if that is true in itself?

ASSEMBLY :
But it's all the safer when we're back with France.

HASTING:
It's better to use France than to trust France:
Let's be back with God and with the seas
Which he gave for impregnable enclosure,
And with their help, we only defend ourselves;
In them and in us lies our security.

CLARENCE:
For this speech alone, Lord Hastings deserves
Have Lord Hungerford's heir.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, what about that? it was my will and my concession;
And this time, my will will be law.

GLOCKESTER:
And yet it seems to me that your grace has not done well,
To give to the heiress and daughter of Lord Scales
To the brother of your beloved wife;
It would have suited me or Clarence better:
But in your wife, you bury fraternity.

CLARENCE:
Otherwise you would not have given the heir
From Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
And let your brothers go elsewhere quickly.

KING EDWARD IV:
Alas, poor Clarence! is this for a woman
That you are unhappy? I will provide you.

CLARENCE:
By choosing for yourself, you have exercised your judgment,
Which being superficial, you give me permission
Play the role of broker on my own behalf;
And that's why I plan to leave you shortly.

KING EDWARD IV:
Leave me, or wait, Edward will be king,
And not be bound by his brother's will.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My lords, before it pleases his majesty
To elevate my state to the title of queen,
Do me right, and you all must confess
That I was not of ignoble origin;
And those more wicked than me have had a fortune.
But as this title honors me and mine,
So your aversion, to whom I would please,
It obscures my joys with danger and sorrow.

KING EDWARD IV:
My love, don't make fun of their frowns:
What danger or sorrow can befall you,
As long as Edward is your constant friend,
And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
No, who they will obey and love you too,
Unless they seek hatred from me;
And if they do, I'll keep you safe,
And they will feel the vengeance of my anger.

GLOCKESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, messenger, what letters or what news
Of France?

Job:
My sovereign liege, no letters; and a few words,
But like me, without your special forgiveness,
Don't you dare tell.

KING EDWARD IV:
Come on, we forgive you: so, in short,
Tell me their words as faithfully as you can guess them.
What response does King Lewis make to our letters?

Job:
When I left, these were his words:
"Go tell the false Edward, your supposed king,
Let Lewis from France send maskers
To enjoy it with him and his new wife.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is Lewis so brave? it's as if he thought of me as Henry.
But what did Lady Bona say about my marriage?

Job:
Here are his words, spoken with wild disdain:
"Tell him, hoping that he will soon become a widower,
I will carry the willow garland for him.

KING EDWARD IV:
I don't blame her, she could say a little less;
She was wrong. But what did the queen say about Henry?
Because I heard she was there, on site.

Job:
“Tell him,” she said, “my mourning weeds are over,
And I'm ready to put on some armor.

KING EDWARD IV:
As if she wanted to play the Amazon.
But what did Warwick say about these injuries?

Job:
He, more irritated with Your Majesty
All the rest dismissed me with these words:
"Tell him for me that he has hurt me,
And that's why I'm going to take him off his crown shortly.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ha! did the traitor dare to speak such proud words?
Well, I will arm myself, being thus warned:
They will have wars and pay for their presumption.
But let's say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?

Job:
Yes, gracious sovereign; they are so connected
friendship
This young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.

CLARENCE:
Like the eldest; Clarence will have the youngest.
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit tight,
For now I go to Warwick's other daughter;
Even though I want a kingdom, I'm still married
I cannot be inferior to you.
You who love me and Warwick, follow me.

GLOCKESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Both Clarence and Somerset are off to Warwick!
However, I am armed against the worst that could happen;
And we must hurry in this desperate case.
Pembroke and Stafford, you on our behalf
Go raise men and prepare for war;
They are already, or will soon be disembarked:
I myself will follow you directly.
But before leaving, Hastings and Montague,
Solve my doubt. You two, of all others,
Related to Warwick by blood and marriage:
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
If so, then both go to him;
I wish you enemies rather than hollow friends:
But if you want to keep your true obedience,
Give me assurance with a friendly wish,
So that I can never suspect you.

ASSEMBLY :
So God help Montague to prove himself right!

HASTING:
And Hastings who favors Edward's cause!

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, Brother Richard, will you support us?

GLOCKESTER:
Yes, despite everything that will resist you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Well then! then I am sure of victory.
Now then, let us go; and don't waste any time,
Until we meet Warwick and his foreign power.
3KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Believe me, my lord, so far everything is going well;
Ordinary people, in numbers, rush towards us.
But look where Somerset and Clarence are coming from!
Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?

CLARENCE:
Have no fear, my lord.

WARWICK:
So, kind Clarence, welcome to Warwick;
And welcome, Somerset: I consider it cowardice
Stay wary where a noble heart
Pawned an open hand as a sign of love;
Otherwise, I might think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
Were only a pretended friend of our efforts:
But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter will be yours.
And now what is left but, in the cover of night,
Your brother being carelessly camped,
His soldiers prowled the surrounding towns,
And but accompanied by a simple guardian,
Can we surprise him and take him as we please?
Our scouts found the adventure very simple:
It's like Ulysses and big Diomedes
With sleight and manhood I stole the tents of Rhesus,
And he brought from there the mortal steeds of the Thracians,
So we, well covered in the black mantle of night,
Out of the blue, he can shoot down Edward's guard
And grab hold; I say no, kill him,
Because my intention is only to surprise him.
You who will follow me until this attempt,
Clap Henry's name with your leader.
Well, let's continue our way in silence:
For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!
3KING HENRY VI

First goalkeeper:
Come on, my masters, everyone takes a stand:
The king puts him to sleep like this.

Second goalkeeper:
What, he's not going to bed?

First goalkeeper:
Why no ; because he made a solemn vow
Never lie and take your natural rest
Until Warwick or himself is completely suppressed.

Second goalkeeper:
Tomorrow will probably be the day,
If Warwick is as close as men claim.

Third goalkeeper:
But pray tell, which noble is it?
The one who rests here with the king in his tent?

First goalkeeper:
This is Lord Hastings, the king's greatest friend.

Third goalkeeper:
Oh, is that so? But why does the king command
Let his main supporters lodge in the towns around him,
While he himself remains in the cold field?

Second goalkeeper:
It is all the more honor because it is more dangerous.

Third goalkeeper:
Yes, but give me adoration and tranquility;
I prefer that to a dangerous honor.
If Warwick knew what state he was in,
It's unlikely he'll wake him up.

First goalkeeper:
Unless our halberds block his path.

Second goalkeeper:
Yes, why do we guard his royal tent,
But to defend oneself against the enemies of the night?

WARWICK:
This is his tent; and see where his guard stands.
Courage, my masters! honor now or never!
But follow me, and Edward will be ours.

First goalkeeper:
Who's there?

Second goalkeeper:
Stay, or you die!

SOMERSET:
Who are those who steal there?

WARWICK:
Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is the duke.

KING EDWARD IV:
The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
You call me king.

WARWICK:
Yes, but the case is different:
When you dishonored me in my embassy,
Then I degraded you from the rank of king,
And now come and create your Duke of York.
Alas! how should you rule a kingdom,
Who do not know how to use ambassadors,
Nor how to be satisfied with just one woman,
Nor how to use your brothers fraternally,
Nor how to study for the welfare of the people,
Or how to protect yourself from enemies?

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, brother of Clarence, are you there too?
No, then I see Edward needs to come down.
Yet, Warwick, despite all misfortunes,
Of yourself and all your accomplices,
Edward will always behave like a king:
Even if the malice of fortune reverses my state,
My mind goes beyond the compass of its wheel.

WARWICK:
So, for his spirit, be Edward King of England:
But Henry will now wear the English crown,
And truly be a true king, you who are only the shadow.
My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
See that Duke Edward is transported immediately
To my brother, Archbishop of York.
When I fought with Pembroke and his comrades,
I'll follow you and tell you what the answer is
Lewis and Lady Bona send it to him.
Now, for a moment, farewell, good Duke of York.

KING EDWARD IV:
What destiny imposes, men must necessarily respect;
He boots not to resist the wind and tide.

OXFORD:
What remains for us now, my lords, to do?
But marching towards London with our soldiers?

WARWICK:
Yes, this is the first thing we must do;
To free King Henry from imprisonment
And see him sitting on the royal throne.
3KING HENRY VI

RIVERS:
Madam, what motivates you in this sudden change?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why Brother Rivers, you haven't learned yet
What late misfortune befell King Edward?

RIVERS:
What! the loss of a pitched battle against Warwick?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, but the loss of one's own royal person.

RIVERS:
So is my sovereign killed?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Yes, almost killed, because he is taken prisoner,
Be betrayed by the lie of his guard
Or by his enemy surprised unexpectedly:
And, as I must further understand,
Is newly engaged with the Bishop of York,
Fell the brother of Warwick and thus our enemy.

RIVERS:
These news, I must admit, are full of pain;
Yet, gracious madam, bear it as best you can:
Warwick can lose, because he has now won.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
In the meantime, right hope must prevent the decay of life.
And I prefer to wean myself from despair
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
That's what makes me curb my passion
And gently bear the cross of my misfortune;
Yes, yes, for that, I shed a lot of tears
And stop the rise of blood-sucking sighs,
Lest with my sighs or my tears I explode or drown
Fruit of King Edward, true heir to the English crown.

RIVERS:
But, madam, where has Warwick become?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I am informed that he is coming towards London,
To put the crown back on Henry's head:
Guess the rest; King Edward's friends must fall,
But to prevent the violence of the tyrant,
For do not trust him who once betrayed the faith,
So I go immediately to the sanctuary,
To save at least the heir of Edward's rights:
There I will be safe from force and fraud.
Come then, let us flee while we can fly:
If Warwick takes us, we will certainly die.
3KING HENRY VI

GLOCKESTER:
Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
Stop wondering why I lured you here,
In this largest thicket in the park.
So it is: you know our king, my brother,
Is here a prisoner of the bishop, in whose hands
He has good use and great freedom,
And, often but accompanied by a weak guard,
He comes here to hunt for fun.
I announced it by secret means
That if towards this hour he was heading
Under the color of his usual game,
He will find his friends here with horses and men
To free him from his captivity.

Hunter:
This way, my lord; because that's how the game is played.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, over here, man: see where the hunters are at.
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings and others,
Are you standing so close to steal the bishop's deer?

GLOCKESTER:
Brother, time and business require haste:
Your horse is ready at the corner of the park.

KING EDWARD IV:
But where are we going then?

HASTING:
To Lynn, my lord,
And ship from there to Flanders.

GLOCKESTER:
Well, I guessed it, believe me; because that's what I wanted to say.

KING EDWARD IV:
Stanley, I will reward your audacity.

GLOCKESTER:
But why do we stay? now is not the time to talk.

KING EDWARD IV:
Hunter, what do you say? Do you want to accompany me?

Hunter:
Better to do it than wait and be hanged.

GLOCKESTER:
Come then, go; let's not make any more noise.

KING EDWARD IV:
Bishop, farewell: protect yourself from Warwick's frown;
And pray that I may regain possession of the crown.
3KING HENRY VI

KING HENRY VI:
Master lieutenant, now that God and my friends
I shook Edward from the royal seat,
And I transformed my state of captivity into freedom,
My fear into hope, my sorrows into joy,
When we expand, what are your fees due?

Lieutenant:
Subjects cannot contest anything with their sovereigns;
But if humble prayer can prevail,
I then ask your Majesty for forgiveness.

KING HENRY VI:
For what, lieutenant? to use me well?
No, be sure that I will reward your kindness,
For this, my imprisonment was a pleasure;
Yes, such a pleasure as caged birds
Conceive after many brooding thoughts
Finally with notes of domestic harmony
They completely forget their loss of freedom.
But, Warwick, after God you set me free,
This is why I especially thank God and you;
He was the author, you the instrument.
Therefore, that I may overcome the spite of fortune
Living low, where fortune cannot harm me,
And may the inhabitants of this blessed land
I cannot be punished by my annoying stars,
Warwick, though my head still wears the crown,
I hand over my government to you here,
For you are happy in all your actions.

WARWICK:
Your grace is always known to be virtuous;
And now can appear as wise as virtuous,
By spying and avoiding the malice of fortune,
For few men rightly distrust the stars:
Yet on this point let me rebuke your grace,
For choosing me when Clarence is in place.

CLARENCE:
No, Warwick, you are worthy of the hold,
Whose heavens in your nativity
Awarded an olive branch and a laurel wreath,
Equally likely to be blessed in peace and in war;
And that is why I give you my free consent.

WARWICK:
And I choose Clarence only as a protector.

KING HENRY VI:
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
Let no dissension prevent the government:
I make you two the protectors of this earth,
While I myself lead a private life
And I spend my last days in devotion,
To the rebuke of sin and the praise of my Creator.

WARWICK:
What responds to Clarence for the will of his sovereign?

CLARENCE:
Let him consent, if Warwick yields his consent;
For it is on your fortune that I rest.

WARWICK:
Why then, despite my repugnance, must I be content with:
We will cling together, like a double shadow
To Henry's body, and replace it;
I mean, carrying the weight of government,
While he enjoys honor and his ease.
And, Clarence, now it's more than necessary
Immediately let Edward be declared a traitor,
And all his lands and all his goods will be confiscated.

CLARENCE:
What else? and that the succession be determined.

WARWICK:
Yes, Clarence won't want his role.

KING HENRY VI:
But, to begin with your main business,
Let me beg you, for I no longer command,
May Margaret your queen and my son Edward
Be sent to return from France with all haste;
For until I see them here, out of dubious fear
My joy of freedom is half eclipsed.

CLARENCE:
This will be done, my sovereign, as quickly as possible.

KING HENRY VI:
My lord of Somerset, what a youth this is,
Who do you seem to care for so tenderly?

SOMERSET:
My lord is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.

KING HENRY VI:
Come here, England's hope.
If secret powers
Suggest only truth to my divine thoughts,
This pretty boy will prove the happiness of our country.
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
His head is naturally framed to wear a crown,
His hand to wield a scepter, and himself
Probably in time to bless a royal throne.
Make much of him, my lords, for it is he
I have to help you more than I hurt you.

WARWICK:
What news, my friend?

Job:
That Edward escaped your brother,
And fled, as we have heard since, to Burgundy.

WARWICK:
Unsavory news! but how was he able to escape?

Job:
It was transmitted by Richard Duke of Gloucester
And Lord Hastings, who accompanied him
In secret ambush near the forest
And the bishop's hunters delivered him;
Because hunting was his daily exercise.

WARWICK:
My brother was too neglectful of his charge.
But let us, my sovereign, provide
A balm for any wound that may arise.

SOMERSET:
My lord, I do not like this flight of Edward;
Because without doubt Burgundy will bring him help,
And we will have other wars before long.
As Henry's final prophecy portends
I contented my heart with the hope of this young Richmond,
My heart also worries about these conflicts
What can happen to him, to his detriment and to ours:
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to avoid the worst,
We will send it immediately to Brittany,
Until the storms of civil enmity have passed.

OXFORD:
Yes, because if Edward regains possession of the crown,
It feels like Richmond and the others are going to fall.

SOMERSET:
It will be like this; he will go to Brittany.
Come on, let's go quickly.
3KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, Brother Richard, Lord Hastings and others,
Yet so far fortune has made us amends,
And said once again I'll trade
My state declined for Henry's royal crown.
Well we have crossed and now recrossed the seas
And brought the desired help from Burgundy:
What remains then, having thus happened to us
From the harbor of Ravenspurgh before the gates of York,
But for us to enter, as in our duchy?

GLOCKESTER:
Fast doors! Brother, I don't like it;
For many men who stumble at the threshold
Are well predicted that danger lurks within.

KING EDWARD IV:
Tush, man, homes need no longer frighten us:
By fair or foul means we must enter,
Because this is where our friends will come to visit us.

HASTING:
My lord, I will strike once more to summon them.

Mayor:
Gentlemen, we have been informed of your coming,
And close the doors for our safety;
For now, we owe our allegiance to Henry.

KING EDWARD IV:
But, master mayor, if Henry is your king,
However, Edward is at least Duke of York.

Mayor:
It is true, my good lord; I know you for nothing less.

KING EDWARD IV:
Well, and I dispute nothing but my duchy,
Like being quite happy with that alone.

GLOCKESTER:

HASTING:
Why, master mayor, why do you doubt?
Open the doors; we are the friends of King Henry.

Mayor:
Yes, you say so? the doors will then be opened.

GLOCKESTER:
A wise and robust captain, and soon to be convinced!

HASTING:
The good old man would like everything to go well,
So it wasn't long on his part; but having entered,
I don't doubt it, but we will soon persuade
He and all his brothers come to their senses.

KING EDWARD IV:
So, master mayor: these doors must not be closed
But at night or in times of war.
What! Fear not, man, but give me back the keys;
Because Edward will defend the city and you,
And all these friends who deign to follow me.

GLOCKESTER:
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
Our faithful friend, unless I'm mistaken.

KING EDWARD IV:
Welcome, Sir John! But why do you come armed?

ASSEMBLY :
To help King Edward in this time of storm,
As any faithful subject should.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thank you, good Montgomery; but we forget now
Our title to the crown and our only claim
Our duchy until God pleases to send the rest.

ASSEMBLY :
So, good luck, because I repeat:
I came to serve a king and not a duke.
Drummer, strike and let's go.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, stay, Sir John, a moment, and we will debate
By what safe means can the crown be recovered?

ASSEMBLY :
What are you talking about debating? in a few words,
If you do not proclaim yourself our king here,
I'll leave you to your fortune and I'm leaving
To hold back those who come to your aid:
Why should we fight, if you claim to have no title?

GLOCKESTER:
Why, my brother, why do you insist on beautiful points?

KING EDWARD IV:
When we become stronger, then we will assert our claim:
In the meantime, it is wise to hide our intention.

HASTING:
No more scrupulous spirit! now weapons must reign.

GLOCKESTER:
And intrepid spirits ascend to crowns sooner.
Brother, we will proclaim to you from the outset:
Its sound will bring you many friends.

KING EDWARD IV:
So let it be as you wish; because it is my right,
And Henry usurps the tiara.

ASSEMBLY :
Yes, now my sovereign speaks like him;
And now I will be Edward's champion.

HASTING:
Sound the trumpet; Edward will here be proclaimed:
Come, comrade, make a proclamation.

Soldier:
Edward IV, by the grace of God, king of
England and France, and Lord of Ireland, etc.

ASSEMBLY :
And whoever disputes the right of King Edward,
By this I challenge him to a single combat.

All:
Long live Edward IV!

KING EDWARD IV:
Thank you, brave Montgomery; and thank you all:
If fortune serves me, I will reward this kindness.
Now, for this night, let us approach here to York;
And when the morning sun raises its car
Above the border of this horizon,
We will head towards Warwick and his companions;
Because I know very well that Henry is not a soldier.
Ah, sassy Clarence! how wrong it seems to you
To flatter Henry and abandon your brother!
However, if possible, we will meet you and Warwick.
Come on, brave soldiers: no doubt of the day,
And, once obtained, there is no doubt that the salary will be high.
3KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
What advice, lords? Edward of Belgium,
With hasty Germans and brutal Dutch,
Safely crossed the narrow seas,
And with his troops marches towards London;
And many stunned people flock to him.

KING HENRY VI:
Let's raise men and push him back.

CLARENCE:
A small fire is quickly extinguished;
What the rivers, undergoing suffering, cannot extinguish.

WARWICK:
In Warwickshire I have true friends,
Not mutinous in peace, but bold in war;
I will gather them: and you, son Clarence,
I will stir in Suffolk, Norfolk and Kent,
The knights and gentlemen who will accompany you:
You, Brother Montague, at Buckingham,
Northampton and Leicestershire I will find
Men well inclined to hear what you command:
And you, brave Oxford, wonderful beloved,
In Oxfordshire you will gather your friends.
My sovereign, with loving citizens,
Like his island surrounded by the ocean,
Or the modest Dian surrounded by her nymphs,
We will rest in London until we come to him.
Beautiful lords, take your leave and do not answer.
Farewell, my sovereign.

KING HENRY VI:
Farewell, my Hector, and the true hope of my Troy.

CLARENCE:
As a sign of truth, I kiss the hand of Your Highness.

KING HENRY VI:
Clarence, self-righteous, be happy!

ASSEMBLY :
Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.

OXFORD:
And so I seal my truth and say goodbye.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet Oxford, and my beloved Montague,
And suddenly, once again, a happy farewell.

WARWICK:
Farewell, sweet lords: let us meet again in Coventry.

KING HENRY VI:
Here, at the palace, I will rest for a while.
Cousin of Exeter, what does your lordship think?
I think of the power Edward has on the ground
I shouldn't be able to meet mine.

EXECUTE:
The doubt is that he will be able to seduce others.

KING HENRY VI:
This is not my fear; my meed brought me fame:
I did not cover my ears to their requests,
Nor did they drop off their suits with slow delays;
My pity was a balm to heal their wounds,
My gentleness has soothed their swollen sorrows,
My mercy has dried up their flowing tears;
I did not desire their wealth,
Nor much oppressed them with large subsidies.
Nor eager for revenge, although they were very wrong:
So why should they love Edward more than me?
No, Exeter, these graces defy grace:
And when the lion caresses the lamb,
The lamb will never stop following him.

EXECUTE:
Listen, listen, my lord! what cries are these?

KING EDWARD IV:
Seize the shame-faced Henry, take him hence;
And proclaims us once more king of England.
You are the source that makes the little streams flow:
Now stop your spring; my sea will suck them dry,
And swell all the higher by their reflux.
Therefore with him to the Tower; that he doesn't speak.
And, lords, towards Coventry we bend our course
Where now stands peremptory Warwick:
The sun is shining ; and, if we use the delay,
The cold and bitter winter spoils our hoped-for hay.

GLOCKESTER:
Early, before his forces rejoin,
And take the great traitor by surprise:
Brave warriors, march towards Coventry.
3KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Where did the message come from valiant Oxford?
Where is your lord, my honest man?

First messenger:
By this to Dunsmore, marching forward.

WARWICK:
How far away is our brother Montague?
Where is the message that comes from Montague?

Second messenger:
By this to Daintry, with a mighty troop.

WARWICK:
Say, Somerville, what does my beloved son say?
And how far away do you think Clarence is now?

SOMERSET:
At Southam I left him with his forces,
And expect him here in two hours.

WARWICK:
Then Clarence is close at hand, I hear his drum.

SOMERSET:
It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
The drum your honor hears comes from Warwick.

WARWICK:
Who should it be? for example, unexpected friends.

SOMERSET:
They are at your fingertips, and you will quickly know it.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and make people speak.

GLOCKESTER:
See how the surly Warwick holds the wall!

WARWICK:
O spontaneous wickedness! Did the sporty Edward come?
Where did our scouts sleep, or how are they seduced,
That we had no news of its repair?

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, Warwick, will you open the city gates,
Speak sweet words and humbly bend the knee,
Call Edward King and beg for mercy?
And he will forgive you these outrages.

WARWICK:
Nay, would you rather draw your strength from here,
Confess who established you and who tore you away,
Call Warwick's boss and do penance?
And you will always remain the Duke of York.

GLOCKESTER:
I thought at least he would have said the king;
Or did he make this joke against his will?

WARWICK:
A dukedom, sir, is it not a beautiful gift?

GLOCKESTER:
Yes, by my faith, for a poor count to give:
I will do you a favor for such a good gift.

WARWICK:
It was I who gave the kingdom to your brother.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why is he mine, if only because of Warwick's gift?

WARWICK:
You are not an Atlas for such a great weight:
And weak, Warwick takes back his gift;
And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
But the King of Warwick is Edward's prisoner:
And, brave Warwick, just answer this:
What is the body when the head is cut off?

GLOCKESTER:
Alas, Warwick no longer had any predictions,
But, while he thought he was stealing the single ten,
The king was sneakily fingered from the bridge!
You left poor Henry at the bishopric,
And, ten to one, you will meet him at the Tower.

EDWARD:
This is still the case; yet you are still Warwick.

GLOCKESTER:
Come, Warwick, take your time; kneel down, kneel down:
No, when? strike now, otherwise the iron will cool.

WARWICK:
I would rather cut off this hand with one blow,
And with the other throw it in your face,
Than to carry such a low sail to hit you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sail as best you can, have wind and tide your friend,
This hand, wrapped quickly around your coal black hair
Must, while your head is hot and freshly cut,
Write this sentence in the dust with your blood,
“Warwick, who changes the wind, can no longer change. »

WARWICK:
O cheerful colors! see where Oxford is coming!

OXFORD:
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!

GLOCKESTER:
The doors are open, let's go in too.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thus, other enemies could fall on our backs.
Let us stand in good position; because they without a doubt
He will come out again and offer us battle:
Otherwise, the city being only a small defense,
We will quickly awaken the traitors in the same way.

WARWICK:
Oh, welcome, Oxford! because we want your help.

ASSEMBLY :
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!

GLOCKESTER:
You and your brother will both buy this betrayal
Even with the most precious blood your bodies carry.

KING EDWARD IV:
The harder the match, the greater the victory:
My mind portends happy gain and conquest.

SOMERSET:
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!

GLOCKESTER:
Two of your name, both Dukes of Somerset,
Have sold their lives to the house of York;
And you will be the third if this sword holds.

WARWICK:
And there you have it, where George de Clarence rushes in,
Strong enough to ask his brother to fight;
Among whom an honest zeal for good prevails
More than the nature of a brother's love!
Come, Clarence, come; you will, if Warwick calls.

CLARENCE:
Father of Warwick, do you know what that means?
Look here, I throw my infamy at you
I will not ruin my father's house,
Who gave his blood to cement the stones,
And I installed Lancaster. Well, it's true, Warwick,
That Clarence is so harsh, so direct, unnatural,
To bend the deadly instruments of war
Against his brother and his rightful king?
Perhaps you will object to my holy oath:
Keeping this oath was even more impious
Than that of Jephthah, when he sacrificed his daughter.
I am truly sorry for my intrusion
That, to deserve well from my brother's hands,
I here proclaim myself your mortal enemy,
With resolution, wherever I meet you...
As I will meet you, if you move abroad...
To torment you because of your mistake in misleading me.
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I challenge you,
And towards my brother I turn my blushing cheeks.
Forgive me, Edward, I will make amends:
And, Richard, do not disapprove of my faults,
Because I will no longer be fickle.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now welcome more, and ten times more loved,
As if you had never deserved our hatred.

GLOCKESTER:
Welcome, good Clarence; it’s fraternal.

WARWICK:
O traitorous passenger, perjured and unjust!

KING EDWARD IV:
What, Warwick, are you going to leave town and fight?
Or should we strike the stones around your ears?

WARWICK:
Alas, I am not locked here to defend myself!
I'm going to Barnet straight away,
And offer to fight, Edward, if you dare.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, Warwick, Edward dares and leads the way.
Lords, on the ground; Saint George and victory!
3KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
So lie there: die, and die of our fear;
Because Warwick was an insect that we all feared.
Now, Montague, sit tight; I'm looking for you,
So that Warwick's bones can keep you company.

WARWICK:
Oh, who is there? come to me, friend or foe,
And tell me who is the winner, York or Warwick?
Why am I asking this? my mutilated body shows,
My blood, my lack of strength, my sick heart manifest themselves.
That I must abandon my body to the earth
And, by my fall, conquest to my enemy.
Thus yields the cedar to the edge of the axe,
Whose arms sheltered the princely eagle,
Under whose shadow the lion rampant slept,
Whose upper branch surpassed the spreading tree of Jupiter
And protected the low shrubs from the powerful winter wind.
These eyes, now obscured by the black veil of death,
Were as piercing as the midday sun,
To search for the secret betrayals of the world:
The wrinkles in my eyebrows, now filled with blood,
They were often compared to royal sepulchres;
For who lived as a king without me being able to dig his grave?
And who dared mine when Warwick bowed his brow?
Behold, now my glory is stained with dust and blood!
My parks, my walks, my mansions that I had.
Even now, abandon me and all my lands
I only have the length of my body left.
Why, what is the pomp, the rule, the reign, if not earth and dust?
And we live as best we can, but we must die.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! were you like us.
We could recoup all our losses again;
The Queen of France brought powerful power:
Even now we were hearing the news: Ah, could you fly!

WARWICK:
Well, then I wouldn't steal. Ah, Montague,
If you are there, my sweet brother, take my hand.
And with your lips keep a moment in my soul!
You do not love me ; because, brother, if you did,
Your tears would wash away this cold and frozen blood
It sticks to my lips and won't let me speak.
Come quickly, Montague, or I'm dead.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick! Montague breathed his last;
And to my last breath I cried out for Warwick,
And he said: “Commend me to my valiant brother. »
And he would have said more, and he would have spoken more,
Which sounded like a clamor in a vault,
This should not be distinguished; but finally
I could well hear, delivered with a moan,
“Oh, farewell, Warwick!

WARWICK:
Sweet rest his soul! Flee, lords, and save yourselves;
For Warwick bids you all farewell and will meet you in heaven.

OXFORD:
Go, go, to meet the great power of the queen!
3KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Until now our fortune continues to progress,
And we are adorned with crowns of victory.
But, in the middle of this radiant day,
I see a black cloud, suspicious and threatening,
Who will meet our glorious sun,
Before reaching his comfortable Western bed:
I mean, my lords, these powers that the queen
The people of Gallia have arrived on our shores
And, as we will, march to fight with us.

CLARENCE:
A little gust of wind will soon disperse this cloud
And blow it to the source where it came from:
The very beams will dry these vapors,
Because not every cloud creates a storm.

GLOCKESTER:
The queen is estimated at thirty thousand people,
And Somerset, with Oxford, fled to her:
If she has time to breathe, rest assured
His faction will be as strong as ours.

KING EDWARD IV:
We are heralded by our loving friends
Let them stay on course towards Tewksbury:
We, now having the best on Barnet's field,
I will go straight, because good will clears the way;
And, as we walk, our strength will be increased
In each county as we go.
Throw the drum; shout “Courage!” » and far.
3KING HENRY VI

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
The great lords, the wise never sit down and mourn their loss,
But joyfully seek how to right their wrongs.
And if the mast were now blown overboard,
The cable broke, the holding anchor was lost,
And half of our sailors were swallowed up in the flood?
Yet our pilot still lives. It is not appropriate that he
Should leave the bar and like a fearful boy
Eyes full of tears, add water to the sea
And give more strength to those who have too much,
While, in its complaint, the ship splits on the rock,
What industry and what courage could have saved?
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a mistake it was!
Let’s say Warwick was our anchor; what about that?
And Montague our summit; and him ?
Our friends massacred the tackles; what about these?
Why isn't Oxford another anchor point here?
And Somerset, another beautiful mast?
Friends of France, our shrouds and plating?
And, even if it's not clever, why not Ned and I
For once, is the charge of the skilled pilot authorized?
We will not sit and cry from the rudder,
But keep our course, even if the strong wind says no,
Shelves and rocks that threaten us with shipwreck.
As good to rebuke the waves as to speak them fairly.
And what is Edward but a merciless sea?
What Clarence but quicksand of deception?
And Richard, but a fatal and tattered rock?
All these enemies of our poor crust.
Say you know how to swim; alas, it's only for a moment!
Walk on the sand; why, there you sink quickly:
Straddle the rock; the tide will carry you away,
Or you are hungry; it’s a triple death.
This is what I say, lords, to make you understand,
If one of you ran away from us,
That there's no mercy expected with brothers
More than with merciless waves, with sand and rocks.
Well, courage then! which cannot be avoided
“It was childish weakness to complain or fear.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I think that a woman of this valiant spirit
If a coward heard him say these words,
Infuse his chest with magnanimity
And make him, naked, outwit a man-at-arms.
I'm not talking about this to doubt it here
For did I suspect a fearful man
He should be allowed to leave from time to time,
Lest in our need he may infect another
And restore to him a spirit like himself.
If there are any here, God forbid!
Let him go before we need his help.

OXFORD:
Women and children of such great courage,
And the warriors faint! well, it was a perpetual shame.
O brave young prince! your famous grandfather
Living again in you: may you live long
To carry his image and renew his glories!

SOMERSET:
And he will not fight for such hope.
Go home, lie down, and like the owl in the daytime,
If he stands up, people will laugh and wonder at him.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Thank you, kind Somerset; sweet Oxford, thank you.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And accept his thanks which have nothing else.

Messenger:
Prepare yourselves, lords, for Edward is near.
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.

OXFORD:
I didn't think any less: it's his policy
Rushing so quickly, only to find ourselves without provisions.

SOMERSET:
But he is deceived; we are ready.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
It gladdens my heart to see your audacity.

OXFORD:
Here begin our battle; that is why we will not move.

KING EDWARD IV:
Courageous disciples, there stands the thorny wood,
Who, with the help of heaven and your strength,
The roots must be cut before nightfall.
I don't need to add more fuel to your fire,
Because I know that you are flaming to burn them
Give the signal to battle, and to him, lords!

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Lords, knights and gentlemen, what shall I say
My tears contradict; for every word I speak,
You see, I drink the water out of my eyes.
So, nothing more than this: Henry, your sovereign,
Is a prisoner of the enemy; its usurped state,
His kingdom is a slaughterhouse, his subjects killed,
His statutes canceled and his treasure spent;
And over there, it's the wolf who makes all this mess.
You fight in justice: then, in the name of God, lords,
Be brave and give the signal to fight.
3KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now comes a period of tumultuous turbulence.
Go from Oxford to Hames Castle directly:
For Somerset, get rid of his guilty head.
Come on, carry them from here; I won't hear them speak.

OXFORD:
For my part, I will not bother you with words.

SOMERSET:
Me neither, but I look patiently at my fortune.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
So we part sadly in this troubled world,
To find ourselves with joy in sweet Jerusalem.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is the proclamation made, he who finds Edward
Will he have a high reward, and he his life?

GLOCKESTER:
It is: and there comes young Edward!

KING EDWARD IV:
Bring out the valiant, let's hear him speak.
What! can a thorn so young start to sting?
Edward, what satisfaction can you give
For having borne arms, for having stirred up my subjects,
And all the trouble you got me into?

PRINCE EDWARD:
Speak like a subject, proud and ambitious York!
Suppose I am now my father's mouth;
Give up your chair, and where I stand, kneel,
While I offer you the same words,
Which traitor would you like me to answer.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Ah, that your father was so resolute!

GLOCKESTER:
That perhaps you had still worn the petticoat,
And I never stole the Lancaster cylinder head.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Let Aesop's fable in a winter's night;
His currish riddles don't fit this place.

GLOCKESTER:
By heaven, kid, I'm going to torment you for that word.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Yes, you were born to be a scourge to men.

GLOCKESTER:
For God's sake, take away this captive rebuke.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No, instead keep this snarling crook away.

KING EDWARD IV:
Peace, willing boy, or I will charm your tongue.

CLARENCE:
Uneducated boy, you are too clumsy.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I know my duty; you are all unworthy:
Edward lascivious, and you perjured George,
And you, deformed Dick, I tell you all
I am your best, traitors like you:
And you are usurping my father's rights and mine.

KING EDWARD IV:
Take that, kind of resemblance to this taunt here.

GLOCKESTER:
Are you spreading out? take this, to end your agony.

CLARENCE:
And that's it for tormenting me with perjury.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Oh, kill me too!

GLOCKESTER:
Get married, and you will.

KING EDWARD IV:
Wait, Richard, wait; because we have done too much.

GLOCKESTER:
Why should she live to fill the world with words?

KING EDWARD IV:
What, is she fainting? use means for his recovery.

GLOCKESTER:
Clarence, excuse me to the king, my brother;
So I'm going to London for serious business:
Before you come there, make sure you hear some news.

CLARENCE:
What? What ?

GLOCKESTER:
The Tower, the Tower.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
O Ned, sweet Ned! talk to your mother, my boy!
Can't you speak? O traitors! murderers!
Those who stabbed Caesar shed no blood,
Did not offend and was not worthy of blame,
If this vile act were to equal it:
He was a man; this, with regard to a child:
And men never devote their fury to a child.
What's worse than a murderer, so to speak?
No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
And I will speak so that my heart will burst.
Butchers and villains! damn cannibals!
What a beautiful plant you cut prematurely!
You have no children, butchers! if you had,
Their thought would have aroused remorse:
But if you're ever lucky enough to have a child,
Look at his youth for having him so cut
How, men of death, you have rid of this sweet young prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
Far from her; Come on, take her away by force.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
No, never take me from here, send me here,
Here, sheathe your sword, I will forgive you my death:
What, you don't want to? So, Clarence, do it.

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I won't make it so easy for you.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Good Clarence, do it; sweet Clarence, do it.

CLARENCE:
Didn't you hear me swear I wouldn't do it?

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
Yes, but you usually abstain:
It used to be sin, but now it’s charity.
What, you don't want to? Where is this devil's butcher,
Richard, the disadvantaged? Richard, where are you?
You are not here: murder is your alms;
You never turn away blood seekers.

KING EDWARD IV:
Far away, I said; I'm in charge, take her from here.

QUEEN MARGUERITE:
So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
Where did Richard go?

CLARENCE:
In London, all stationed; and, as I suppose,
Have a bloody supper in the Tower.

KING EDWARD IV:
It's sudden, as soon as something comes to mind.
Now let's go: let's unload the common people
With pay and thanks, and off to London
And see our sweet queen how well she is doing:
By this, I hope, she will have a son for me.
3KING HENRY VI

GLOCKESTER:
Hello, my lord. What, your book is so hard?

KING HENRY VI:
Yes, my good lord: my lord, I should rather say;
It is a sin to flatter; “good” wasn’t much better:
“Good Gloucester” and “good devil” were alike,
And both absurd; therefore not “good God”.

GLOCKESTER:
Sirrah, leave us alone: we must confer.

KING HENRY VI:
Thus flees the reckless shepherd before the wolf;
So first the harmless sheep sheds its fleece
And then down his throat to the butcher knife.
What death scene should Roscius now perform?

GLOCKESTER:
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
The thief fears every bush of an officer.

KING HENRY VI:
The bird that was limed into a bush,
With trembling wings he doubts every bush;
And I, the unfortunate male of a sweet bird,
I now have the fatal object in my eyes
Where my poor child was kicked, caught and killed.

GLOCKESTER:
Well, what a sullen fool Crete was,
This taught his son the poultry trade!
And yet, despite all his wings, the fool drowned.

KING HENRY VI:
I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
Your father, Minos, who denied our way;
The sun that burned my sweet boy's wings
Your brother Edward, and you the sea
Whose envious abyss has swallowed up his life.
Ah, kill me with your gun, not with words!
My chest can better support the point of your dagger
That my ears can hear this tragic story.
But why are you coming? is it not for my life?

GLOCKESTER:
Do you think I'm an executioner?

KING HENRY VI:
You are a persecutor, I am sure:
If killing innocent people is execution,
Well, then you are an executioner.

GLOCKESTER:
I killed your son because of his presumption.

KING HENRY VI:
Would you have been killed when you first presumed,
You didn't live to kill one of my sons.
And so I prophesy that many thousands,
Who is no longer suspicious of my fear,
And the sighing of many old men and many widows,
And many stagnant orphan eyes...
Men for their sons, women for their husbands,
And the orphans of the timeless death of their parents...
I will miss the time you were born.
The owl cried at your birth, a bad sign;
The nocturnal crow cried out, remaining unhappy for a moment;
The dogs howled and a hideous storm shook the trees;
The crow threw it to the top of the chimney,
And chattering pies in lugubrious discords sung.
Your mother felt more than a mother's pain,
And yet he produced less than a mother's hope,
Namely an indigested and deformed mass,
It's not like the fruit of such a beautiful tree.
You had teeth in your head when you were born,
To signify that you have come to bite the world:
And if the rest of what I've heard is true,
You came...

GLOCKESTER:
I will no longer hear: die, prophet in your speech:
This, among other things, is why I was ordained.

KING HENRY VI:
Yes, and many more massacres after that.
God forgives my sins and forgives you!

GLOCKESTER:
What, the sucking blood of Lancaster
Sinking into the ground? I thought it would be up.
See how my sword mourns the death of the poor king!
O, may such purple tears ever be shed
Of those who wish for the fall of our house!
If there is still a spark of life left,
Below, in hell; and say that I sent you there:
I who have neither pity, nor love, nor fear.
Indeed, it’s true what Henry told me about;
Because I often heard my mother say
I came into the world with my legs first:
If I wasn't right, you think, to hurry up,
And seek their ruin which has usurped our right?
The midwife wondered and the women cried
“Oh, Jesus, bless us, he was born with teeth!”
And that's what I was; which clearly meant
That I should growl and bite and play dog.
Then, since the heavens have thus fashioned my body,
Hell make me feel like I answered it.
I don't have a brother, I don't look like any brother;
And this word “love”, which gray beards call divine,
Being a resident among men like others
And not in me: I am myself alone.
Clarence, be careful; you keep me from the light:
But I will sort out a difficult day for you;
For I will broadcast abroad such prophecies
That Edward will fear for his life,
And then, to purge his fear, I will be your death.
King Henry and the prince his son have left:
Clarence, your turn is next, and then the rest,
Count me but bad until I'm better.
I'll throw your body in another room
And triumph, Henry, on your day of misfortune.
3KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Once more we sit on the royal throne of England,
Redeemed with the blood of enemies.
What valiant enemies, like the autumn wheat,
Did we break down, to the height of their pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, Thrice Renowned
For robust and indisputable champions;
Two Cliffords, like father and son,
And two Northumberlands; two braver men
They never spurred their steeds to the sound of the trumpet;
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
who, in their chains, chained the royal lion
And made the forest tremble when they roared.
So we swept suspicion from our seat
And makes our safety step.
Come here, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
Young Ned, for you, your uncles and me
We watched the winter night in our armor,
I walked in the scorching summer heat,
So that you can regain possession of the crown in peace;
And from our labors you will reap the gain.

GLOCKESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.

CLARENCE:
The duty I owe to Your Majesty
I seal the lips of this sweet baby.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thank you, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thank you.

GLOCKESTER:
And that I love the tree from which you were born,
Witness the loving kiss I give to the fruit.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now I sit as my soul rejoices,
Have the peace of my country and the love of my brothers.

CLARENCE:
What will Your Grace have done with Margaret?
Reignier, his father, to the king of France
Pawned the Sicilies and Jerusalem,
And this is where they sent him for his ransom.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go with her and take her from here to France.
And now what's left but to pass the time
With majestic triumphs, joyful comic spectacles,
As befits the pleasure of the court?
Sound the drums and trumpets! Bored sour goodbye!
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If you have the chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia,
the same occasion where my services are now underway
foot, you will see, as I said, large
difference between our Bohemia and your Sicily.

CAMILLO:
I think that this next summer, the king of Sicily
it is paying Bohemia the visit it rightly owes.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Where our entertainment shames us, we will be
justified in our loves; for indeed...

CAMILLO:
I beg you,--

ARCHIDAMUS:
Truly, I say it in the freedom of my knowledge:
we cannot with such magnificence - in such rare circumstances - I know
not what to say. We will give you drinks to sleep,
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficiency,
can, although they cannot praise us, just as little accuse
We.

CAMILLO:
You are paying way too much for what is given for free.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Believe me, I speak as my understanding tells me
and as my honesty says.

CAMILLO:
Sicily cannot be too kind to Bohemia.
They were trained together in their childhood; And
there was then rooted between them such affection,
which can only divide now. Since their
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation from their society, from their meetings,
although not personal, they were royally commissioned
with exchange of gifts, letters, love
embassies; that they seemed to be together,
although absent, shook hands, as on a vast and
embraced, as it were, from opposite ends
the winds. The heavens continue their loves!

ARCHIDAMUS:
I think that in the world there is neither malice nor
important to modify it. You have an unspeakable
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
in my note.

CAMILLO:
I completely agree with you in hoping for him: he
is a valiant child; the one who actually physicalizes the
subject, makes old hearts fresh: those who continued
crutches before birth still desire their life
see him as a man.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they otherwise be content to die?

CAMILLO:
Yes; if there was no other excuse, why should they do it
want to live.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If the king had no sons, they would want to live
on crutches until he got one.

POLIXENES:
Nine changes of the watery star have been
The shepherd's word since we left our throne
Without burden: time becomes so long again
It would be found, my brother, with our thanks;
And yet we should, in perpetuity,
So leave in debt: and therefore, like a number,
Yet, standing in a rich place, I multiply
With a “We thank you” several thousand times
This precedes.

LEONTES:
Wait a moment for your thanks;
And pay them when you separate.

POLIXENES:
Sir, it's tomorrow.
I'm questioned by my fears, about what can happen
Or reproduce in our absence; it can explode
No dull winds among us, to make us say
“This is too true:” moreover, I remained
To tire your royalty.

LEONTES:
We are tougher, brother,
So you can make us do it.

POLIXENES:
Don't stay any more.

LEONTES:
Seven more nights.

POLIXENES:
Very good, tomorrow.

LEONTES:
We will then share the time between the two; and in this
I'm not going to contradict him.

POLIXENES:
Don't rush me, I beg you, then.
There is no tongue that moves, none, none in the world,
As soon as yours could win me: it should do it now,
Was it necessary in your request, even if
“It was necessary, I denied it. My stuff
Even drags me home: which bothers me
Were in your love a whip for me; my stay
To you a burden and a trouble: to save both,
Farewell, our brother.

LEONTES:
Tied tongue, our queen?
talk to you.

HERMIONE:
I had thought, sir, that I had kept silent until
You made him swear not to stay. You, sir,
Charge it too cold. Tell him, are you sure
All is well in Bohemia; this satisfaction
The day passed proclaimed: tell him this,
He is beaten by his best ward.

LEONTES:
Well said, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
Saying that he wants to see his son, were strong:
But then let him say it and go away;
But let him swear it, and he will not stay,
So we're going to hit him with distaffs.
Yet from your royal presence I will venture
A week's loan. When in Bohemia
You take my lord, I will give him my commission
To leave it there a month late
Prefix for parting: however, good deed, Leontes,
I don't love you behind the clock
What a lady, this is her lord. Are you going to stay?

POLIXENES:
No Madam.

HERMIONE:
No, but will you do it?

POLIXENES:
Maybe not, really.

HERMIONE:
In truth!
You put me off with flexible wishes; but I,
Even if you try to desphere the
stars with oaths,
However, we should say “Sir, I am not going there”. In truth,
You will not go: a lady's "In truth"
As powerful as that of a lord. Are you going to go anyway?
Force me to keep you prisoner,
Not as a guest; so you will pay your costs
When you leave, save your thanks. How do you say ?
My prisoner? or my guest? by your fear "Verily",
You will be one of them.

POLIXENES:
Your guest then, madam:
Being your prisoner should involve an offense;
Which is less easy for me to commit to
Than you to punish.

HERMIONE:
Not your jailer, then,
But your kind hostess. Come, I'm going to question you
My lord's tricks and yours when you were children:
Were you pretty lords then?

POLIXENES:
We were, beautiful queen,
Two guys who thought there was nothing left behind
But on a day like today,
And be a forever boy.

HERMIONE:
He was not my lord
The crazier between the two?

POLIXENES:
We were like twin lambs beating in the sun,
And bleat at each other: what we have changed
It was innocence for innocence’s sake; we did not know
The doctrine of evil, neither dreamed of
That's what everyone did. If we had continued this life,
And our weak minds have never been higher
With stronger blood we should have answered the sky
Boldly “not guilty”; the imposition has been erased
Hereditary ours.

HERMIONE:
By this we bring together
Since then, you've been stumbling.

POLIXENES:
O my most sacred lady!
Since then, temptations have arisen among us; For
In those unfinished days, my wife was a girl;
Your precious self didn't meet eyes then
From my young playmate.

HERMIONE:
Grace to start!
Do not draw any conclusions from this, lest you say
Your queen and I are demons: continue however;
We will answer for the offenses we made you commit,
If you sinned for the first time with us and that with us
You continued the mistake and you didn't slip
With anyone but us.

LEONTES:
Has it already been won?

HERMIONE:
He will remain my lord.

LEONTES:
At my request, he will not do so.
Hermione, my darling, you never spoke
For a better purpose.

HERMIONE:
Never?

LEONTES:
Never, but once.

HERMIONE:
What! Did I say it twice? when was that before?
Please tell me; full of praise and do
As big as tame things: a good deed dying without a tongue
Thousands of massacres await this.
Our praise is our salary: you can ride
With a sweet kiss a thousand stadiums before
With a spur we beat an acre. But the goal:
My last good deed was to beg him to stay:
What was my first? he has an older sister,
Or am I wrong: oh, could her name be Grace!
But once before I talked about the goal: when?
No, let me do it; I look forward.

LEONTES:
Well, that was when
Three grumpy months had turned bitter to death,
Before I can make you open your white hand
And applaud, my love: then did you say
'I am yours forever.'

HERMIONE:
It’s truly a grace.
Well, there you go, I talked about it twice:
The one who always won a royal husband;
The other for some while a friend.

LEONTES:

MAMILLIUS:
Yes, my good lord.

LEONTES:
I'm fucking!
Well, he's my talker. What, did you
did you block your nose?
They say it's a copy of mine. Come, captain,
We must be cared for; not neat, but neatly, captain:
And yet the ox, the heifer and the calf
Are all considered neat. - Always virginal
On his palm!… Well, you wanton calf!
Are you my calf?

MAMILLIUS:
Yes, if you wish, my lord.

LEONTES:
You want a difficult passage and the shoots that I have,
To be full like me: yet they say we are
Almost as similar as eggs; women say it,
This will say anything but were they fake
Like overdyed blacks, like the wind, like the waters, false
As the dice must be desired by the one who repairs
There's nothing born between his and mine, but was it true
To think that this boy was like me. Come, Mr. Page,
Look at me with your kind eye: sweet villain!
Very expensive ! my collapse! Can your mother? - maybe not ?
Affection! your intention stabs the center:
You make things possible that are not thus held,
Communicate with dreams; How is it possible ? -
With what is unreal you are coactive,
And it's nothing: so it's very credible
You can participate in something; and you do it,
And this beyond commissions, and I find it,
And this is because of the infection in my brain
And the hardening of my eyebrows.

POLIXENES:
What does Sicily mean?

HERMIONE:
It seems that something is not fixed.

POLIXENES:
How, my lord!
What joy ? How are you, my best brother?

HERMIONE:
You seem to have a very distracted front
Are you moved, my lord?

LEONTES:
No seriously.
As nature sometimes betrays its madness,
His tenderness, and making a hobby
With harder breasts! Looking at the lines
From my boy's face I thought I'd gone backwards
Twenty-three years old, and I saw myself without panties,
In my green velvet coat, my muzzled dagger,
Lest he bite his master and thus prove,
As ornaments often do, too dangerous:
As I thought I was then for this core,
This squash, this gentleman. My honest friend,
Are you going to take eggs for money?

MAMILLIUS:
No, my lord, I will fight.

LEONTES:
You will be! Well, happy man, be unemployed! Besides,
Do you love your young prince as much as we do?
Does he seem to be one of us?

POLIXENES:
If you are at home, sir,
He is all my exercise, my cheerfulness, my business,
Now my sworn friend, then my enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, my statesman, all:
He shortens the day of July like that of December,
And with its different childhood remedies in me
Thoughts that would thicken my blood.

LEONTES:
So lies this squire
Officiate with me: we will both walk, my lord,
And let yourself go to your most serious steps. Hermione,
As you love us, show it in welcoming our brother;
Let what is expensive in Sicily be cheap:
Next to you and my young rover, he is
Apparent to my heart.

HERMIONE:
If you were looking for us,
We are yours in the garden: will we wait for you there?

LEONTES:
Dispose yourself to your own inclinations: you will be found,
Be yourself under the sky.
I fish now,
Although you do not perceive me as I give the line.
Come on !
As she supports the neb, he takes the bill!
And the weapon of a wife's audacity
To her husband who allows it!
Already gone !
An inch thick, up to the knees, over the head and
Forked ears!
Go, play, my boy, play: your mother plays, and I
Play too, but such a dishonored role, the outcome of which
Will he hiss at me to my grave: contempt and clamor
This will be my death knell. Go ahead, play, boy, play.
There have been,
Or I was very wrong, cuckolded before now;
And many men, even now,
Now, while I speak thus, he holds his wife by the arm,
This little girl thinks she was locked out in his absence
And his pond fished by his next neighbor, by
Sir Smile, his neighbor: no, there is comfort in that
While other men have doors and those doors are open,
Like mine, against their will. Must everything despair
Who have rebellious women, the tenth of humanity
They would hang themselves. Physics, because there is none;
It's a planet of debauchery, which will strike
Where it is predominant; and it's powerful, think about it,
From the east, from the west, from the north and from the south: let it be concluded,
No barricado for a stomach; I don't know ;
He will let the enemy in and out
With bag and luggage: several thousand people
I have the disease, and I don't think that's the case. And now, my boy!

MAMILLIUS:
I'm like you, they say.

LEONTES:
Why it's a little comfort. What, Camillo there?

CAMILLO:
Yes, my good lord.

LEONTES:
Go play, Mamillius; you are an honest man.
Camillo, this great man will stay even longer.

CAMILLO:
You had a lot of trouble getting his anchor to hold:
When you chased him away, he still came home.

LEONTES:
Did you notice it?

CAMILLO:
It would not remain for your petitions: fact
His affairs are more material.

LEONTES:
Did you perceive it?
They're already here with me, whispering, rounding
“Sicily is another:” it’s far away,
When I blow it for the last time. How come, Camillo,
That he stayed?

CAMILLO:
At the request of the good queen.

LEONTES:
To the queen's bed: "good" should be relevant
But this is not the case. Was this taken
By someone other than your own?
For your vanity is tempered, it will attract
More than the common blocks: not rated, right,
But of the noblest natures? by a few several
Extraordinary helmet? less damage
Perhaps you are blind to this matter? say.

CAMILLO:
Business, my lord! I think most understand
Bohemia stays here longer.

LEONTES:
Ha!

CAMILLO:
Stay here longer.

LEONTES:
Yes but why ?

CAMILLO:
To satisfy Your Highness and supplications
From our very kind mistress.

LEONTES:
Satisfy!
The pleas of your mistress! satisfy!
Let that be enough. I trusted you, Camillo,
With all the things that matter most to me too
My bedroom councils, where, like a priest, you
I cleaned my breast, I left you
Your penitent has reformed: but we have been
Deceived in your integrity, deceived
In what appears to be the case.

CAMILLO:
Let this be forbidden, my lord!

LEONTES:
To hold on to it, you're not honest, or,
If you are inclined to this, you are a coward,
Which betrays the honesty behind, holding back
Of the required course; otherwise you must be counted
A servant grafted into my earnest trust
And in this careless; or an imbecile
Who sees a game played at home, the rich stake drawn,
And takes it all as a joke.

CAMILLO:
My gracious lord,
I can be careless, foolish and fearful;
In each of these areas, no man is free,
But his negligence, his madness, his fear,
Among the infinite actions of the world,
Sometimes highlights. In your affairs, my lord,
If I were ever willfully negligent,
It was my madness; so diligently
I acted crazy, it was my negligence,
Not weighing the end well; if ever I'm afraid
To do something where I doubted the problem,
Where execution screamed
Against non-performance, it was a fear
Which often infects the wisest: those, my lord,
Are infirmities so permissible that honesty
Is never free from. But, implore your grace,
Be clearer with me; let me know my intrusion
By his own face: if I then deny it,
It's none of mine.

LEONTES:
You haven't seen, Camillo,--
But there's no doubt, you did it, or your glasses
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For a vision so apparent rumor
Cannot be mute, or thought, for cogitation
Do not reside in this man who does not think,
My wife is slippery? If you want to confess,
Or be impudently negative,
To have neither eyes, nor ears, nor thoughts, so say
My wife is a workhorse, deserves a name
As rank as any linen girl who wears
Faced with his promise: say it and justify it.

CAMILLO:
I won't be there to hear
My sovereign mistress grows dark thus, without
My current revenge taken: “muse my heart,
You never talked about what became less of you
Only that ; which to reiterate was a sin
As deep as that, though true.

LEONTES:
Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Kissing with the inner lip? stop career
To laugh with a sigh? – an infallible note
To break honesty, to ride a horse toe to toe?
Hiding in corners? Want faster clocks?
Hours, minutes? midday midnight? and all eyes
Blind with the pin and the web but to them, to them only,
Would that be mean? is it nothing?
Well, then the world and everything in it is nothing;
The sky that covers us is nothing; Bohemia, nothing;
My wife is nothing; nor anything has these nothings,
If it's nothing.

CAMILLO:
Good my lord, be healed
Of this sick opinion, and early;
Because it is the most dangerous.

LEONTES:
Say it, it's true.

CAMILLO:
No, no, my lord.

LEONTES:
It is; you lie, you lie:
I say you lie, Camillo, and I hate you,
Declare yourself a big thug, a stupid slave,
Or a hovering timer, that
Can your eyes see both good and evil,
Tilting towards both: was my wife's liver
Infected like her life, she would not live
How a glass works.

CAMILLO:
Who infects it?

LEONTES:
Well, he who wears it like a medal, hanged
On his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
I had true servants about me, those naked eyes
To see my honor as their profits,
Their own savings, they would do that
Which should undo more things: yes, and you,
His cupbearer, of which I am in a more wicked form
I sat down and lifted myself up to worship, who can see
As the sky sees the earth and the earth sees the sky,
How irritated I am, I could annoy a cup,
To give a lasting wink to my enemy;
Which draft was cordial to me.

CAMILLO:
Sir, my lord,
I could do this and that without a rash potion,
But with persistent drama, it shouldn't work
Maliciously like poison: but I can't
Believe that this crack is in my formidable mistress,
So supremely honorable.
I loved you,--

LEONTES:
Make that your question, and go rot!
I think I'm so muddy, so unstable,
To name me in this vexation, Sully
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
What must be preserved is sleep, which is identified
They are stingers, thorns, nettles, wasp tails,
Make scandalous the blood of the prince my son,
Who I think is mine and I love him as my own,
Without maturing to go there? Would I do this?
Could the man turn so pale?

CAMILLO:
I must believe you, sir:
I do; and he will come and seek Bohemia for that;
Provided that, when he is returned, Your Highness
Take back your queen as yours first,
Even for the sake of your son; and thus to seal
The wound of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours.

LEONTES:
You advise me
Even so, as I myself established:
I will not fault his honor, none.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Go ahead; and with such a clear face
As friendship wears out at parties, stay with Bohemia
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
If he receives a healthy drink from me,
Do not count me as your servant.

LEONTES:
That's all:
Do it and you have half my heart;
Don't do it, you're sharing yours.

CAMILLO:
I will not, my lord.

LEONTES:
I will appear friendly, as you advised me.

CAMILLO:
O miserable lady! But for me,
What situation do I find myself in? I must be the poisoner
Good Polixenes; and my reason for not doing it
Is obedience to a master a
Who in rebellion against himself will have
All this belongs to him too. To accomplish this act,
Promotion follows. If I could find an example
Thousands who had smitten the anointed kings
And having prospered, I would not; but since
Neither brass, nor stone, nor parchment bears one,
Let not even wickedness renounce it. I have to
Abandoning court: to do or not to do so, that's for sure
For me, a daredevil. Lucky star, reign now!
This is Bohemia.

POLIXENES:
It's strange: I think
My favor here is starting to shift. Do not speak?
Hello, Camillo.

CAMILLO:
Hello, very royal sir!

POLIXENES:
What's the news at court?

CAMILLO:
Nothing rare, my lord.

POLIXENES:
The king has such a face on him
As he had lost a province and a region
Loved as he loves himself: even now I have met him
With the usual compliment; when he,
Waving his eyes away and falling
A lip full of contempt moves away from me and
So this leaves me thinking about what reproduction is
This changes his ways.

CAMILLO:
I dare not know, my lord.

POLIXENES:
How! don't dare! not. Do you know it and do you not dare?
Be smart with me: that's pretty much it;
For to yourself, what you know, you owe.
And I can't say, don't you dare. Good Camillo,
Your changed complexion is a mirror for me
Which shows me that mine has changed too; because I have to be
One party in this modification, finding
Myself so modified with this.

CAMILLO:
There is a disease
Which confuses some of us, but
I cannot name the illness; and it's caught
Of you who are doing well.

POLIXENES:
How! caught from me!
Don't make me look like the basil:
I observed thousands of them, which accelerated better
In my opinion, but I didn't kill anyone that way. Camille,...
As you are certainly a gentleman,
Experienced clerk, who no less adorns
Our nobility than the noble names of our parents,
In whose success we are sweet, I beseech you,
If you know anything that is within my knowledge
We must be informed, not imprisoned
In ignorant dissimulation.

CAMILLO:
I can not answer.

POLIXENES:
An illness has caught me, and yet I am doing well!
I need an answer. Do you hear, Camillo,
I conjure you, through every part of man
What honor recognizes, the least of which
Is it not my trial that you declare
What incidence do you guess of evil
Heads towards me; how far, how far;
How to be prevented, if at all;
Otherwise, how best to bear it.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I will tell you;
Since I am charged in honor and by him
This seems honorable to me: therefore heed my advice,
What must be followed as quickly as
I want to say it, or you and me
Cry lost, and then good night!

POLIXENES:
Come on, good Camillo.

CAMILLO:
I appointed him to assassinate you.

POLIXENES:
By whom, Camillo?

CAMILLO:
By the king.

POLIXENES:
For what?

CAMILLO:
He thinks, and even swears with complete confidence,
Like he didn't see it or wasn't an instrument
To stop you from doing it, that you touched his queen
Forbidden.

POLIXENES:
O, then my best blood turns
To an infected jelly and my name
Be under the yoke of the one who betrayed the best!
Then turn my freshest reputation towards
A flavor that can hit the dullest nostrils
Where I arrive, and my approach be avoided,
No, hated too, worse than the biggest infection
It has been heard or read!

CAMILLO:
Swears his thought is over
By each particular star in the sky and
Through all their influences, as much
Ban the sea to obey the moon
As or by oath, withdraw or advise shake
The fabric of his madness, whose foundation
Is stacked on his faith and will continue
The position of his body.

POLIXENES:
How should this grow?

CAMILLO:
I don't know: but I'm sure it's safer to
Avoid what grew up rather than wondering how it came to be.
So if you dare to trust my honesty,
Who is locked in this chest that you
I'll continue, unawn'd, away tonight!
Your subscribers, I will whisper to the company,
And will do it in twos or threes with several posterns
Eliminate them from the city. For my part, I will put
My fortunes at your service, which are here
By this lost discovery. Don't be uncertain;
Because, by the honor of my parents, I
I have spoken the truth: and if you seek to prove it,
I do not dare to sit idly by; and you won't be any safer
Let him who was condemned by the king's own mouth, thereupon
His sworn execution.

POLIXENES:
I believe you :
I saw his heart in the face. Give me your hand :
Be my pilot and your seats will be
Always my neighbor. My ships are ready and
My people expected me to leave
Two days ago. This jealousy
Is for a precious creature: as it is rare,
Should he be great, and as his person is powerful,
It must be violent, and as he sees it
He is dishonored by any man
He was told, well, his vengeance must
It will be made more bitter. Fear darkens me:
Good expedition be my friend and comfort
The gracious queen, part of her theme, but nothing
Of his unhealthy suspicions! Come, Camillo;
I will respect you as a father if
So you give me life: let's avoid it.

CAMILLO:
It is within my authority to command
The keys to all posterns: please Your Highness
Take urgent time. Come, sir, go.

HERMIONE:
Take the boy home: he bothers me so much,
It's unbearable.

First lady:
Come, my gracious lord,
Should I be your playmate?

MAMILLIUS:
No, I won't do that to any of you.

First lady:
Why, my sweet lord?

MAMILLIUS:
You will kiss me hard and you will talk to me as if
I was still a baby. I like you better.

Second lady:
And why, my lord?

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because
Your eyebrows are blacker; but black eyebrows, they say,
Become the best woman, so that there is no
Too much hair there, but in a semi-circle
Or even a half-moon made with a pen.

Second lady:
Who taught you that?

MAMILLIUS:
I learned it from the women's faces. Pray now
What color are your eyebrows?

First lady:
Blue, my lord.

MAMILLIUS:
No, it's a mockery: I saw a lady's nose
It was blue, but not his eyebrows.

First lady:
Listen ;
The queen, your mother, keeps pace: we are going
Introduce our services to a new prince
One of these days; and then you will go wild with us,
If only we had you.

Second lady:
It has spread recently
In large volume: good time meeting him!

HERMIONE:
What wisdom awakens among you? Come, sir, now
I am still for you: please sit next to us,
And tell a story.

MAMILLIUS:
Happy or sad, won't it be?

HERMIONE:
As happy as you want.

MAMILLIUS:
The best sad tale for winter: I have one
Sprites and goblins.

HERMIONE:
Let's go, good sir.
Come on, sit down: go on, and do your best
To scare me with your sprites; you are powerful in this area.

MAMILLIUS:
There was a man--

HERMIONE:
No, come, sit down; then continue.

MAMILLIUS:
Lived near a cemetery: I will say it gently;
There, the crickets won't hear it.

HERMIONE:
Come then,
And give me to my ear.

LEONTES:
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?

First Lord:
Behind the clump of pines I met them; Never
I saw the men walking along it: I watched them
Even to their ships.

LEONTES:
How blessed I am
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alas, for less knowledge! how cursed it is
To be so happy! There might be some in the cup
A spider soaked, and we can drink, go away,
And yet he consumes no venom, as far as he knows
Not infected: but if present
The abhorred ingredient in his eyes, make it known
As he has drunk, he splits his throat, his sides,
With violent weights. I drank,
and I saw the spider.
Camillo was his help, his accomplice:
There is a plot against my life, my crown;
Everything we are suspicious of is true: this false villain
The one I used was pre-employed by him:
He discovered my project, and I
Stay a pinched thing; yes, a very tip
So that they play at will. How did the posterns arrive?
So easy to open?

First Lord:
By his great authority;
Which has often prevailed no less than that
On your order.

LEONTES:
I do not know very well.
Give me the boy: I'm glad you didn't breastfeed him:
Although it bears some signs of me, yet you
He has too much blood in him.

HERMIONE:
What is this? sport?

LEONTES:
Take the boy from here; he will not come around her;
Far from him ! and let her play sports
With that, she is big; because it is Polixenes
It made you swell like this.

HERMIONE:
But I would say no,
And I will swear that you will believe what I say,
But you lean on the negative side.

LEONTES:
You, my lords,
Look at it, notice it carefully; be but about
To say "she's a good lady", and
The righteousness of your hearts will add to it
“It’s a shame she’s not honest, honorable:”
Praise her but for this form without a door,
Which, in my opinion, deserves a lofty and direct speech
The shrug, the hum or ha, those little marks
This slander uses... Oh, I'm out...
This mercy does, for slander will burn
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
When you said 'she's nice', put yourself in between
Before you can say "she's honest:" but don't be known,
Of the one who has the most reason to grieve, it should be,
She is an adulterous woman.

HERMIONE:
If a bad man says it,
The most regenerated villain in the world,
He was just as much more wicked: you, my lord,
Just fool yourself.

LEONTES:
You were wrong, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O you, thing!
That I will not call a creature from your home,
Lest barbarity, making me a precedent,
Should similar language be used across the board
And the polite distinction is left aside
Between the prince and the beggar: I said
She is an adulterous woman; I said with whom:
Plus, she's a traitor and Camillo is
A federal with her, and the one who knows
What she should be ashamed to know herself
But with her most vile director, that she is
A bed diverter, even as bad as these
Let the vulgar give the most daring titles, yes, and private
To this their late escape.

HERMIONE:
No, by my life.
Aware of none of this. How will this upset you?
When you come to clearer knowledge,
So you published me! Sweet my lord,
You can barely straighten me out completely by saying
You made a mistake.

LEONTES:
No; if I am wrong
In these foundations on which I build,
The center is not big enough to support
A school top. Far from her! in prison!
Whoever speaks for her is guilty by far
But that's what he's talking about.

HERMIONE:
There is a sick planet that reigns:
I must be patient until the sky looks
With a more favorable appearance. Good my lords,
I don't tend to cry, like our sex
Are usually ; the need for what vain dew
Perhaps it will dry up your pity: but I have
This honorable sorrow lodged here that burns
Worse than tears drown: I beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts as qualified as your charities
I will instruct you as best I can, measure me; and so
The king's will be executed!

LEONTES:
Should I be heard?

HERMIONE:
Who is accompanying me? Implore your Highness,
My wives can be with me; because you see
My fate demands it. Don't cry, good fools;
There is no cause: when you know your mistress
Deserved prison, then burst into tears
When leaving: this action, I continue now
It is for my best grace. Farewell, my lord:
I never wanted to see you sorry; NOW
I hope I will. My women, come; you have leave.

LEONTES:
Come on, do what we want; Thus!

First Lord:
Implore Your Highness, call the Queen again.

ANTIGONE :
Be sure of what you do, sir, lest your justice
Prove violence; in which three great ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen, your son.

First Lord:
For her, my lord,
I dare to risk my life and I will not do it, sir,
Please accept it, that the queen is impeccable
I have eyes from heaven and towards you; I mean,
In what you accuse him of.

ANTIGONE :
If it proves
It is otherwise, I will keep my stables where
I accommodate my wife; I will go as a couple with her;
That when I feel it and see it, I no longer trust it;
For every square inch of woman in the world,
Yes, every piece of woman's flesh is fake, if it exists.

LEONTES:
Keep your peace.

First Lord:
Well my lord,--

ANTIGONE :
We speak for you, not for ourselves:
You are abused and by a putter
It will be damned for that; had I known the wicked,
I would land, damn it. That she has a lack of honor,
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven years old
The second and the third, nine and about five;
If this turns out to be true, they will pay for it:
by my honor,
I will gel them all; fourteen they will not see,
Bringing false generations: they are joint heirs;
And I would have preferred to be casual rather than them
Shouldn't produce a fair issue.

LEONTES:
Cease; no more.
You feel this matter with such a cold sensation
Like a dead man's nose: but I see it and I feel it
As you feel while doing so; and see with
Instruments that feel.

ANTIGONE :
If this is so,
We don't need a grave to bury honesty:
There is not a grain of the face to soften
Of all the filthy earth.

LEONTES:
What! am I short of credit?

First Lord:
I would have preferred you to miss rather than me, my lord,
On this ground; and what's more it would please me
So that his honor is truer than your suspicions,
Take the blame however you may.

LEONTES:
Why, what do we need
Communicate with you about this, but instead follow
Our energetic instigation? Our prerogative
Call not your advice, but our natural goodness
Give this; and if you are amazed
Or who seems so competent, can't or won't
Savor a truth like us, get informed
We no longer need your advice: the matter,
The loss, the gain, the order, that's it
Properly ours.

ANTIGONE :
And I wish, my liege,
You had only tried it in your silent judgment,
Without more openness.

LEONTES:
How could this be?
Either you are the most ignorant by age,
Or you were born a fool. Camillo's escape,
Added to their familiarity,
Which was as crude as ever a touched conjecture,
He only lacked sight, nothing for approval
But only seeing, all other circumstances
Made in accordance with the act, he pushes this procedure:
Yet, for further confirmation,
Because in an act of this importance, there was
It's very pitiful to be wild, I mailed it
At sacred Delphos, at the temple of Apollo,
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Sufficient things: now from the oracle
They will bring everything; whose spiritual counsels had,
Must stop me or stimulate me. Did I do well?

First Lord:
Well done, my lord.

LEONTES:
Even though I'm satisfied and don't need more
That what I know, the oracle will do
Give rest to the minds of others, like him
Whose ignorant credulity
Come to the truth. So did we think it was good
Of our free person she should be confined,
Lest the betrayal of the two flee from here
Let her play. Come, follow us;
We must speak in public; for this matter
Will uplift us all.

ANTIGONE :

PAULINE:
The prison guard, call him;
let him know who I am.
Good lady,
No court in Europe is too good for you;
So what are you doing in prison?
Now, good sir,
You know me, don't you?

Gaoler:
For a worthy lady
And someone I honor very much.

PAULINE:
Please then,
Take me to the queen.

Gaoler:
I can't, ma'am:
On the contrary, I have an express command.

PAULINE:
So,
To lock up the honesty and honor of
Access for sweet visitors!
This is not legal, please,
To see his wives? any of them? Emily?

Gaoler:
So please, ma'am,
To set apart your servants, I
I will give birth to Emilia.

PAULINE:
I pray now, call her.
Withdraw.

Gaoler:
And, Madam,
I have to be at your conference.

PAULINE:
Well, don't be so, please.
Here is such noise to make no stain a stain
As the coloring progresses.
Dear lady,
How is our gracious lady?

EMILIE:
As one so great and so desperate
May they hold together: over their fears and their sorrows,
What ever tender lady was born greater,
It is something delivered before its time.

PAULINE:
A boy?

EMILIE:
A girl and a pretty baby,
Vigorous and loving to live: the queen receives
Lots of comfort in that; said "My poor prisoner,
I'm innocent like you.

PAULINE:
I dare to take an oath
These dangerous and dangerous moons for the king,
devour them!
You have to tell him, and he will: the office
Becomes a better woman; I will take care of it:
If I prove my honey mouth would let my tongue blister
And never in my red gaze will anger be
The trumpet, no more. I pray to you, Émilie,
Recommend my best obedience to the queen:
If she dares to entrust her little baby to me,
I will show it to the king and promise to be
His lawyer at his strongest. We do not know
How he can soften at the sight of the child:
The silence often of pure innocence
Convinces when words fail.

EMILIE:
Very worthy madam,
Your honor and goodness are so evident
That your free commitment cannot be lacking
A growing problem: there are no women alive
So get together for this big race. Please, Your Lady
To visit the next room, I will immediately
Inform the Queen of your noblest offer;
Who has not hammered home this design today,
But I didn't dare tempt an honorary minister,
Lest it be refused.

PAULINE:
Tell him, Emilia.
I will use this language of mine: if the mind arises from it
Like the boldness of my breast, let there be no doubt
I will do good.

EMILIE:
Now be happy about it!
I'm going to the queen: please,
approach something.

Gaoler:
Madam, please the queen to send the baby,
I don't know what I would incur to adopt him,
Having no mandate.

PAULINE:
You need not fear him, sir:
This child was trapped in the womb and is
By law and by a process of great nature
Freed and freed, not party to
The anger of the king nor guilty,
If there is, the queen's intrusion.

Gaoler:
I believe him.

PAULINE:
Do not fear: on my honor,
I will stand between you and danger.

LEONTES:
Neither night nor day, no rest: it is only weakness
Bear the matter thus; simple weakness. If
The cause was not existence, part of the cause,
She is the adulterous woman; for the harlot king
Is quite beyond my arm, out of nowhere
And at the level of my brain, proof of intrigue; but she
I can hold on: say she was gone,
Given to the fire, half of my rest
I might come back to me. Who is here?

First Servant:
My lord?

LEONTES:
How is the boy?

First Servant:
He rested well last night;
I hope his illness will be cured.

LEONTES:
To see its nobility!
Conceiving his mother's dishonor,
He directly refused, sank down, took it deep,
Tied up and repaired the shame in himself,
He lost his mind, his appetite, his sleep,
And downright languishing. Leave me alone: go,
See how he does.
Fi, fi! I didn't think about him:
The thought of my revenges this way
Stand back on me: in itself too powerful,
And in his parties, his alliance; let it be
Until a time has come: for present vengeance,
Take it out on her. Camillo and Polixenes
Laugh at me, make my sorrow their pastime:
They shouldn't laugh if I could reach them, nor
Is it in my power?

First Lord:
You must not enter.

PAULINE:
No, my good lords, be my second:
Do you fear his tyrannical passion more, alas,
What about the queen's life? a gracious and innocent soul,
More free than jealous.

ANTIGONE :
That's enough.

Second servant:
Madam, he did not sleep last night; order
No one should pick on him.

PAULINE:
Not so hot, good sir:
I'm coming to put him to sleep. It's like you,
who crawl like shadows near him and sigh
Everyone has their own useless gasps, like you
Nourish the cause of his awakening: I
Come with words as medicinal as they are true,
Honest too, to purge him of this humor
This wakes him up from sleep.

LEONTES:
What noise there, ho?

PAULINE:
No noise, my lord; but conference necessary
About some gossip about Your Highness.

LEONTES:
How!
Far from this daring lady! Antigone,
I charged you not to let her come to me:
I knew she would.

ANTIGONE :
I told him, my lord,
At my own risk,
She shouldn't visit you.

LEONTES:
What, you can't rule her?

PAULINE:
With all dishonesty, he can: in this,
Unless he takes the course you took,
Hire me for committing honor, trust him,
He will not rule me.

ANTIGONE :
Now you hear:
When she takes the reins, I'll let her run;
But she won't stumble.

PAULINE:
Well my lord, I am coming;
And, I beg you, listen to me, who professes
Myself, your faithful servant, your doctor,
Your most obedient advisor, but who dares
The less he will appear thus to console your ills,
That those who seem to be yours: I say, I come
Of your good queen.

LEONTES:
Good Queen !

PAULINE:
Good queen, my lord,
Good Queen ; I say good queen;
And the fight would make her good, me too
A man, the worst thing about you.

LEONTES:
Force her to leave.

PAULINE:
Than the one who only does trifles with his eyes
Give me first: of my own free will I go;
But first I'm going to run my errand. The good queen,
For she is good, she has given you a daughter;
So ; commend him to your blessing.

LEONTES:
Out!
A witch of humanity! So with her, outside:
One of the smartest whores!

PAULINE:
This is not the case :
I'm as ignorant as you on the subject
By allowing myself thus, and no less honest
Then you are crazy; which is enough, I guarantee,
In the world, pass as honest.

LEONTES:
Traitors!
Won't you push her away? Give him that bastard.
You idiot ! you are a tired woman, without rest
By your Lady Partlet here. Take this bastard;
Hurry up, I said; give it to your old wife.

PAULINE:
Forever
Invenerable are your hands, if you
Takes the princess by this forced baseness
Which he put on it!

LEONTES:
He fears his wife.

PAULINE:
So I would; then there was no longer any doubt
You would call your children your own.

LEONTES:
A nest of traitors!

ANTIGONE :
I am nothing, on this good day.

PAULINE:
Neither me nor anyone
But he who is here, and it is himself, for he
The sacred honor of himself, that of his queen,
Her hopeful son, her baby, betrays the slander,
Whose sting is sharper than that of the sword;
and I won't...
Because, as things stand, it's a curse
You can't force it...once it's removed
The root of his opinion, which is rotten
As always, the oak or stone was sound.

LEONTES:
A call
Of a limitless tongue, which belatedly beat her husband
And now it tempts me! This kid is none of mine;
This is the issue of the Polixenes:
So with him, and with the dam
Send them to the fire!

PAULINE:
It's yours;
And might we blame you for the old proverb:
So like you, it's the worst. Behold, my lords,
Even though the print is small, the whole deal
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
The thing of the frown, of his brow, no, of the valley,
The pretty dimples of his chin and his cheek,
His smiles,
The mold and the very structure of the hand, the nail, the finger:
And you, good goddess Nature, who made
So love the one who got it, if you got it
The order of the mind too, among all the colors
No yellow in it, lest she suspect, like him,
Her children, not her husband's!

LEONTES:
A rude witch
And, Lozel, you are worthy to be hanged,
That won't hold his tongue.

ANTIGONE :
Hang all the husbands
This can't do this feat, you'll leave yourself
Barely a subject.

LEONTES:
Again, take her from here.

PAULINE:
A most unworthy and unnatural lord
I can not stand it anymore.

LEONTES:
I'm going to make you burn.

PAULINE:
I do not care :
It's a heretic who sets the fire,
Not the one that burns inside. I will not call you a tyrant;
But this very cruel use of your queen,
Unable to produce more charges
That your own fragile imagination, something has taste
Of tyranny and the ignoble desire to surrender to you,
Yes, it's scandalous for the world.

LEONTES:
On your allegiance,
Get out of the room with her! If I were a tyrant,
Where was his life? she didn't dare call me that,
If she knew one of me. Far from her!

PAULINE:
Please don't push me; I will be gone.
Look at your baby, my lord; it's yours :
Jupiter sends it
A better guiding spirit! What do these hands need?
You who are so tender for his follies,
It will never do him any good, not any of you.
So, then: goodbye; we are gone.

LEONTES:
You, traitor, decided to do this with your wife.
My child? stay away from that! Even you, who have
A heart so tender for him, take it from here
And see him instantly consumed by fire;
Even you and no one but you. Take it straight:
In this hour, bring me a word, it's done,
And by a good testimony, or I will take possession of your life,
With what you call yours. If you refuse
And if you meet my anger, say so;
These bastard brains with my own hands
Should I rush. Go, take it to the fire;
Because you are attacking your wife.

ANTIGONE :
I didn't do it, sir:
These lords, my noble comrades, if they wish,
I can get away with it.

Lords:
We can: my royal liege,
He is not guilty of coming here.

LEONTES:
You are all liars.

First Lord:
Implore Your Highness, grant us better credit:
We have always truly served you and beg you
So to esteem ourselves, and on our knees we implore,
As a reward for our dear services
Past and future, as you change this goal,
What being so horrible, so bloody, must
This brings us to a disgusting problem: we all kneel.

LEONTES:
I am a feather for every wind that blows:
Do I have to live to see this bastard kneel
And call me father? you better burn it now
So curse him. But let it be so; let him live.
That won't be the case either. You, sir, come here;
You who have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
To save this bastard's life, because he's a bastard,
As sure as this beard is gray,
--what are you going to adventure
To save this kid's life?

ANTIGONE :
Anything, my lord,
That my capacity can endure
And the nobility imposes: at least this:
I'll pawn what little blood I have left
Saving the innocent: anything is possible.

LEONTES:
This will be possible. Swear by this sword
You will carry out my orders.

ANTIGONE :
I will, my lord.

LEONTES:
Mark and run it, you see! for failure
In any way, it will not only be
Death to yourself but to your obscene-tongued wife,
To whom for this time we forgive. We urge you,
As you are our cork man, you carry
That bastard is gone and you carry her
In an isolated and desert place
From our domains, and you leave it there,
Without further pity, for his own protection
And in favor of the climate. As if by a strange fortune
It has reached us, I charge you with justice,
On the peril of your soul and the torture of your body,
That you strangely recommend it somewhere
Where chance can cure it or put an end to it. Take it.

ANTIGONE :
I swear to do it, even if I'm dead present
He had been more merciful. Come on, poor baby:
A powerful spirit instructs kites and crows
To be your nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
Putting their wildness aside did it
Like pity offices. Sir, be prosperous
More than this act requires! And blessing
Against this cruelty fight at your side,
The poor man, condemned to ruin!

LEONTES:
No, I won't rise
Someone else's problem.

Servant:
Please, Your Highness, messages
From those you sent to the oracle came
An hour ago: Cleomenes and Dion,
Having arrived from Delphos, they both disembarked,
Rush to court.

First Lord:
So please, sir, their speed
It was beyond belief.

LEONTES:
Twenty-three days
They were absent: it's a good speed; predicted
The great Apollo will suddenly have
The truth appears. Prepare yourselves, lords;
Call a session, so we can bring to justice
Our most disloyal lady, for as she did
Was publicly accused, she will also have been
A fair and open trial. While she lives
My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me,
And consider my bidding.

CLEOMENE:
The climate is delicate, the air the sweetest,
Fertile the island, the temple far surpassing
The common praise he carries.

DION:
I will report,
For the most part it caught me, the heavenly habits,
I think that's what I should call them, and the curtsy
Grave bearers. O sacrifice!
How ceremonious, solemn and supernatural
It was my offering!

CLEOMENE:
But above all, the bursting
And the deafening voice of the oracle,
Parent of Jupiter's thunder, I have so surprised my senses.
That I was nothing.

DION:
If the travel event
Prove that you are so successful with the queen, oh!
How rare, pleasant, quick it was for us,
The time is worth it.

CLEOMENE:
Great Apollo
Turn everything towards the best! These proclamations,
So imposing faults on Hermione,
I don't like it much.

DION:
The violent transport of it
Will erase or end the affair: when the oracle,
Thus, by the great divine seal of Apollo,
Should the content discover something rare
Even then, one will rush towards knowledge. Come on: fresh horses!
And thank you be the problem!

LEONTES:
This session, to our great sorrow we pronounce,
Even against our hearts: the party tried
The daughter of a king, our wife and a
Of us too loved. Let's be clear
To be tyrannical, since we are so openly
Proceed to justice, which will take place in due time,
Even to the point of guilt or purgation.
Produce the prisoner.

Officer:
It is to the pleasure of Her Highness that the Queen
Appear in person here at the court. Silence!

LEONTES:
Read the indictment.

Officer:

HERMIONE:
Since what I have to say must be just that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The testimony from me no other
But what comes from me will hardly start me
To say “not guilty”: my integrity
Being considered a lie, as I express it,
Be thus received. But so: if the powers are divine
Contemplate our human actions, as they do,
I don't doubt it then but innocence will do
False accusation, redness and tyranny
Tremble with patience. You, my lord, know better,
Who will seem to do it least, my past life
Was as continent, as chaste, as true,
How unhappy I am now; what's more
That history can shape, although designed
And I played to attract spectators. Because here I am
A man of the royal bed, who must
One half of the throne, daughter of a great king,
The mother of a hopeful prince, standing here
To gossip and speak for life and honor before
To whom please come and hear. For life I appreciate it
As I weigh the sorrow, which I would spare: for honor,
It's a derivative of me to mine,
And that's just what I'm defending. I appeal
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
I have come to your court, as I was in your grace,
How deserved to be! since he came,
With what rare encounter I
I have tried to appear thus: if a word beyond
The bond of honor, either in act or in will
In this way hearts would harden
Of all who hear me and my closest relatives
Scream at my grave!

LEONTES:
I have never heard before
That one of these most daring vices wanted
Less impudence to challenge what they did
Than run it first.

HERMIONE:
This is true enough;
It's a saying, sir, it's not my fault.

LEONTES:
You will not own it.

HERMIONE:
More than mistress of
What comes to me in the name of a fault, I must not
I recognize it at all. For the Polixenes,
With whom I am accused, I admit
I loved him as he demanded in honor,
With the kind of love that could become
A lady like me, with love even like this,
Thus and no other, as you ordered:
What not having done, I think, was in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and your friend, of whom love had spoken,
Even if he could speak, since a baby, freely
That it was yours. Now for plot,
I don't know what it tastes like; even if it's flat
It's up to me to try how: everything I know about it
Was Camillo an honest man?
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
I'm not ignorant any more than I am.

LEONTES:
You knew of his departure, as you know
What you agreed to do in your absence.

HERMIONE:
Sir,
You speak a language that I don't understand:
My life lives up to your dreams,
Which I will file.

LEONTES:
Your actions are my dreams;
You had a bastard from Polixenes,
And I only had a dream about it. As you had overcome all shame,...
Those of your facts are so--so beyond all truth:
Which negates the concerns more than the advantages; for like
Your child was chased away, like himself,
No father owns it, which is indeed
You are more criminal than him, so you
You will feel our justice, in the easiest passage of which
Seek nothing less than death.

HERMIONE:
Sir, spare your threats:
The bug that you would scare me with, I'm looking for it.
For me, life cannot be a commodity:
The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,
I give lost; because I feel it's gone,
But I don't know how it happened. My second joy
And the first fruits of my body, of his presence
I'm crazy, like someone contagious. My third comfort
Unfortunately, Starr'd comes from my breast,
Innocent milk in her most innocent mouth,
Expelled to murder: myself on every message
Proclaimed a whore: with immodest hatred
The privilege of the refused crib, which “aspires
To women of all fashions; finally, in a hurry
Here, in this place, I'm out in the open, before
I have limit strength. Now, my lord,
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
That I would be afraid of dying? So continue.
But listen to this: make no mistake; no life,
I don't appreciate it with a straw, but for my honor,
That I would release, if I am condemned
On suppositions, all the evidence sleeps otherwise
But what do your jealousies awaken, I tell you
It is rigor and not law. Your honors to all,
I refer myself to the oracle:
Apollo be my judge!

First Lord:
This is your request
It is absolutely right: therefore give birth,
And in the name of Apollo, his oracle.

HERMIONE:
The Emperor of Russia was my father:
Oh, if he were alive, and seeing here
His daughter's trial! what he did but saw
The flatness of my misery, but with eyes
Pity, not revenge!

Officer:
You swear here on this sword of justice,
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
I have been both to Delphos, and from there I brought back
The sealed oracle, delivered by the hand
From the priest of the great Apollo; and that, since then,
You did not dare to break the sacred seal
Nor read the secrets.

CLEOMENE:
All this, we swear.

LEONTES:
Break the seals and read.

Officer:

Lords:
Now, blessed be the great Apollo!

HERMIONE:
Praised!

LEONTES:
Have you read the truth?

Officer:
Yes my Lord ; anyway
As shown here.

LEONTES:
There is no truth in the oracle:
The sessions will continue: it's all a lie.

Servant:
My lord the king, the king!

LEONTES:
What's the deal?

Servant:
O sir, I would hate to point it out!
The prince your son, with simple vanity and fear
The queen's speed is gone.

LEONTES:
How! disappeared!

Servant:
Is dead.

LEONTES:
Apollo is angry; and the heavens themselves
Strike my injustice.
How now there!

PAULINE:
This news is deadly for the queen: look down
And see what death does.

LEONTES:
So take her:
His heart is only overloaded; she will recover:
I believed my own suspicions too much:
I beg you, apply yourself tenderly to her
Some remedies for life.
Apollo, sorry
My great rudeness against your oracle!
I will reconcile with Polixène,
New court my queen, remember the good Camillo,
May I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
Because, being transported by my jealousies
To bloody thoughts and revenge I chose
Camillo so that the minister poisons
My friend Polixenes: what was done,
But Camillo's good spirit was delayed
My prompt command, even though I am with death and with
The reward threatened and encouraged him,
Not to do it and to be done: he, the most human
And filled with honor, to my royal guest
I detached my office, I abandoned his fortune here,
That you knew very well, and at great risk
Of all certainties he himself praised,
No richer than his honor: how it shines
Get rid of my rust! and how his pity
Do my actions make the darkest!

PAULINE:
Unfortunately for the moment!
Oh, cut my lace, lest my heart break,
Break too.

First Lord:
What is it about, good lady?

PAULINE:
What studied torments, tyrant, do you have for me?
What wheels? shelves ? fires? what skin? boiling?
In leads or oils? what ancient or more recent torture
Shall I receive, whose every word deserves
To taste your worst? Your tyranny
Working together with your jealousies,
Fantasies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For nine year old girls, oh, think of what they've done
And then go really crazy, completely crazy! for everyone
Your past follies were just spices.
That you betrayed Polixenes was nothing;
It only showed you, a fool, fickle
And damn ungrateful: and it wasn't much either,
You would have poisoned the honor of good Camillo,
To make him kill a king: poor offenses,
An even more monstrous wait: what I think
The launch of the crows your little girl
To be or nothing or little; although a devil
I would have poured water from the fire before not doing it:
And the death is not directly attributed to you
Of the young prince, whose honorable thoughts,
High thoughts for someone so tender who broke the heart
Who could conceive a rude and foolish father
Has stained his gracious mother: it is not, no,
Asked to your answer: but the last, - oh lords,
When I said, shout “woe!” the queen, the queen,
The sweetest and dearest creature is dead,
and revenge for that
Not yet filed.

First Lord:
Higher powers forbid!

PAULINE:
I say she is dead; I won't swear to it. If word or oath
Don't prevail, go and see: if you can bring
Dye or luster in his lip, his eye,
Heat out or breathe in, I'll serve you
As I would do the gods. But, oh tyrant!
Do not repent of these things, for they are heavier
That all your misfortunes can stir; so take yourself
Nothing but despair. A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
On a barren mountain and still winter
In a perpetual storm the gods could not move
You were this way.

LEONTES:
Come on, keep going
You can't talk too much; I deserved
All tongues speak most bitterly.

First Lord:
Say no more:
No matter how things go, you are at fault
I have the audacity of your speech.

PAULINE:
I'm sorry about that :
All the mistakes I make, when I know them,
I repent. Alas! I showed too much
The temerity of a woman: he is touched
With a noble heart. What is gone and what is the past help
Must be beyond sorrow: receive no affliction
To my petition; I beg you instead
Let me be punished, it bothered you
What to forget. Now, well my lord
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
The love I had for your queen... there you go, stupid again!...
I will no longer speak of her, nor of your children;
I will not remember you from my own lord,
Who is also lost: have patience with you,
And I won't say anything.

LEONTES:
You spoke but well
When it's the truth; that I receive much better
Than to have pity on you. Please take me
To the corpses of my queen and my son:
One grave will be for both: on them will be
The causes of their death appear,
Our perpetual shame. Once a day I will visit
The chapel where they rest and the tears flow there
Will be my recreation: as long as nature
I will endure this exercise, see you soon
I commit to using it daily. Come and lead me
To these sorrows.

ANTIGONE :
You are then perfect, our ship has touched
The deserts of Bohemia?

Marine:
Yes, my lord: and fear
We landed at the wrong time: the sky is dark
And threaten the current boasting. In my consciousness,
The heavens with what we have in hand are angry
And disapprove of them.

ANTIGONE :
Their sacred wishes be done! Come on, get on board;
Look at your bark: I won't be long before
I invoke you.

Marine:
Do your best and don't leave
Too far in the earth: it is as if it were noisy weather;
Additionally, this place is famous for the creatures
Prey that takes care of it.

ANTIGONE :
Go away :
I will follow instantly.

Marine:
I'm happy deep down
To be so clear of affairs.

ANTIGONE :
Come, poor baby:
I heard, but I did not believe,
the spirits of the dead
Can walk again: if this is the situation, your mother
It dawned on me last night, because there was never a dream
So like a wake-up call. For me comes a creature,
Sometimes his head on one side, others on the other;
I have never seen a ship so sad,
So full and so becoming: in dresses of pure white,
As in all holiness, she approached
My cabin where I rest; three times I bowed before me,
And panting to start a speech, her eyes
Become two beaks: the fury spent, immediately
Did this escape him: “Good Antigone,
Since destiny, against your better disposition,
Made your person for the pitcher
Of my poor child, according to your oath,
Quite remote places are in Bohemia,
There, cry and let him cry; and, for the baby
Is counted lost forever, Perdita,
Please call me. For this not very sweet affair
Placed on you by my lord, you will never see
Your wife Paulina again. And so, with cries
She melted into the air. Very scared,
I pulled myself together over time and thought
It was like that and no sleep. Dreams are toys:
However, for this time, yes, out of superstitiousness,
I'll be square with that. I believe
Hermione suffered death, and this
Apollo would do it, that's the problem
Of King Polixenes it should be laid here,
Either for life or for death, on earth
From his good father. Blossom, go quickly!
There are found, and there is your character: there these;
Who can, if fortune pleases, beget you both, pretty,
And always rest yours. The storm begins; poor wretch,
That, through your mother's fault, you are thus exposed
To loss and what may follow! Cry, I can't,
But my heart bleeds; and I am the most cursed
He is required to do so by oath. Farewell!
The day frowns more and more: you would like to have
A lullaby that's too harsh: I've never seen
The skies are so dark during the day. A wild clamor!
Well, can I come on board! It's hunting:
I'm gone forever.

Shepherd:
I wish there was no age between sixteen and
twenty-three years old, or that young people slept all night
rest; because there is nothing in between but
get girls pregnant, harm seniority,
fly, fight... Listen to me now! Does anyone but
these boiled brains of nineteen and twenty-two
hunting in this weather? They scared two of my
best sheep, which I fear the wolf will find sooner
that the master: if there are any where I have them, it is through
the seaside, the grazing of ivy. Good luck, and don't be yours
what do we have here! Pity for 's, a barne a very
rather banal! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
Pretty; a very pretty one: of course, a little landscape:
even if I am not bookish, I can still read
lady waiting in the landscape. It was
stair work, trunk work, others
work behind the door: they were hotter than those who had that
that the poor thing is there. I will take it for
too bad: yet I will wait until my son comes; he hallucinated
but even now. Wow, ho, ho!

Clown:
Hilloa, Loa!

Shepherd:
What, are you so close? If you see something to talk about
When you're dead and rotten, come here. What
have you, man?

Clown:
I have seen two of these sites, by sea and by land!
but I do not say that it is a sea, because it is now the
sky: between the firmament and it, you cannot push
a sensitive point.

Shepherd:
Why, boy, how are you?

Clown:
I would have liked you to do it, but see how it irritates, how it rages,
how it invades the shore! but it is not the
indicate. O the most pitiful cry of poor souls!
sometimes to see them, and not to see them; now the
ship piercing the moon with its main mast, and soon
swallowed with yes and foam, as one would push a
cork in a ton. And then for the
land service, to see how the bear tore his
shoulder bone; how he called me for help and told me
his name was Antigone, a nobleman. But to make a
end of the ship, to see how the sea beat its dragon
but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
the sea made fun of them; and how the poor gentleman roared
and the bear laughed at him, both roaring louder than
the sea or the weather.

Shepherd:
For God's sake, when was that, my boy?

Clown:
Now, now: I haven't winked since I saw this
views: men are not yet cold under water, nor
the bear has half dined on monsieur: he is there
NOW.

Shepherd:
Would I have been there to help the old man!

Clown:
I wish you were on the ship to have
helped her: there your charity would have lacked foundation.

Shepherd:
Heavy is heavy! heavy things! but look at you here,
boy. Now bless you: you have encountered things
dying, I'm with newborn things. Here is a view for
you; look, a garment for a squire
child! look at you here; take, take, my boy;
open it. So let's see: I was told I should be
rich by fairies. He's a changeling:
open it. What's in it, boy?

Clown:
You are an old man: if the sins of your youth
we forgive you, you will live well. Gold! all in gold!

Shepherd:
It's fairy gold, boy, and this will prove it:
with this, keep it close to you: home, home, the next way.
We're lucky, boy; and to be so, it is still necessary
nothing but the secret. Let my sheep go: come, well
my boy, the next way back.

Clown:
Go in the next direction with your findings. I'll go see
if the bear disappeared from the gentleman and how much
he ate: they are never cursed but when they
I'm hungry: if there's any left, I'll bury it
he.

Shepherd:
It's a good deed. If you can discern by this
what remains of him what he is, take me to
his view.

Clown:
Get married, I will; and you will help put him down.

Shepherd:
It's a lucky day, my boy, and we will do good deeds because of it.

Time:
Me, it pleases some people, I try everything, both joy and terror
Of good and evil, it makes and unfolds error,
Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
To use my wings. To impute is not a crime
Towards me or my rapid passage, that I slide
O'er sixteen years and let growth without trial
From this wide gap, since it is in my power
To overthrow the law and in a single hour
Planting and submerging custom. Let me pass
The same as I am, before the order of elders was created
Or what is now received: I testify of
The moments that led to them; then I will do
To the freshest things that now reign and make obsolete
The sparkle of this gift, like my tale
It seems now. Your patience allowing,
I swirl my glass and give my scene such growth
As you slept between: Leontes leaving,
The effects of his tender jealousies so painful
Let him be silent, imagine me,
Sweet spectators, that I may now be
In beautiful Bohemia, and remember well,
I mentioned a son of the king, that Florizel
I name you now; and with speed therefore rhythm
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
It's equal to wondering: what follows from her
I am not listing the prophecies; but let the Time news
Know when he will be born.
Daughter of a shepherd,
And what does she adhere to, the following,
This is the argument of Time. From this authorization,
If you've ever had a worse time before;
If ever, Time itself says so
He sincerely wishes you never could.

POLIXENES:
I pray you, good Camillo, be no longer intrusive:
it’s an illness that denies you anything; a death to
grant it.

CAMILLO:
It has been fifteen years since I last saw my country: yet
I was broadcast mostly abroad, I
desire to lay my bones there. Moreover, the penitent
the king, my master, sent for me; to whose feeling
the sorrows, I could be a soothe, or I moved on to
I think so, which is another incentive for me to leave.

POLIXENES:
As you love me, Camillo, don't erase the rest of
your services in leaving me now: the need I have for
it is you that your goodness has created; better not to do it
I only wanted you like this: you, having
made me deals that no one can without you
manage sufficiently, must either stay to execute
or take them with you yourself
services you have rendered; and if I don't have enough
considered, as I cannot really say, as being more
I will be grateful to you for my study and my profit
therein abundant friendships. Of this fatal
country, Sicily, please speak no more; of which very
naming punishes me with the memory of it
penitent, as you call him, and reconciled king,
My brother; including the loss of its most precious queen
and children must still be deplored today.
Tell me, when did you see Prince Florizel, my
son? Kings are no less unhappy, their problem is not
being lovable, than they are by losing them when
they approved their virtues.

CAMILLO:
Sir, it's been three days since I saw the prince. What
his happiest affairs perhaps, are unknown to me: but I
I noted it by mistake, he recently retired
of the court and is less frequent with his prince
exercises that once appeared.

POLIXENES:
I thought a lot, Camillo, and with some
care; until now I have eyes at my service that
look at its distance; who do I get this from
intelligence, that he is rarely from the house of a
the simplest shepherd; a man, they say, who comes from
very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
neighbors, has become an indescribable domain.

CAMILLO:
I have heard of such a man, sir, who has a
daughter of rarest note: the report of her is
extended more than one might think from such a chalet.

POLIXENES:
This is also part of my intelligence; but I
the fear, the angle that draws our son there. You
you will accompany us to this place; where we will do it, not
appearing what we are, I have some questions with the
shepherd; of whose simplicity I do not think
I am worried about the reason for my son's stay there.
Please be my present partner in this matter, and
leave aside thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I willingly obey your orders.

POLIXENES:
My best Camillo! We have to disguise ourselves.

AUTOLYCUS:
When the daffodils begin to peer,
With height! the doxy on the valley,
Well, then comes the sweet year;
For red blood reigns in the paleness of winter.
The white sheet whitening on the hedge,
With height! the sweet birds, oh how they sing!
It puts a strain on my tooth;
Because a liter of beer is a dish for a king.
The lark, this tirra-lyra sings,
With height! with height! the thrush and the jay,
These are summer songs for me and my aunts,
While we fall in the hay.
I served Prince Florizel and, in my time
wore three hairs; but now I'm out of service:
But should I mourn this, my dear?
The pale moon shines at night:
And when I wander here and there,
So most of the time I go to the right.
If tinkerers can be allowed to live,
And supports the pigskin budget,
So my account, I can give it well,
And in stocks, attest to it.
My traffic is made up of leaves; when the kite is built, look towards
less laundry. My father called me Autolycus; WHO
being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was also
a glimpse of thoughtless trifles. With dying and
dull, I bought this caparison, and my income is
the idiot cheater. The gallows and the blow are too powerful
on the highway: beatings and hangings are terrors for
me: for the life to come, I sleep without thinking about it
of it. A price! a price!

Clown:
Let me see: every eleven days, at least; every tod
gives odd pounds and shillings; fifteen hundred
bare. what is wool used for?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
I can't do it without counters. Let me see; What am I
Should I buy for our sheep shearing party? Three books
of sugar, five pounds of currants, rice, what will
my sister makes rice? But my father
has made her mistress of the feast, and she sets it down
on. She made me twenty-four gay noses for
the shearers, three men-singers all, and very good
those; but these are for the most part means and bases; but
a Puritan among them, and he sings psalms to
bagpipes. I need saffron to color the guardian
pies; mass; dates ? – none, this does not appear in my note;
nutmeg, seven; a run or two of ginger, but that I
can beg; four pounds of prunes, and as many
raisins of the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
O that I was born!

Clown:
I am my name...

AUTOLYCUS:
Oh, help me, help me! tear off these rags; And
then, death, death!

Clown:
Alas, poor soul! you need more rags to put on
on you, rather than taking them off.

AUTOLYCUS:
O sir, their repugnance offends me more
that the blows I received, which are powerful
ones and millions.

Clown:
Alas, poor guy! a million blows can happen to one
big deal.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and my clothes
taken from me, and these hateful things put on me
Me.

Clown:
What, by a knight or a footman?

AUTOLYCUS:
A footman, my dear sir, a footman.

Clown:
Indeed, he must be a footman by the clothes he wears.
left with you: if it is a rider's tunic,
he experienced very warm service. Give me your hand,
I will help you: come, lend me your hand.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, tenderly, O!

Clown:
Alas, poor soul!

AUTOLYCUS:
Oh, good sir, gently, good sir! I fear, sir, my
the scapula is out.

Clown:
How now! you can't stand up?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Are you short of money? I have some money for you.

AUTOLYCUS:
No, my dear sir; no, I beg you, sir: I have
a relative less than three-quarters of a mile from here,
who I was going to; I will have money there, or
whatever I want: don't offer me money, please;
It kills my heart.

Clown:
What kind of man was the one who stole from you?

AUTOLYCUS:
A guy, sir, with whom I experienced trips
troll-ladies; I once knew him as a servant of
prince: I cannot say, good sir, for which of his
they were virtues, but he was certainly thrown out of court.

Clown:
Its vices, you would say; there is no whipped virtue
off the field: they cherish him to make him stay
there; and yet he will only remain.

AUTOLYCUS:
Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
he has since been carrying monkeys; then a
a bailiff ; then he traveled a
motion of the prodigal son, and married a handyman
my wife less than a mile from where my land and life are;
and, having flown over many rogue trades, he
installed only in rogue: some call it Autolycus.

Clown:
On him ! idiot, for my life, prig: it haunts
wakes, fairs and bear fights.

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, sir; him, sir, him; it's the thug who
put me in these clothes.

Clown:
There is no more cowardly rascal in all Bohemia: if you had
but if he had looked big and spat at him, he would have run.

AUTOLYCUS:
I must confess to you, sir, I am not a fighter: I am
false of heart in this way; and that he knew, I guarantee it
him.

Clown:
How are you now ?

AUTOLYCUS:
Gentle sir, much better than me; I can stand and
walk: I will even take leave of you, and walk
gently towards that of my parent.

Clown:
Should I take you on the way?

AUTOLYCUS:
No, sir, good face; no, my dear sir.

Clown:
So, good luck: I have to go buy spices for our
shearing sheep.

AUTOLYCUS:
Prosper, sweet sir!
Your purse is not warm enough to buy your spices.
I will also be with you at your sheep shearing: if I
don't make this cheater bring out another one and
the shearers prove the sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
put in the book of virtue!
Keep jogging, keep jogging, on the trail path,
And happily style-a:
A cheerful heart goes all day,
Your sad tires in a mile-a.

FLORISEL:
These are your unusual weeds for every part of you
Give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
Looking ahead to April. It's your sheep's shearing
It's like a meeting of the little gods,
And you, the queen, no.

PERDITA:
Sir, my gracious lord,
It does not suit me to reprimand your extremes:
Oh, sorry, let me name them! Your elevated self,
The gracious mark of the earth, you have darkened
With a groom's suit, and I, poor humble servant,
Most of the pranks of goddesses: but that our parties
In every mess there is madness and mangers
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
To see you dressed like this, I swear, I think,
To show me a glass.

FLORISEL:
I bless the time
When my good hawk flew through
Your father's land.

PERDITA:
Now, Jupiter gives you the means!
For me, difference breeds fear; your greatness
Wasn't used to being afraid. Even now I'm shaking
To think that your father, by accident,
We should pass through here as you did: O the Fates!
What would it look like, to see his work so noble
Vilely bound? What would he say? Or how
Should I, in these borrowed displays, see
The severity of his presence?

FLORISEL:
Apprehend
Nothing but joy. The gods themselves,
Humiliating their deities to love, took
The shapes of the beasts on them: Jupiter
Became a bull and bellowed; the green Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and the god in the robe of fire,
Golden Apollo, poor and humble servant,
As it seems to me now. Their transformations
Never has a piece of beauty been more rare,
Nor in such a chaste manner, since my desires
Do not run before my honor nor my lusts
Burns brighter than my faith.

PERDITA:
Oh, but, sir,
Your resolution cannot stand, when it is
Opposed, as it should be, to the power of the king:
One of these two must be a necessity,
Which will then say that you must
change this objective,
Or me, my life.

FLORISEL:
You, dearest Perdita,
With these forced thoughts, please don't get dark
The joy of the party. Or I will be yours, my beautiful,
Or not my father's. Because I can't be
Mine, nor anything to anyone, if
I'm not yours. To this I am most constant,
Even if fate says no. Be joyful, gentle;
Strangle such thoughts with anything
That you see the moment. Your guests are arriving:
Raise your face like it's day
Of the celebration of these weddings which
We both swore we would come.

PERDITA:
O Lady Fortune,
Be a good omen!

FLORISEL:
See, your guests are approaching:
Address to entertain them cheerfully,
And let's be red with joy.

Shepherd:
Fi, my daughter! when my old wife lived, on
That day, she was pannier, butler, cook,
Both lady and servant; welcomed everyone, served everyone;
Would sing his song and dance in turn; nowhere,
At the top end of the table, now I'm in the middle;
On his shoulder, and hers; his fiery face
With work and what she took to appease her,
She would each take a sip. You are retired,
As if you were a treat and no
Meeting Hostess: Please bid
These unknown friends are welcome; because it is
A way to make better, better known friends.
Come quench your blushes and introduce yourself
What you are, mistress of the feast: go,
And welcome us to your shearing of sheep,
How your good flock will prosper.

PERDITA:

POLIXENES:
Shepherdess,
You're just - well, you match our age
With winter flowers.

PERDITA:
Sir, the year is getting older,
Not yet on Summer's death, nor on the birth
Of the trembling winter, the most beautiful
seasonal flowers
Are our carnations and ridged gillyvors,
What some call nature's bastards: like this
Our rustic garden is barren; and I don't care
To obtain extracts.

POLIXENES:
Therefore, sweet girl,
Are you neglecting them?

PERDITA:
Because I heard
There is an art which in its foot shares
With a great creative nature.

POLIXENES:
Say there is;
Yet nature is in no way improved
But nature makes it wicked: so, about this art
What you say adds to nature, it's an art
It’s nature that does it. You see, sweet lady, we are getting married
A gentler descendant of the wilder strain,
And have a lower type bark designed
By bud of nobler breed: it is an art
What repairs nature, rather changes it, but
Art itself is nature.

PERDITA:
So it's.

POLIXENES:
So make your garden rich in wallflowers,
And don't call them bastards.

PERDITA:
I will not put
Dig it in the ground to plant a single piece;
No more than if I were painted, I would wish
This young person should say "everything is fine and only for this reason"
Desire to reproduce. Here are flowers for you;
Zesty lavender, mints, savory, marjoram;
The worry, which sets with the sun
And with him rises crying: they are flowers
Midsummer, and I think they're given
To middle-aged men. It was nothing.

CAMILLO:
I would leave the pasture if I were of your flock,
And live only by watching.

PERDITA:
Out, alas!
You would be so skinny, these January explosions
Would blow you through and through.
Now, my best friend,
I wish I had flowers in spring that could
Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
which still bear your virgin branches
Your virgins are growing: O Proserpina,
For the flowers now, which scared you, let's forget
From the wagon of Dis! daffodils,
Who come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty; the violets are extinguished,
But softer than Juno's eyelids
Or the breath of Cytherea; pale primroses
Who die single, before they can see
Bight Phoebus in his strength - a disease
What concerns the maids the most; bold beef lips and
The imperial crown; lilies of all kinds,
The Luce flower is one of them! Oh, I miss those,
To make you garlands, and my sweet friend,
To spread it again and again!

FLORISEL:
What, like a corpse?

PERDITA:
No, like a bank on which love can lie and gamble;
Not like a corpse; or if, in order not to be buried,
But quickly and in my arms. Come, take your flowers:
I think I play like I saw them do
In the Pentecost pastorals: of course, my dress
It changes my character.

FLORISEL:
What are you doing
What is done is even better. When you speak, my sweet.
I would ask you to always do this: when you sing,
I would ask you to buy and sell like this, so give alms,
Pray thus; and, for the order of your affairs,
To sing them too: when you dance, I wish you
A wave of the sea, that you could one day make
Just that ; always moves, always like this,
And has no other function: everyone does what they do,
So singular in each individual,
Crown what you do in this act,
That all your actions are queens.

PERDITA:
O Doriculus,
Your praises are too great: but your youth,
And the true blood that shines through fairly,
Give you clearly a shepherd without spot,
With wisdom I could fear, my Doricule,
You courted me wrongly.

FLORISEL:
I think you have
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
To get you started. But come; our dance, I pray:
Your hand, my Perdita: thus the turtles mate,
This never means separating.

PERDITA:
I will swear for them.

POLIXENES:
She's the prettiest low-born girl that ever lived.
Ran across the green lawn: nothing she does or seems
But it smells of something bigger than itself,
Too noble for this place.

CAMILLO:
He says something to her
This shows her blood: of course she is
The queen of curds and cream.

Clown:
Come on, get started!

DORCAS:
Mopsa must be your mistress: wife, garlic,
To repair his kiss with!

MOPSA:
Now, in time!

Clown:
Not a word, a word; we stay true to our ways.
Come, get started!

POLIXENES:
Pray, good shepherd, what a beautiful swain this is
What dances with your daughter?

Shepherd:
It is called Doriculus; and brags
To have a decent diet: but I have it
According to his own report and I believe him;
He looks calm. He says he loves my daughter:
I think so too; because I never looked at the moon
On the water as he stands and reads
Like my daughter's eyes: and, to be clear.
I think there's not half a kiss to choose
Who loves another better.

POLIXENES:
She dances brilliantly.

Shepherd:
So she does anything; even if I point it out,
This should be silent: if young Doricule
Shed the light on her, she will bring him what
Which he doesn't dream of.

Servant:
O master, if only you could hear the peddler at
door, you would never dance again after a tabor and
pipe; no, the bagpipes could not move you: he sings
several pieces faster than you'd say for the money; he
pronounces them as he had eaten ballads and all men
ears grew to the sound of his music.

Clown:
He could never do better; he will enter. I
I love ballads but even too good, if it's lugubrious
cheerfully laid-back affair, or a very pleasant thing
indeed and sung miserably.

Servant:
It has songs for men or women, of all sizes; No
the milliner can thus put gloves on his customers: he
he has the prettiest love songs for maids; so without
cheerfulness, which is strange; with such delicacy
burdens of dildos and fades, jump it and bang
her;' and where a long-mouthed rascal would do it,
so to speak, to do mischief and make a dent in
the affair, he makes the maid respond "Whoop, make me
no harm, good man; rejects him, despises him, with
“Oop, don’t hurt me, good man.”

POLIXENES:
He is a courageous man.

Clown:
Believe me, you are talking about an admirable conceit
companion. Does it have non-braided items?

Servant:
It has ribbons in the colors of the rainbow;
points more than all the lawyers of Bohemia can
handle wisely, although they come to him through the
raw: inkles, caddis, cambric, lawns: why, it
he sings them as if they were gods or goddesses; You
I would think a blouse was an angel, he sings like this
to the sleeve and to work on the square.

Clown:
Please bring him; and let him approach the song.

PERDITA:
Warn him not to use slanderous words in the air of .

Clown:
You have these peddlers, who have more in them
than you think, sister.

PERDITA:
Yes, my brother, or think about it.

AUTOLYCUS:
Lawn as white as beaten snow;
Cyprus black as always a raven;
Gloves as soft as Damascus roses;
Face and nose masks;
Bugle bracelet, amber necklace,
Perfume for lady's room;
Golden quiffs and stomachs,
For my guys to give to their darlings:
Steel pins and poking sticks,
What the maids lack from head to toe:
Come buy me, come; come buy, come buy;
Buy guys, otherwise your girls are screaming: come buy.

Clown:
If I wasn't in love with Mopsa, you would have to take
no money from me; but being fascinated as I am, it's
will also be the bondage of some ribbons and gloves.

MOPSA:
They had promised me against the party; but they come
it's not too late now.

DORCAS:
He promised you more than that, otherwise there would be liars.

MOPSA:
He has paid you everything he promised you; maybe he has
paid you more, which will make you ashamed to pay it back to him again.

Clown:
Are there no more good manners among the servants? will they
carry their paws where they should carry their
faces? Isn't it milking time when you're
go to bed, or to the oven, to whistle these
secrets, but you have to talk first
our guests? it's good that they whisper: clamor
your tongues, and not a word more.

MOPSA:
I did. Come, you promised me vulgar lace
and a pair of pretty gloves.

Clown:
Didn't I tell you how dismayed I was by the way
and I lost all my money?

AUTOLYCUS:
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
it is therefore up to men to be wary.

Clown:
Don't be afraid, man, you won't lose anything here.

AUTOLYCUS:
I hope so, sir; because I have many free packages with me.

Clown:
What's here? ballads?

MOPSA:
Pray now, buy some: I like a printed ballad o'
life, because then we are sure that they are true.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here is one in a very mournful tone, how a loan shark
his wife was brought to bed with twenty bags of money at a
burden and how much she wanted to eat the heads of vipers and
charred toads.

MOPSA:
Is this true, do you think?

AUTOLYCUS:
This is very true, and it's only a month old.

DORCAS:
Bless me for marrying a loan shark!

AUTOLYCUS:
This is the name of the midwife, a mistress
Bearer of tales and five or six honest wives who were
here. Why should I carry lies abroad?

MOPSA:
Please buy it now.

Clown:
Come on, forget it: and first let's see more
ballads; we will buy the other things right away.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here is another ballad from a fish, which appeared on
the coast on Wednesday the eighties of April,
forty thousand fathoms above the water, and I sang this
ballad against the hard hearts of the servants: it was
I thought she was a woman and she turned into a cold
fish because she would not exchange flesh with him who
loved him: the ballad is very pitiful and just as true.

DORCAS:
Is this true too, do you think?

AUTOLYCUS:
Five judges take care of it and more witnesses
my bag will hold.

Clown:
Leave it too: another.

AUTOLYCUS:
It's a joyous ballad, but very pretty.

MOPSA:
Let's make it joyful.

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, it's a happy passing party and she's going to
the tune of “Two maids courting a man”: there is
there is hardly a servant towards the west but she sings it; it's in
ask, I can tell you.

MOPSA:
We can both sing it: if you have a part of it, you
you will hear; it's in three parts.

DORCAS:
We listened to the music just a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS:
I can support my role; you should know it's my
occupation; go with you.

AUTOLYCUS:
Get out of the way, because I have to go
Not sure where this fits you.

DORCAS:
Or?

MOPSA:
Oh, where?

DORCAS:
Or?

MOPSA:
This very well becomes your oath,
It's you who tells me your secrets.

DORCAS:
Me too, let me go.

MOPSA:
Or you go to the orange or the mill.

DORCAS:
If so, you will be sick.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
What, neither?

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
You swore my love was.

MOPSA:
You swore to me more:
So where are we going? say, where?

Clown:
We're going to release this song later by ourselves: my
my father and these gentlemen are discussing sadly, and we are going
not disturb them. Come on, bring your bag back later
Me. Girls, I will buy for you both. Peddler, let's go
have first choice. Follow me, girls.

AUTOLYCUS:
And you will pay them well.
Will you buy a cassette,
Or lace for your cape,
My delicious duck, my darling?
Any silk, any thread,
Toys for your head,
The newest, finest, finest clothes?
Come to the peddler;
Money is an intruder.
This speaks all the speeches of men.

Servant:
Master, there are three carters, three shepherds,
three herds cared for, three herds of pigs, which made
themselves all men of hair, they are called
jumpers, and they do a dance that the girls
say that it's a gallimaufrie of frolics, because they are
no way; but they themselves are out of mind, if it is
don't be too hard on those who know little but
bowling, he will thoroughly enjoy it.

Shepherd:
Far! we won't answer them: there have been too many here
already simple nonsense. I know, sir, we are tiring you.

POLIXENES:
You tire those who refresh us: pray, let's see
these four three of shepherds.

Servant:
One three of them, according to their own report, sir, have
danced before the king; and not the worst
three but jumps twelve and a half feet by the squier.

Shepherd:
Leave your chatter: since these good people are
happy, let them in; but quickly now.

Servant:
Well, they stay at the door, sir.

POLIXENES:
O my father, you will know more later.
Hasn't this gone too far? It's time to separate them.
It is simple and tells a lot.
Well, beautiful shepherd!
Your heart is full of something that takes
Your mind to feast. Sooth, when I was young
And I gave love like you do, I used to
To load my wife with talents: I would have trashed
The peddler's silk treasure and I poured it out
Upon its acceptance; you let him go
And nothing happened to him. If your daughter
The interpretation should abuse and call this
Your lack of love or generosity, you were cramped
For an answer, at least if you care
To be happy to hold her in my arms.

FLORISEL:
Old man, I know
She does not appreciate such trifles as these:
The gifts she expects from me are wrapped and locked
In my heart ; which I have already given,
But not delivered. O, hear me breathe my life
In front of this old gentleman who, it seems,
I already liked it! I take your hand, this hand,
As soft as a dove's down and as white as it,
Or the Ethiopian tooth, or the fan
snow that is bolted
By the explosions from the north, twice.

POLIXENES:
What follows this?
How beautifully the groom seems to wash
The hand was just before! I kicked you out:
But to your protest; let me listen
What you profess.

FLORISEL:
Do it and witness it.

POLIXENES:
And that, my neighbor too?

FLORISEL:
And him, and more
That he, and men, the earth, the heavens and all:
If I were crowned the most imperial monarch,
Whose most worthy, was I the most beautiful young
Who always made the eyes deviate, had strength and knowledge
More than ever that of men, I would not appreciate them
Without his love; for her, use them all;
Praise and condemn them for his service
Or to their own perdition.

POLIXENES:
Enough offer.

CAMILLO:
This shows strong affection.

Shepherd:
But, my daughter,
Do you tell him that?

PERDITA:
I can not talk
So, nothing so good; no, that doesn't mean better:
By the pattern of my own thoughts I cut
Its purity.

Shepherd:
Take your hand, a good deal!
And, unknown friends, you will bear witness to this:
I give him my daughter and I will make him
His share is equal to his.

FLORISEL:
O, it must be
I have the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
I will have more than you can even dream of;
So enough for your amazement. But come on,
Contract us before these witnesses.

Shepherd:
Come, your hand;
And, my daughter, yours.

POLIXENES:
Gentle, my darling, one moment, I beg you;
Do you have a father?

FLORISEL:
I have: but what about him?

POLIXENES:
Does he know?

FLORISEL:
He doesn't and won't.

POLIXENES:
I think of a father
Is he a guest at his son's wedding
This makes the table better. I pray to you once again,
Hasn't your father become incapable
Reasonable deals? isn't he stupid
With age and altered colds? can he speak? hear?
Know man through man? contest your own inheritance?
He doesn't lie in bed? and again does nothing
But what did he do while being childish?

FLORISEL:
No, good sir;
He has his health and greater strength indeed
Than most of his age.

POLIXENES:
By my white beard,
You are offering him, if this is so, a wrong
Something unfaithful: reasons my son
Should choose a wife, but it's a good reason
The father, whose joy is nothing else
But fair posterity should have some advice
In such a company.

FLORISEL:
I yield all this;
But for other reasons, my serious sir,
What doesn't fit, you know, I don't know
My father from this company.

POLIXENES:
Let him know.

FLORISEL:
He won't do it.

POLIXENES:
Please leave him.

FLORISEL:
No, he shouldn't.

Shepherd:
Leave him alone, my son: he will not need to grieve
By knowing your choice.

FLORISEL:
Come, come, he must not.
Mark our contract.

POLIXENES:
Mark your divorce, young sir,
What son I dare not call; you are too low
To recognize: you are the heir to a scepter,
This therefore affects a sheep hook! You, old traitor,
I'm sorry that by hanging you I can
But shorten your life by a week. And you, fresh piece
Of excellent witchcraft, who by force must know
The royal fool you face,

Shepherd:
O my heart!

POLIXENES:
I will scrape your beauty with thorns and return it
Simpler than your condition. For you, my dear boy,
If I ever know, you just sigh
That you will never see this talent again, like never before
I mean, you will do it, we will prohibit you from succession;
I don't hold you back from our blood, no, not from our loved ones,
Far from Deucalion: mark my words:
Follow us to court. You are an idiot, this time,
Although full of our discontent, we release you
From the fatal blow. And you, enchantment.--
Quite worthy of a shepherd: yes, he too,
This is happening, but for our honor,
Unworthy of you, if ever from now on you
These rural latches at its entrance open,
Or surround his body more with your embraces,
I will imagine such a cruel death for you
How tender you are for that.

PERDITA:
Even here undone!
I wasn't very afraid; for once or twice
I was about to speak up and tell him clearly,
The same sun that shines on his yard
Don't hide his face from our cottage but
Looks the same. Would you not like to leave, sir?
I told you what would happen: I beg you,
Take care of your own state: my dream, -
Being now awake, I will rein him no further,
But treat my sheep and cry.

CAMILLO:
Well, how now, father!
Speak before you die.

Shepherd:
I can't speak or think
I don't dare know what I know either. O sir!
You destroyed a man of eighty-three,
This thought of filling his grave in silence, yeah,
To die on the bed, my father died,
To lie down by his honest bones: but now
An executioner must put on my shroud and put me to bed
Where no priest shovels dust. O cursed wretch,
Who knew it was the prince,
and would you like to have an adventure
To mix faith with him! Fact! fact!
If I could die in this hour, I lived
Die when I want.

FLORISEL:
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm sorry, I'm not afraid; delayed,
But nothing has changed: what I was, I am;
More effort to pluck, without following
My leash reluctantly.

CAMILLO:
Merciful my lord,
You know your father's character: at this moment
He won't allow any speeches, which I assume
You don't make a plan for him; and as if barely
Will he still bear your sight, I fear:
Then, until His Highness's fury subsides,
Don't come in front of him.

FLORISEL:
I didn't plan it.
I think, Camillo?

CAMILLO:
Even him, my lord.

PERDITA:
How many times have I told you that it would be like this!
How many times have I said, my dignity would last
But until we find out!

FLORISEL:
It can only fail by
The violation of my faith; and then
Let nature crush the sides of the earth together
And spoil the seeds inside! Lift your gaze:
Spare me from my inheritance, my father; I
Am the heir of my affection.

CAMILLO:
Be advised.

FLORISEL:
I am, and by my fantasy: if my reason
Will he be obedient there, I am right;
Otherwise, my senses, more satisfied with madness,
Welcome him.

CAMILLO:
It's desperate, sir.

FLORISEL:
So call him: but this fulfills my wish;
I have to think that's honest. Camille,
Not for Bohemia, nor for the splendor that can
Be gleaned from it, for all that the sun sees or
The nearby earthly bellies where the deep sea hides
Into unknown depths will I break my oath
To this, my beautiful beloved: therefore, I pray you,
As you have always been my father's honored friend,
When he misses me, - as, in faith, I don't want
To see it more, throw in your good tips
On his passion; leave me and fortune
Tow for the time to come. This you may know
And so book, I'm put overboard
With the one that I cannot keep here on earth;
And most expedient for our needs, I have
A ship passes quickly, but is not prepared
For this design. What course do I want to take
Nothing will benefit your knowledge, nor
Concern me about the report.

CAMILLO:
O my lord!
I wish your mind was easier to get advice,
Or stronger depending on your needs.

FLORISEL:
Listen, Perdita
I will hear from you soon.

CAMILLO:
It is immovable,
Solved for theft. Now was I happy, if
His departure, I could frame him to serve my turn,
Save him from danger, give him love and honor,
Buy again the view of dear Sicilia
And this unfortunate king, my master, whom
I'm so thirsty to see.

FLORISEL:
Now, good Camillo;
I am so loaded with curious affairs that
I leave aside the ceremony.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I think
You have heard of my poor services, I love it
That I gave birth to your father?

FLORISEL:
Very nobly
Did you deserve: it's my father's music
To say your deeds, not little of his care
Have them rewarded according to reflection.

CAMILLO:
Well, my lord,
If you can please think I love the king
And through him that which is nearest to him, that is to say
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
If your project is heavier and more regulated
May undergo alteration, on my honor,
I will tell you where you will have such a reception
As will suit your Highness; where you can
Take advantage of your mistress, from whom, I see,
There is no disjunction to be made, but by...
As heaven predicts! - your ruin; marry her,
And, despite all my efforts in your absence,
Your disgruntled father strives to qualify
And bring it to your liking.

FLORISEL:
How, Camillo,
Could this almost be a miracle?
So I can call you something more than man
And after that, trust yourself.

CAMILLO:
Have you thought about
A place where you will go?

FLORISEL:
Not yet :
But as the unthought accident is guilty
What we do wildly is what we profess
Ourselves to be slaves to chance and flies
Of every wind that blows.

CAMILLO:
So list me:
This follows, if you do not change your goal
But endure this flight, head towards Sicily,
And there, introduce yourself and your beautiful princess,
For this is what I see it must be, before Leontes:
It will be inhabited as it becomes
Your bed partner. It seems to me that I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His greeting; ask your son for forgiveness,
As if I were the father person; kiss hands
Of your new princess; o'er and o'er divides it
“Between his nastiness and his kindness; the one
He roars hell and asks the other to grow up
Faster than thought or time.

FLORISEL:
Worthy Camillo,
What color do I need for my visit
Hold on to him?

CAMILLO:
Sent by the king your father
To greet him and bring him comfort. Sir,
The way you behave towards him, with
What you will deliver from your father,
What we three know, I write to you:
The one that will tell you at each session
What you should say; that he will not perceive
But you have your father's breast there
And speak with all your heart.

FLORISEL:
I am attached to you:
There's sap in there.

CAMILLO:
A more promising cause
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
Towards unknown waters, unimaginable shores, very certain
Enough misery; no hope of helping you,
But as you get rid of one and take another;
Nothing is more certain than your anchors, which
Do their best, if they can, but stay you
Where you'll hate to be: besides you know
Prosperity is the very bond of love,
Whose complexion is fresh and whose heart is together
The affliction changes.

PERDITA:
One of these statements is true:
I think affliction can master the cheek,
But don't become aware.

CAMILLO:
Yeah, you say so?
There will be no such things at your father's house
seven years
To be born another such.

FLORISEL:
My good Camillo,
She is as far ahead of her breeding as
It is behind our birth.

CAMILLO:
I can't say it's a shame
She lacks instructions, as she seems to be a mistress
To most who teach.

PERDITA:
Your pardon, sir; for that
I will blush you thank you.

FLORISEL:
My prettiest Perdita!
But oh, the thorns on which we stand! Camille,
Preserver of my father, now of me,
The medicine of our house, how are we going to do it?
We are not furnished like the son of Bohemia,
He will not appear in Sicily either.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Don't be afraid of any of this: I think you know my destiny
Stay all there: so will my care
For naming you royally as if
The scene you played was mine. For example, sir,
Just so you know you won't miss a word.

AUTOLYCUS:
Ha, ha! How stupid is honesty! and Trust, its
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I sold
all my tricks; not a counterfeit stone, not a
ribbon, glass, pommel, brooch, table book, ballad,
knife, duct tape, glove, shoe tie, bracelet, horn ring,
to prevent my pack from fasting: they hurry who
I should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
sanctified and brought a blessing to the buyer:
how I saw which handbag was the best
picture; and what I saw, for my benefit, I
recalled. My clown, who only wants something
being a reasonable man, became so in love with
girls' song, so that he doesn't move his feet
until he has both the air and the words; which thus attracted the
rest of the herd for me than all their other senses
stuck in the ears: you may have pinched a paw, that
was foolish; it was nothing gelding a fly of a
sotck exchange; I could have put away the hanging keys
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my gentleman's song,
and admiring nothing. So that in this
period of lethargy, I picked and cut most of their
handbags for festivals; and if the old man hadn't come in
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king
son and I scared my crave of the ball, I didn't have
left a living purse throughout the army.

CAMILLO:
No, but my letters, being there by this means
As soon as you arrive, you will dispel this doubt.

FLORISEL:
And those that you will procure for King Leontes...

CAMILLO:
I will satisfy your father.

PERDITA:
Happy are you!
Everything you say is right.

CAMILLO:
Who do we have here?
We will make it an instrument, omit
Nothing can help us.

AUTOLYCUS:
If they heard me now, well, hanged.

CAMILLO:
Well, my good man! why are you trembling like this? Fear
no, man; there is no harm to be done to you.

AUTOLYCUS:
I'm a poor boy, sir.

CAMILLO:
Well, stay so quiet; that's it, no one will steal this
you: yet, for the exterior of your poverty, we must
make an exchange ; therefore I dispel you instantly,
--you must think that there is a necessity in this,--and
change clothes with this gentleman: although the
Pennyworth for his part, be the worst, but hold on,
there is a start.

AUTOLYCUS:
I'm a poor boy, sir.
I know you quite well.

CAMILLO:
No, please hurry: the gentleman is half
already skinned.

AUTOLYCUS:
Are you serious, sir?
I smell the thing.

FLORISEL:
Please hurry up.

AUTOLYCUS:
Indeed, I had money; but I can't with
conscience, take it.

CAMILLO:
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
Happy mistress, let my prophecy
Go home ! - you must withdraw
In a hiding place: take your darling's hat
And tear it off your eyebrows, smother your face,
Dismantle yourself and, as much as you can, hate
The truth of your own appearance; so that you can...
Because I'm afraid of my eyes - on board the ship
Be discreet.

PERDITA:
I see the room so clearly
That I have to bear part of it.

CAMILLO:
No cure.
Did you do it there?

FLORISEL:
Should I now meet my father,
He wouldn't call me son.

CAMILLO:
No, you won't have a hat.
Come, madam, come. Goodbye My friend.

AUTOLYCUS:
Farewell, sir.

FLORISEL:
O Perdita, what have we both forgotten!
Please, a word.

CAMILLO:

FLORISEL:
Fortune accelerates us!
So we set off, Camillo, towards the seaside.

CAMILLO:
The faster the speed, the better.

AUTOLYCUS:
I understand the job, I hear it: having a
an open ear, a lively eye and a nimble hand is
necessary for a cut purse; a good nose is required
also, feel the work of the other senses. I see
this is the time when the unrighteous man prospers.
What an exchange it had been without a start! What
a boot is here with this exchange! Of course the gods do
this year, collude with us, and we can do anything
improvised. The prince himself speaks of a piece of
iniquity, robbing his father with his
hoof at his heels: if I thought it was a piece of
honesty to inform the king, I would not want
don't do it: I find it all the more deceitful because I hide it;
and in this I am faithful to my profession.
Apart, apart; here is more material for a burning brain:
every end of alley, every store, church, session,
suspended, gives neat work.

Clown:
See see; what a man you are now!
There is no other way than to tell the king
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.

Shepherd:
No, but listen to me.

Clown:
No, but listen to me.

Shepherd:
Go ahead, then.

Clown:
She is neither of your flesh nor of your blood, your flesh
and blood did not offend the king; and therefore your
flesh and blood must not be punished by him. To show
these things you found about her, these secrets
things, everything except what she has with her: that being said
fact, let the law whistle: I guarantee it to you.

Shepherd:
I will tell the king everything, every word, yes, and its
my son's pranks too; who, I can say, is not an honest man,
neither to his father nor to me, to go and do
me, the king's brother-in-law.

Clown:
Indeed, the brother-in-law was the furthest from you
could have been for him and then your blood would have been
the most expensive, I know how much an ounce.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
Well, let's talk about the king: there's that in this
Fardel is going to make him scratch his beard.

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Pray wholeheartedly that he will be at the palace.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
At the palace, it's like your worship.

AUTOLYCUS:
Your business there, what, with whom, the state
of this fardel, the place of your residence, your
names, your age, what do you have, breeding and all
something that should be known and discovered.

Clown:
We are just comrades, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
A lie; you are hard and hairy. Do not leave me
lie: it becomes only traders, and they
often make us soldiers lie: but we pay them for
it has a stamped coin, not stabbed steel; SO
they don't lie to us.

Clown:
Your Honor would have liked to give us one, if you
didn't get used to it.

Shepherd:
Are you a courtier, and not like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Whether I like it or not, I am a courtier. See
don't you look like the court in these enclosures?
Is not my approach the measure of the court?
don't you get your courtly scent from me? I'm thinking
not about your baseness, your contempt of court? Do you think,
for this I insinuate, or I distance you from you your
business, so I'm not a courtier? I am a courtier
cap-a-pe; and he who will push or pull
return your things there: whereupon I order you to
open your business.

Shepherd:
My business, sir, concerns the king.

AUTOLYCUS:
What lawyer do you have for him?

Shepherd:
I don't know, it's not like you.

Clown:
Avocado is the court word for a pheasant: you say
have none.

Shepherd:
None, sir; I have no pheasant, rooster or hen.

AUTOLYCUS:
How blessed are we who are not simple men!
Yet nature could have made me as they are,
Therefore I will not disdain.

Clown:
He can only be a great courtier.

Shepherd:
His clothes are rich, but he wears
them not generously.

Clown:
It seems to be all the more noble because it is fantastic:
a great man, I guarantee it; I know by picking
on the teeth.

AUTOLYCUS:
The fardel there? what is fardel?
Why this box?

Shepherd:
Sir, there are such secrets in this fardel and this box,
which no one should know except the king; and that he
I will know in this hour if I can come to
speech by him.

AUTOLYCUS:
Age, you lost your job.

Shepherd:
Why sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
The king is not at the palace; he left on board a
new vessel to purge melancholy and get some fresh air: because,
if you are capable of serious things, you must
I know the king is full of sorrow.

Shepard:
So it is said, sir; about his son, it should have
married a shepherd's daughter.

AUTOLYCUS:
If this shepherd is not in full possession of his means, let him flee:
the curses he will have, the tortures he will have
feel, will break the back of man, the heart of the monster.

Clown:
Do you think so, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
He will not be the only one to suffer from what the mind can make heavy
and revenge is bitter; but those which concern
he, although he is taken away fifty times, will all come
under the executioner: which, although it is a great pity,
yet it is necessary. An old thug who whistles sheep
tender ram, to offer to bring his daughter
Grace! Some say he will be stoned; but this death
is too soft for him, let's say I pull our throne into a
sheepfold! all the deaths are too few, the most serious too easy.

Clown:
Did the old man ever have a son, sir, do you hear. ant
like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
He has a son who will be flayed alive; SO
'anointed with honey, placed on the head of a
wasp's nest; then stays standing until it is three-quarters full
and a dead drama; then recovered again with
aqua-vitae or other hot infusion; then, believed as
it is, and in the prognosis of the hottest days
proclaims, will be placed against a brick wall, the
sun looking at it with one eye towards the south, where it
it's seeing him with flies blown to death. But what
are we talking about these rascally traitors, whose miseries
are worthy of smiling, their offenses being so
capital? Tell me, because you seem to be honest and clear
men, what you have to the king: to be something
gently thought, I will take you where it is
on board, submit your people to his presence,
whisper it in your favor; and if it is in humans
apart from the king to perform your suits, here is the man
I will do it.

Clown:
He seems to hold great authority: close to him,
give him gold; and although the authority is stubborn
bear, yet he is often led by the nose with gold: show
the inside of your purse to the outside of her hand,
and no more noise. Remember “stoned” and “flayed alive”.

Shepherd:
It will not please you, sir, to undertake the matter for
us, here is this gold that I have: I will do the same
more and leave this young man as a pledge until I bring him to you.

AUTOLYCUS:
After doing what I promised?

Shepherd:
Yes sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, give me half. Are you involved in this business?

Clown:
In a way, sir: but although my case is pitiful
one, I hope I won't be scratched by it.

AUTOLYCUS:
Oh, so is the shepherd's son: hang him,
he will be an example.

Clown:
Comfort, good comfort! We owe it to the king and show
our strange views: he must know that it is not your
my daughter nor my sister; we went elsewhere. Sir, I
will give you as much as this old man when the
the business is done and remains, as he says, your
pawn until it is brought to you.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will trust you. Walk forward towards the seaside;
go to the right: I will only look at the
cover yourself and follow yourself.

Clown:
We are happy in this man, if I may say so, even happy.

Shepherd:
Let us do first as he asks us: it was intended to do us good.

AUTOLYCUS:
If I meant to be honest, I see Fortune would
Don't suffer me: she drops slippers in my mouth. I am
wooed now with double opportunity, gold and means
do good to the prince my master; who knows how
Could this harm my advancement? I will bring
these two moles, these blind men, on board: if he
thinks that it is appropriate to substantiate them again and that the
the complaint they have with the king concerns him
nothing, let him call me a thug because I'm so far away
unofficial; because I am proof of this title and
what shame else does not belong. I will introduce him
them: there may be matter in it.

CLEOMENE:
Sir, you've done enough and played
A saint's sorrow: you could make no mistake,
Which you have not redeemed; indeed, paid
More penance than offense: in the end,
Do as the heavens do, forget your evil;
With them, forgive yourself.

LEONTES:
While I remember
She and her virtues, I cannot forget her
My imperfections are there, and I always think about them
The evil that I have done myself; which was so,
This made my kingdom heirless and
I destroyed the sweetest companion of all men
He got his hopes out.

PAULINE:
It's true, it's too true, my lord:
If, one by one, you married everyone,
Or from whatever is taken something good,
To make a perfect woman, you killed her
This would be unprecedented.

LEONTES:
I think so. Kill !
I killed her! I did it: but you hit me
Sadly, to say I did; it's also bitter
On your tongue as in my thoughts: now, well now,
Say it but rarely.

CLEOMENE:
Not at all, good lady:
You could have said a thousand things that
I made time more beneficial and honored
Your kindness is better.

PAULINE:
You are one of those
I would like him to remarry.

DION:
If you don't,
You have no pity on the State or on memory
From its most sovereign name; consider little
What dangers, due to the failure of His Highness's broadcast,
May fall upon his kingdom and devour
Uncertain spectators. What's more holy
How can we be happy that the former queen is doing well?
What could be more sacred than, for the repair of royalty,
For present comfort and for future good,
To bless the bed of majesty again
With a nice boy?

PAULINE:
There is none worthy,
Respecting her, here we go. In addition, the gods
Will have fulfilled their secret designs;
For did not the divine Apollo say:
Is this not the content of his oracle,
That King Leontes will have no heir
Until her lost child is found? what he owes,
All this is also monstrous for our human reason
Like my Antigone to break her grave
And come back to me; who, over my life,
Died with the child. This is your advice
My lord should be contrary to heaven,
Oppose against their will.
Don't worry about the problem;
The crown will find an heir: the great Alexander
He left his to the most worthy; therefore his successor
It was like being the best.

LEONTES:
Good Pauline,
Who remembers Hermione,
I know, with honor, oh, that never I
Submitted me to your advice! so, even now,
I could have looked at my queen with full eyes,
I took a treasure from her lips...

PAULINE:
And I left them
Richer for what they brought back.

LEONTES:
You're saying the truth.
No more such wives; therefore no woman: a worse one,
And used better, it would make his mind a saint
Possess his corpse again, and on this scene,
Where we are delinquents now, seem vexed,
And start: “Why for me? »

PAULINE:
Did she have such power,
She had a just cause.

LEONTES:
She had; and would irritate me
To murder him, I got married.

PAULINE:
I should do it.
If I were the walking ghost, I'd ask you to score
His eye, and tell me what boring part it's not for
You chose it; then I would scream, that even your ears
I would have to tear myself apart to hear myself; and the words that followed
It should be “Remember Mine.”

LEONTES:
Stars, stars,
And all the other eyes are dead coals! Fear nothing, woman;
I won't have a wife, Paulina.

PAULINE:
Will you swear
Never get married without my free leave?

LEONTES:
Never, Paulina; so bless my spirit!

PAULINE:
So, my good lords, bear witness to his oath.

CLEOMENE:
You're trying too hard.

PAULINE:
Unless another,
As similar to Hermione as her picture,
Meet his eyes.

CLEOMENE:
Good madam,--

PAULINE:
I did.
However, if my lord wants to marry, if you want it, sir,
No cure, but you will, give me the office
To choose a queen for you: she won't be so young
Just like your old one; but it will be like this
As I walked with the ghost of your first queen,
it should be a joy
To see her in your arms.

LEONTES:
My real Paulina,
We won't get married until you ask us to.

PAULINE:
That
It will be when your first queen catches her breath;
Never until then.

Gentleman:
He who gives himself up to Prince Florizel,
Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
The most beautiful I have ever seen wants access
To your high presence.

LEONTES:
And him ? he is not coming
Like the greatness of his father: his approach,
So irrelevant and sudden, tells us
This is not a supervised visit, but a forced one
By necessity and by accident. Which train?

Gentleman:
But few,
And these, but nasty.

LEONTES:
His princess, you say, with him?

Gentleman:
Yes, the most incomparable piece of land, I think,
It was always the sun that shone.

PAULINE:
Oh Hermione,
As every present time boasts
Above a better party, your grave too
Leave room for what is seen now! Sir, yourself
I said it and wrote it, but you write it now
Is colder than this theme, "She had not been,
Nor was it necessary to be equaled; - thus your verse
Flowed with her beauty once: she flowed back artfully,
Say you've seen better.

Gentleman:
Excuse me ma'am :
The one I almost forgot, sorry,
The other, when she has obtained your eye,
Will also have your tongue. It's a creature,
Would she like to found a sect, could she extinguish the zeal
Of all the other teachers, make proselytes
From whom she only suggests following.

PAULINE:
How! not women?

Gentleman:
Women will love her, she's a woman
More valuable than any man; men, that she is
The rarest of all women.

LEONTES:
Come on, Cleomenes;
You yourself, assisted by your honorable friends,
Bring them into our embrace. Yet it's strange
So he should steal from us.

PAULINE:
Our prince had
Jewel of children, seen at this hour, he had mated
Well with this lord: there hasn't been a full month
Between their births.

LEONTES:
Please, no more; cease; You know
It still kills me when we talk about it: of course,
When I see this gentleman, your speeches
Will lead me to consider what could
Rid me of reason. They came.
Your mother was very faithful to marriage, prince;
For she imprinted your royal father,
To conceive of you: if I were twenty-one years old,
The image of your father is so striking in you,
His very look, that I should call you brother,
Like I did, and I'm talking wildly about something
By us, we have already done it. Best regards !
And your beautiful princess, goddess! oh, alas!
I lost some, between heaven and earth
He could thus have produced wonders while
You, gracious couple, do it: and then I lost...
All my own madness - society,
Friendship also from your brave father, who,
Although I bear misery, I desire my life
Once again to watch it.

FLORISEL:
By his command
Have I here touched Sicilia and from him
I give you all the greetings that a king, a friend,
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
Who waits for worn times for something to be seized
His desired ability, he had it himself
The lands and waters between your throne and his
Measured to look at you; that he likes...
He told me to say it, more than all the scepters
And those who carry them alive.

LEONTES:
O my brother,
Good sir! the wrongs I did to you stir
Again in me, and these your offices,
So rarely kind, we are performers
Of my laziness behind my hand. Welcome here,
Just like spring on earth. And him too
Exposed this model to frightening use,
At least rude, from the formidable Neptune,
To greet a man who is not worth it, let alone
The adventure of his person?

FLORISEL:
Good my lord,
She came from Libya.

LEONTES:
Where the warrior Smalus,
Is this noble and honored lord feared and loved?

FLORISEL:
Very royal sir, hence; of him, whose daughter
His tears proclaimed hers, separating from her: from there,
A prosperous and friendly south wind we passed through,
To carry out the charge my father gave me
To visit Your Highness: my best train
I have been sent back from your Sicilian shores;
Who for Bohemia bends, to signify
Not only my success in Libya, sir,
But my arrival and my wife are safe
Here where we are.

LEONTES:
The blessed gods
Purge any infection from our air while you
Make the climate here! You have a holy father,
A gracious gentleman; against whose person,
As sacred as it is, I have committed the sin:
Which the heavens, angrily taking note of,
Left me without problem; and your father is blessed,
As he deserves it from heaven, with you
Worthy of his goodness. What could I have been,
May I, a son and a daughter, look upon them now,
Such beautiful things as you!

Lord:
Very noble sir,
What I report will carry no credit,
Wasn't the proof so close. Please, great sir,
Bohemia greets you on its behalf through me;
Wants you to tie up his son, who has...
Both his dignity and his duty have been abandoned...
Running away from his father, his hopes and with
A shepherd's daughter.

LEONTES:
Where is Bohemia? talk.

Lord:
Here in your city; I now come from him:
I speak with astonishment; and it becomes
My wonder and my message. At your court
As he hurried on, seemingly in pursuit,
Of this beautiful couple, he meets him on the way
The father of this apparent lady and
His brother, having both left their country
With this young prince.

FLORISEL:
Camillo betrayed me;
Whose honor and honesty so far
Endured all the weather.

Lord:
Put him in charge:
He is with the king your father.

LEONTES:
WHO? Camille?

Lord:
Camillo, sir; I talked to him; who now
Are these poor men in question? I've never seen
The wretched thus tremble: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
Refrain as often as they speak:
Bohemia covers their ears and threatens them
With various deaths within death.

PERDITA:
O my poor father!
The sky is spying on us, it won't have it
Our contract celebrated.

LEONTES:
You are married?

FLORISEL:
We are not, sir, and we do not intend to be;
The stars, I see, will first embrace the valleys:
The probabilities are the same for highs and lows.

LEONTES:
My lord,
Is she the daughter of a king?

FLORISEL:
She is,
When once, she is my wife.

LEONTES:
This "once" I see it at the speed of your good father
It will come very slowly. I'm sorry,
Sorry you broke up with his taste
Where you were bound by duty, and as sorry
Your choice is not as rich in value as beauty,
So that you can appreciate it well.

FLORISEL:
Dear, looking for:
Even if Fortune, visible enemy,
I should chase me and my father away, power is useless
Will it change our loves? I beg you, sir,
Remember since you no longer owed anything to time
That I do now: thinking of such affections,
Move forward, defender of the mines; to your request
My father will grant precious things like trifles.

LEONTES:
Would he do so, I would pray to your precious mistress,
Which only counts as a trifle.

PAULINE:
Sir, my lord,
Your eye is too young: not a month
"Before your queen died, she deserved such looks more
Than what you are looking at now.

LEONTES:
I thought of her,
Even in these looks that I did.
But your petition
Is still unanswered. I will tell your father:
Your honor is not overthrown by your desires,
I am friends with them and with you: on what mission
I am now going to him; so follow me
And notice the path I take: come, my good lord.

AUTOLYCUS:
I beg you, sir, were you present at this relationship?

First Sir:
I was there at the opening of the fardel, I heard the old man
the shepherd delivers the way he found it:
whereupon, after a little astonishment, we were all
ordered out of the room; only that's what i thought
heard the shepherd say, he has found the child.

AUTOLYCUS:
I would be very happy to know the outcome.

First Sir:
I make a broken delivery of the case; but the
the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
very notes of admiration: they almost seemed, with
staring at each other, to tear up their belongings
eyes; there was speech in their silence, language
in their very gesture; they looked as they heard
of a world redeemed, or destroyed: a notable
the passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
the spectator, who knew nothing other than to see, could not
say whether the significance was joy or sorrow; but in the
end of it, it is necessary.
Here is a gentleman who perhaps knows more.
Any news, Rogero?

Second gentleman:
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; THE
the king's daughter is found: so much wonder is
broke out in this hour that the makers of ballads
can't express it.
Here comes Lady Paulina's steward: he can
deliver more to you. How are you now, sir? this new
what we call true resembles an old tale so much that
the truth is strongly suspected: did the king
found his heir?

Third gentleman:
Very true, if ever the truth was pregnant with
circumstance: what you hear, you will swear to yourself
see, there is such unity in the evidence. The coat
of Queen Hermione, her jewel around her neck,
Antigone's letters found with him and that they
know how to be one's character, the majesty of
mother-like creature, affection
of nobility that nature shows above its breeding,
and many other proofs proclaim it with all
certainty of being the king's daughter. Have you seen
the meeting of the two kings?

Second gentleman:
No.

Third gentleman:
So have you lost a sight that needed to be seen,
we can't talk about it. There, you may have seen one
joy crowns another, in such and such a way that it
it seemed that sorrow was crying to take leave of them, for their
joy waded into tears. There were raised eyes,
raising their hands, with faces like
distraction that they were to be known by their clothing,
not as a favor. Our king, ready to come out
himself for the joy of his found daughter, as if that
joy had now become loss, cry "O your mother,
your mother ! then asks for forgiveness from Bohemia; SO
kisses his son-in-law; again, he worries about himself
girl cutting it; now he thanks the old man
shepherd, who stands there like one bitten by the weather
led many reigns of kings. I have never heard of such
another meeting, which blades report to follow it
and undoes the description to do so.

Second gentleman:
What has become, please, of Antigone, who wore
where is the child from?

Third gentleman:
Like an old tale again, which will be important to
repeat, even if you have to be asleep and not one ear
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
declares the shepherd's son; who not only has his own
innocence, which seems a lot, to justify it, but a
her handkerchief and her rings that Paulina knows.

First Sir:
What happened to his bark and his followers?

Third gentleman:
Destroyed at the same moment of the death of their master and
in the eyes of the shepherd: so that all
the instruments which contributed to exposing the child were
even then lost when it was found. But oh the noble
battle in which joy and sorrow took place
Pauline! She had one eye refused due to the loss of
her husband, another raised that the oracle was
accomplished: she lifted the princess from the ground,
and thus encloses him in her arms, as if she wanted to pin him
hold her close to her heart so that she is no longer in danger
to lose.

First Sir:
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes; for that is how it was done.

Third gentleman:
One of the prettiest touches of all and the one that
tilted for my eyes, I caught the water but not
the fish, when was it, to the queen's relationship
death, with the way she courageously achieved it
confessed and deplored by the king, how
the attention hurt his daughter; until, from a
sign of pain towards another, she did so, with an “Alas!”
I would gladly say, bleed tears, because I'm sure my
the heart cried blood. Who was more marble there has changed
color; some fainted, all were sad: if everyone
I could have seen it, the misfortune had been universal.

First Sir:
Are they sent to court?

Third gentleman:
No: the princess hearing about her mother's statue,
which is in Paulina's custody, a piece that many
years of work and now newly performed by this rare
Italian master, Julio Romano, who himself had
eternity and could breathe life into his work,
deceive the nature of his custom, so perfectly he is she
monkey: he is so close to Hermione that he made Hermione
they say we would talk to him and hope
answer: there with all the eagerness of affection
have they gone, and there they plan to have supper.

Second gentleman:
I thought she had a big deal in hand there;
because she has in private two or three times a day, always
since Hermione's death, visited who removed
House. Should we go and with our company piece
rejoicing?

First Sir:
Who would then benefit from access?
with each wink of an eye, a new grace will be born:
our absence makes us uneconomical as far as we know.
Let's go.

AUTOLYCUS:
Now, if I didn't have the drive of my old life in me,
Would the preference fall on my head? I brought the old
man and his son on board the prince: I told him that I had heard
they talk about a fardel and I don't know what: but he
at that time, too fond of the shepherd's daughter,
so he then took her to be, which began to be a lot
sea-sick, and himself hardly better, extremity of
time continued, this mystery remained
undiscovered. But to me, everything is one; because if I had
been the discoverer of this secret, it would not be
I savored among my other discredits.
Here come those to whom I have done good against my will,
and already appearing in the flowers of their fortune.

Shepherd:
Come, my boy; I am beyond my children, but your sons and
the girls will all be born as gentlemen.

Clown:
You are well received, sir. You refused to fight with me
the other day, because I wasn't born a gentleman.
Do you see these clothes? say you don't see them and
I think I'm still not a born gentleman: you better say
these dresses were not born to be gentlemen: give me the
lie, do and try if I am not now a born gentleman.

AUTOLYCUS:
I know that you are now, sir, a born gentleman.

Clown:
Yes, and that was the case at all times during these four hours.

Shepherd:
And me too, my boy.

Clown:
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
called me brother; and then the two kings called my
father brother; and then the prince my brother and
the princess that my sister called my father father; And
then we cried, and there was the first gentleman
the tears we have always shed.

Shepherd:
We could live, my son, to lose many more.

Clown:
Yes ; or else it was bad luck to be like that
absurd domain like us.

AUTOLYCUS:
I humbly beg you, sir, to forgive me everything
faults that I have committed to your worship and to give
me your good report to the prince my master.

Shepherd:
Please, my son, do it; for we must be gentle, now we are
Gentlemen.

Clown:
Do you want to change your life?

AUTOLYCUS:
Yes, it's like your good worship.

Clown:
Give me your hand: I will swear before the prince that you
I am an honest man as honest as any other in Bohemia.

Shepherd:
You can say it, but not swear to it.

Clown:
I don't swear, now I'm a gentleman? Leave the boors and
Franklin says it, I swear.

Shepherd:
What if it wasn't true, my son?

Clown:
If it's never so wrong, a true gentleman can swear
in the name of his friend: and I will swear to
the prince, you are a great man with your hands and
that you will not be drunk; but I know you're not
great man of your hands and that you will be
drunk: but I swear, and I will, you would like
be a great man with your hands.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will prove it, sir, to the best of my ability.

Clown:
Yes, prove by all means that you are a big boy: if I don't
I wonder how you dare venture to be drunk, not
being a tall man, don't believe me. Listen ! the Kings
and the princes, our brothers, go to see the
photo of the queen. Come, follow us: we will be yours
good masters.

LEONTES:
O serious and good Paulina, the great comfort
That I got from you!

PAULINE:
What, sovereign sir,
I didn't do well, I wanted to. All my services
You paid for your house: but you stood surety,
With your crowned brother and these, you are under contract
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
It is a surplus of your grace, which has never
My life may last to answer.

LEONTES:
O Pauline,
We honor you with trouble: but we came
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
Have we been there, not without a lot of content
In many singularities; but we didn't see
What my daughter came to see,
The statue of his mother.

PAULINE:
As she lived without equal,
So his dead resemblance, I believe,
Excels in everything you look at
Or the hand of man has made; so I keep it
Alone, separated. But here it is: prepare yourself
To see life as alive and mocked as ever
Sleep always mocking death: behold, and say that all is well.
I like your silence, it shows off even more
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
Isn't that something close?

LEONTES:
His natural posture!
Reprimand me, dear stone, that I may indeed say
You are Hermione; or rather, you are her
In your non-reprimand, for it was also tender
Like childhood and grace. But nevertheless, Paulina,
Hermione wasn't that wrinkled, nothing
As old as it sounds.

POLIXENES:
Oh, not much.

PAULINE:
All the more the excellence of our sculptor;
Which lets sixteen years pass and makes her
As she lived now.

LEONTES:
As she could have done now,
So much for my comfort, as it is
Now piercing my soul. Oh, so she stood,
Even with such a life of majesty, a warm life,
As he is today, when I first courted him!
I am ashamed: does not the stone reprimand me
To be more stone than her? O royal piece,
There is magic in your majesty, which has
My pains evoked in memory and
From your admiring daughter have taken the spirits,
Standing like a stone with you.

PERDITA:
And give me leave,
And don't say it's superstition, that
I kneel down and pray for his blessing. Lady,
Dear queen, it ended when I began,
Give me your hand to kiss.

PAULINE:
O patience!
The statue is only newly repaired, the color is not dry.

CAMILLO:
My lord, your grief was too painful,
That sixteen winters cannot take away,
So many dry summers; almost no joy
I lived a very long time; no sorrow
But he committed suicide much earlier.

POLIXENES:
Dear my brother,
May he who is the cause have the power
To take away as much sorrow from you as he
Will reconstitute itself.

PAULINE:
Indeed, my lord,
If I had thought of the sight of my poor image
I would have done so to you, for the stone is mine.
I wouldn't have shown it.

LEONTES:
Don't pull the curtain.

PAULINE:
You will not look at it again, lest your fancy
Maybe it will move right away.

LEONTES:
Let it be, let it be.
Would I have been dead, but that, I think, already...
What did he do ? See, my lord,
Wouldn't you believe he breathes? and that these veins
Did he really carry blood?

POLIXENES:
Expertly done:
Life itself seems hot on his lips.

LEONTES:
The fixation of his eye has no movement,
How they make fun of us with art.

PAULINE:
I'm going to pull back the curtain:
Monsignor is almost so transported that
He will soon think he is alive.

LEONTES:
O sweet Pauline,
Make me think so, twenty years together!
No established sense of the world can match
The pleasure of this madness. Don't leave us alone.

PAULINE:
I am sorry, sir, I have stirred you up until now: but
I could distress you more.

LEONTES:
Do it, Pauline;
For this affliction tastes so sweet
Like any cordial comfort. However, I think,
There is an air that comes from her: what a beautiful scissor
Could it ever take your breath away again? Let no one make fun of me,
Because I'm going to kiss him.

PAULINE:
Well my lord, refrain:
The reddish color of her lip is moist;
You'll spoil it if you kiss it, stain yours
With oil paint. Should I pull back the curtain?

LEONTES:
No, not these twenty years.

PERDITA:
I could so long
Wait, a spectator.

PAULINE:
Either abstain,
Leave the chapel immediately, or resolve
For more astonishment. If you can see it,
I'm actually going to make the statue move, come down
And I take you by the hand; but then you will think...
Against which I protest - I am helped
By wicked powers.

LEONTES:
What you can make him do,
I just watch: what can I say,
I'm glad to hear; because it's that simple
Make her talk and move.

PAULINE:
It is required
You awaken your faith. Then everyone remains motionless;
About: those who think this is an illegal activity
I'm about to let them go.

LEONTES:
Proceed:
No foot will move.

PAULINE:
Music, wake her up; strike!
It's time ; to come down; be no longer stone; approach;
Strike with wonder all that looks. Come,
I will fill your grave: move, no, come,
Bequeath to death your numbness, because from him
Dear life, you redeem yourself. You see that she is moving:
Don't start; his actions will be holy as
You hear that my fate is legal: don't run away from it
Until you see her die again; for then
You double kill her. No, present your hand:
When she was young, you courted her; now of age
Has she become the contender?

LEONTES:
Oh, she's hot!
If it's magic, let it be art
Legal as eating.

POLIXENES:
She kisses him.

CAMILLO:
It hangs around his neck:
If it belongs to life, let it speak too.

POLIXENES:
Yes, and don't show where she lived,
Or how to steal from the dead.

PAULINE:
That she lives,
If this was said to you it should be booed
Like an old tale: but it seems that she lives,
But she doesn't speak yet. Take a moment.
Please intervene, beautiful lady: kneel
And pray for your mother's blessing. Turn around, good lady;
Our Perdita is found.

HERMIONE:
Gods, look down
And from your sacred cups pour out your graces
On my daughter's head! Tell me, mine.
Where have you been preserved? where did he live ? how to find
Your father's court? because you will hear that I,
Knowing from Paulina that the oracle
I gave the hope that you were, I preserved
Myself to see the problem.

PAULINE:
We have enough time for this;
Lest they desire trouble from this push
Your joys with as a relationship. Go together,
All of you, precious winners; your exultation
Everyone participate. Me, an old turtle,
Will fly me to a withered branch and there
My friend, we'll never find him again,
Lament until I am lost.

LEONTES:
O peace, Paulina!
You should take a husband with my consent,
As I am with your wife: it's a match,
And made between wishes. You found mine;
But how should we ask? because I saw her,
As I thought, dead, and I said much in vain
A prayer at his grave. I won't look far...
For him I know part of his mind - to find you
An honorable husband. Come, Camillo,
And take her by the hand, whose value and honesty
Is richly noted and here justified
By us, a pair of kings. Let's leave this place.
What! look at my brother: your two pardons,
This is always what I put between your sacred gazes
My bad suspicions. He's your son-in-law,
And son of the king who, under the guidance of heaven,
It's a misfortune for your daughter. Good Pauline,
Lead us from here, where we can quietly
Everyone demands an answer for their part
Performed in this wide time interval since the first time
We have been separated: take us away with all haste.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Escalus.

ESCALUS:
My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
From the government the properties to be deployed,
This would seem to me to affect speech and discourse;
Since I know that your own science
In this way, it goes beyond the lists of all the councils
My strength can give you: then there is nothing left,
But to your sufficiency, according to your worth,
And let them work. The nature of our people,
The institutions of our city and the modalities
For common justice, you are also pregnant
As art and practice have enriched everything
What we remember. There is our commission,
Hence we would not want you to distort yourself. Call here,
I say, offer to come before us Angelo.
What figure of us do you think he will portray?
Because you have to know, we have a special soul
I elected our absence to refuel,
We lent him our terror, we dressed him with our love,
And given his delegation, all the organs
About our own power: what do you think?

ESCALUS:
If there is anything in Vienna that is worth it
To undergo such grace and honor,
It's Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Look where it comes from.

ANGELO:
Always obedient to the will of your grace,
I have just heard of your pleasure.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Angelo,
There is some kind of character in your life,
It is up to the observer that your story
Unfold completely. You and your possessions
Are yours not fit enough to waste them?
You yourself on your virtues, them on you.
The sky does with us what we do with torches,
Don't light them for their own sake; because if our virtues
I didn't come out of us, they were all the same
As if we didn't have them. Spirits are not finely touched
But to beautiful things, neither nature ever lends
The slightest scruple of his excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she decides
Itself the glory of a creditor,
Thanks and use. But I bend my speech
To him who can announce my role in him;
So wait, Angelo:
In our retreat, be fully yourself;
Mortality and Mercy in Vienna
Live in your tongue and in your heart: old Escalus,
Although the first question is your secondary.
Take your commission.

ANGELO:
Now, good my lord,
Let there be one more test of my metal,
Before such a noble and great figure
Get stamped on it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No more escape:
We have with a choice of sourdough and prepared
I have proceeded to you; so take your honours.
Our hurry from here is in such a rapid state
That he prefers himself and leaves indisputable
Questions of necessary value. We will write to you,
While time and our concerns will bother us,
How is it going with us, and try to find out
What's happening to you here? Then good luck ;
To the hopeful execution I leave you
Of your commissions.

ANGELO:
But give your leave, my lord,
So that we can bring you something along the way.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My haste will perhaps not admit it;
Nor do you need, on my honor, to do
With no qualms; your field of action is the same as mine
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As for your soul, it seems good. Give me your hand:
I will leave in secret. I like people,
But I don't like putting myself on display in their eyes:
Thanks to that, I do good, I don't appreciate it well
Their loud applause and their vehement Aves;
Nor do I think that the man of sure discretion
It affects him. Once again, good luck to you.

ANGELO:
The heavens give security to your goals!

ESCALUS:
Move forward and bring yourself back to happiness!

DUKE:
I thank you. Be well.

ESCALUS:
I will ask you, sir, to give me permission
Have freedom of expression with you; and it concerns me
To look inside my house:
A power that I have, but of what strength and what nature
I am not yet educated.

ANGELO:
This is how it is for me. Let's retire together,
And we could soon have our satisfaction
Touch this point.

ESCALUS:
I will wait for your honor.

LUCIO:
If the Duke and the other Dukes do not come
composition with the king of Hungary, why then everything
the dukes fall on the king.

First Sir:
Heaven grants us peace, but not the king of
That of Hungary!

Second gentleman:
Amen.

LUCIO:
You conclude, like the moralizing pirate, that
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
one off the table.

Second gentleman:
'Thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO:
Yes, that he shaved.

First Sir:
Well, it was a command to command the captain and
all the rest of their functions: they highlight
fly. There is not a single soldier among us who, in
thanksgiving before meat, savor the petition
well, that prays for peace.

Second gentleman:
I've never heard any soldier hate it.

LUCIO:
I believe you ; because I don't think you've ever been anywhere
grace has been said.

Second gentleman:
No? at least a dozen times.

First Sir:
What, in meters?

LUCIO:
In any proportion and in any language.

First Sir:
I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO:
Yes why not ? Grace is grace, despite everything
controversy: as, for example, you yourself are a
wicked wicked, despite all grace.

First Sir:
Well, there was only one pair of shears between us.

LUCIO:
I grant; as there can be between lists and
velvet. You are the list.

First Sir:
And you, velvet: you are good velvet; You are
a piece in three piles, I guarantee it: I had for faith
be a list of an English kersey to stack, as you
stacked art, for French velvet. Do I speak
with emotion now?

LUCIO:
I think so ; and, indeed, with the most painful
feeling of your speech: I will, from yours
confession, learn how to start your health; but, while I
live, forget to drink after yourself.

First Sir:
I think I did it wrong, don't you?

Second gentleman:
Yes, that is what you have done, whether you are tainted or free.

LUCIO:
There you go. where does Madame Attenuation come from! I
I bought as many diseases under his roof as possible...

Second gentleman:
What am I praying for?

LUCIO:
Judge.

Second gentleman:
Up to three thousand pains per year.

First Sir:
Yes, and more.

LUCIO:
An extra French crown.

First Sir:
You always represent illnesses in me; but you
art is full of errors; I am healthy.

LUCIO:
No, not as one would say, in good health; but as sonorous as
things that are hollow: your bones are hollow;
impiety has made you a feast.

First Sir:
How now! Which of your hips has the deepest sciatica?

Exaggerated mistress:
Well well; there is one there arrested and transported
the prison was worth five thousand of you all.

Second gentleman:
Who is it, please?

Exaggerated mistress:
Marry, sir, this is Claudio, Signior Claudio.

First Sir:
Claudio in prison? This is not the case.

Exaggerated mistress:
No, but I know it's true: I saw him arrested, I saw
carried him away; and, what is more, within these
three days his head will be cut off.

LUCIO:
But after all this nonsense, I wouldn't want to.
Are you sure?

Exaggerated mistress:
I am too sure of it: and it is to obtain Madame
Juliet with a child.

LUCIO:
Believe me, maybe it is: he promised to meet me twice
hours since, and he has always been accurate in
keeping a promise.

Second gentleman:
Plus, you know, it brings something closer to
speech we had for such a purpose.

First Sir:
But most importantly, I agree with the proclamation.

LUCIO:
Far! let's find out the truth.

Exaggerated mistress:
So what about war, what about sweat, what about
with the gallows and with poverty, I am
shrunk to size.
How now! What's up with you ?

POMPEY:
This man is taken to prison.

Exaggerated mistress:
GOOD; What did he do?

POMPEY:
A woman.

Exaggerated mistress:
But what is his offense?

POMPEY:
Looking for trout in a particular river.

Exaggerated mistress:
What, is there a servant with a child next to him?

POMPEY:
No, but there is a woman with a servant next to him. You have
you haven't heard of the proclamation, have you?

Exaggerated mistress:
What proclamation, man?

POMPEY:
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be demolished.

Exaggerated mistress:
And what will become of those in the city?

POMPEY:
They will represent the seed: they also had come down,
but it was a wise bourgeois who replaced them.

Exaggerated mistress:
But will all our suburban vacation homes be
pulled down?

POMPEY:
Down, mistress.

Exaggerated mistress:
Well, here is indeed a change in the republic!
What will I become ?

POMPEY:
Come; have no fear: there is no shortage of good advisors
customers: even if you change places, you do not need
change jobs; I will always be your tapster.
Courage! we will have pity on you: you who
have almost worn out your eyes during the service, you
will be considered.

Exaggerated mistress:
What is there to do here, Thomas Tapster? let us withdraw.

POMPEY:
Here comes Signor Claudio, led by the provost to
prison; and here is Madame Juliette.

CLAUDIO:
Friend, why do you show me like this to the world?
Take me to prison, where I am incarcerated.

Provost:
I don't do it in a bad character,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

CLAUDIO:
Thus can the Authority of the demigod
Make us pay for our offense by weight
The words of heaven; on whom it will be done, it will be the case;
On whom this will not be the case, then; and yet, it is right.

LUCIO:
Well, how now, Claudio! where does this restraint come from?

CLAUDIO:
Too much freedom, my Lucio, freedom:
As excess is the father of many fasts,
So each worn by immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures pursue,
Like rats ravaging their own plague,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink, we die.

LUCIO:
If I could speak so wisely while under arrest, I would
bring in some of my creditors: and yet, to say
the truth, I aimed to have the happiness of freedom
like the morality of imprisonment. What is your
Offense, Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
Anything other than talking would be offensive again.

LUCIO:
What, it's not murder?

CLAUDIO:
No.

LUCIO:
Lust?

CLAUDIO:
Call it that.

Provost:
Leave, sir! you must go there.

CLAUDIO:
A word, my good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

LUCIO:
A hundred, if that's useful to you.
Is lust monitored this way?

CLAUDIO:
So it is for me: on a real contract
I took possession of Juliette's bed:
You know the lady; my wife is fast,
Except that there is a lack of denunciation
Of external order: we have not come to this,
Only for the propagation of a dowry
Remaining in the trunk of his friends,
Who we thought would meet to hide our love
Until time has made them for us. But there are chances
The stealth of our most common entertainment
The too rude character is written on Juliette.

LUCIO:
With a child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
Unfortunately, though.
And the new deputy now of the duke...
Let it be the fault and a glimpse of the new,
Or if the public body is
A horse on which the governor rides,
Who, newly seated, so that he knows
He can command, it allows him to feel the spur directly;
Let tyranny be in its place,
Or in his seed which fills him,
I'm staggering: but this new governor
Wakes up all the penalties listed
Which, like unscrubbed armor, hang on the wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone around
And none of them were worn; and, for a name,
Now put on the sleepy and slovenly act
Fresh on me: it's probably for a name.

LUCIO:
I guarantee it: and your head feels so ticklish
your shoulders like a milkmaid, if she is in love,
can sigh. Send after the Duke and call upon
him.

CLAUDIO:
I did, but it is nowhere to be found.
Please, Lucio, do me this good service:
This day my sister should enter the cloister
And there, receive his approval:
Inform her of the danger of my condition:
Beg her, in my voice, to make friends
To the strict deputy; ordered himself to analyze it:
I have a lot of hope in this; because in his youth
There is a subject and voiceless dialect,
Such as moving men; plus she has a thriving art
When she plays with reason and discourse,
Well, she can convince.

LUCIO:
I pray she can; as well as for the encouragement of
as, which one else would be subject to serious
imposition, as to the enjoyment of your life, that I
I would be sorry to be so stupidly lost in a
tick-tock game. I'm going to her.

CLAUDIO:
Thank you, good friend Lucio.

LUCIO:
Within two hours.

CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, go!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, holy father; throw away this thought;
Don't believe the dribble of love
Can pierce a full chest. Why do I want you
Giving me a secret port has a purpose
More serious and wrinkled than goals and ends
Burning youth.

BROTHER THOMAS:
Can your Grace speak to this?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My holy sir, no one knows it better than you
How I always loved the suppressed life
And held in slow motion to haunt the assemblies
Where youth, price and insane bravery are kept.
I delivered it to Lord Angelo,
A man of rigor and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and my place here in Vienna,
And he supposes that I have traveled to Poland;
For thus I have poured it out into the common ear,
And so he is received. Now, pious sir,
You will ask me why I do this?

BROTHER THOMAS:
With pleasure, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We have strict statutes and very severe laws.
The necessary pieces and brakes for stubborn weeds,
What we let slip away for nineteen years;
Even like an overgrown lion in a cave,
This is not prey. Now, as loving fathers,
Having bound the threatening branches of the birch,
Only to put it in front of their children
For terror, do not use, over time the rod
Becomes more mocked than feared; therefore our decrees,
Dead to the infliction, they are dead to themselves;
And freedom cuts justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and completely wrong
Everything is fine.

BROTHER THOMAS:
He rested in your grace
To resolve this obstructed justice whenever you want:
And it would have seemed more terrible in you
Than in Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'm afraid, it's too terrible:
If it was my fault for giving people room to act,
"It would be my tyranny to strike them and exasperate them
For what I have asked them to do: for we ask that this be done,
When bad actions have their permissiveness
And not the punishment. This is why, in fact, my father,
I imposed the position on Angelo;
Who can, in the ambush of my name, strike at home,
And yet my nature is never in the fight
To be slandered. And to see its influence,
I will do it, as if it were a brother of your order,
Visit the prince and the people: therefore, I pray you,
Give me the habit and teach me
How can I officially support myself in person
Like a real brother. More reasons for this action
At our greatest leisure, I will return you;
Only this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands to guard with envy; barely admit
Let his blood flow, or his appetite
It is more bread than stone: that is why we will see,
If power changes its objective, what will our appearances be?

ISABELLE:
And you, my sisters, do you not have other privileges?

FRANCISCA:
Aren't they big enough?

ISABELLE:
Yes really ; I do not speak as desiring more;
But I rather wish for stricter restraint
On fraternity, the voters of Sainte Claire.

LUCIO:

ISABELLE:
Who is the one calling?

FRANCISCA:
It's a man's voice. Sweet Isabelle,
Turn the key, and know his business with him;
You can, I cannot; you have not yet taken the oath.
When you have made a wish, you must not speak to men
But in the presence of the prioress:
So, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
He recalls ; Please answer him.

ISABELLE:
Peace and prosperity! Who is calling

LUCIO:
I salute you, virgin, if you are, like these roses on your cheeks
Proclaim that you are not less! Can you replace me
As bring me to the sight of Isabelle,
A novice of this place and the sister-in-law
To his unfortunate brother Claudio?

ISABELLE:
Why “his unhappy brother”? let me ask,
Especially now I have to let you know
I am this Isabella and her sister.

LUCIO:
Gentle and fair, your brother greets you kindly:
So as not to bore you, he is in prison.

ISABELLE:
Woe is me! Why?

LUCIO:
For which, if I could be its judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He has his pregnant friend.

ISABELLE:
Sir, don't tell me your story.

LUCIO:
It's true.
I wouldn't do it - even though it's my familiar sin
With maids to resemble the lapwing and to joke,
Far from the language of the heart, play thus with all the virgins:
I consider you an ensky and holy thing.
By your renunciation of an immortal spirit,
And to speak with sincerity,
Like with a saint.

ISABELLE:
You blaspheme good by making fun of me.

LUCIO:
Do not believe it. Rarity and truth, it is like this:
Your brother and his lover kissed:
As those who feed become satisfied, while the flowering period
What seed the bare fallow brings
In teeming abundance, despite its abundant belly
Expresses its full culture and breeding.

ISABELLE:
Someone with a child next to them? My cousin Juliette?

LUCIO:
This is your cousin ?

ISABELLE:
Adopted; while schoolgirls change their names
By a vain but just affection.

LUCIO:
It's her.

ISABELLE:
Oh, let him marry her.

LUCIO:
That's the point.
The Duke has left here very strangely;
I have bored many gentlemen, myself being one,
In hand and hope for action: but we are learning
By those who know the very nerves of the State,
His gifts were infinitely far away
Of its true conception. In its place,
And with all the line of his authority,
Rules Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
It’s a very snowy broth; the one who never feels
The gratuitous injections and the movements of the senses,
But it demeans and blunts its natural advantage
With benefits of the mind, study and fast.
He - to give fear to use and freedom,
Who have long been subject to the hideous law,
Like mice before lions, she chose an act,
Under what heavy meaning is your brother's life
Fallen: he stops him there;
And closely follows the rigor of the statute,
To make an example. All hope is lost,
Unless you have grace through your righteous prayer
To soften Angelo: and that's my business
“Between you and your poor brother.

ISABELLE:
Is he looking for his life like this?

LUCIO:
Censorship
Already; and, as I understand it, the provost has
An arrest warrant for his execution.

ISABELLE:
Alas! what poor capacity I have in me
To do him good?

LUCIO:
Test the power you have.

ISABELLE:
My power? Alas, I doubt...

LUCIO:
Our doubts are traitors
And makes us lose the good we could often gain
By fearing to try. Go see Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when young girls pursue,
Men give like gods; but when they cry and kneel,
All their petitions are also freely theirs
As they themselves should.

ISABELLE:
I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO:
But quickly.

ISABELLE:
I will answer it directly;
No longer stay but give to the mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
Recommend me to my brother: soon the night
I will send him news of my success.

LUCIO:
I take leave of you.

ISABELLE:
Good sir, goodbye.

ANGELO:
We must not make the law a scarecrow,
Set it up to fear birds of prey,
And let it keep a shape, until it's personalized
Their perch and not their terror.

ESCALUS:
Yes, but still
Let's be lively, and instead reduce a little,
Than to fall and die bruised. Alas, this gentleman
The one I wanted to save had a most noble father!
Let your honor know,
Which I believe to be the strictest in virtue,
That, in the functioning of your own affections,
Was the time consistent with the place or the place with the wish,
Or that the resolute action of your blood
Could have achieved the effect of your own goal,
That you haven't had a moment in your life
He was wrong on this point that now you are censoring him,
And he imposed the law on you.

ANGELO:
It's one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall for. I do not deny,
The jury, recalling the life of the prisoner,
Let the twelve sworn have a thief or two
More guilty than him, they try. What is open to justice,
Let justice take hold: what do the laws know?
What do thieves pass on to thieves? It's very pregnant,
The gem we find, we bend down and take it
Because we see it; but what we don't see
We walk on it and never think about it.
You can't soften his offense like that
For I have had such faults; but tell me instead,
When I, who censure him, offend him,
Let my own judgment shape my death,
And nothing is partial. Sir, he must die.

ESCALUS:
Let it be as your wisdom will.

ANGELO:
Where is the provost?

Provost:
Here, if it pleases your honor.

ANGELO:
See that Claudio
To be executed tomorrow morning at nine o'clock:
Bring him his confessor, so that he may be prepared;
Because this is the culmination of his pilgrimage.

ESCALUS:

ELBOW:
Come, take them: if they are good people
a common good which does nothing other than use its abuses in
common houses, I don't know any law: take them away.

ANGELO:
Well, sir! What is your name? and what is it?

ELBOW:
If it pleases your honor, I am that of the poor duke.
constable, and my name is Elbow: I rely on
justice, sir, and bring him here before your good
honor two notable benefactors.

ANGELO:
Benefactors? GOOD; who are these benefactors? are
They are not criminals?

ELBOW:
If it? please, your honor, I'm not sure what they
are: but they are specific villains, I'm sure
of; and empty of all profanation in the world which
good Christians should have it.

ESCALUS:
It went well ; here is a wise officer.

ANGELO:
Go to: what quality are they? The elbow is your
name? why don't you speak, Elbow?

POMPEY:
He cannot, sir; he is apart.

ANGELO:
What are you, sir?

ELBOW:
Him, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; the one who
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
let's say, snatched from the suburbs; and now she
he professes a hothouse, which I think is also a very sick house.

ESCALUS:
How do you know ?

ELBOW:
My wife, sir, whom I hate before heaven and before your honor,

ESCALUS:
How? your wife ?

ELBOW:
Yes sir ; who, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,

ESCALUS:
So do you hate her?

ELBOW:
I say, sir, that I will hate myself too, as well as
her, that this house, if it is not a whore's house,
it's a shame for his life, because it's an ugly house.

ESCALUS:
How do you know, Constable?

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, through my wife; who, if she had been a woman
cardinally given, could have been accused in
there, fornication, adultery and all impurities.

ESCALUS:
By the woman's means?

ELBOW:
Yes, sir, by the means of Mistress Overdone: but as she
spat in her face, so she challenged him.

POMPEY:
Sir, please Your Honor, that is not the case.

ELBOW:
Prove it to these lackeys here, honorable
man; prove it.

ESCALUS:
Do you hear how he goes astray?

POMPEY:
Sir, she arrived pregnant with a child; and desire,
I reserve Your Honor's reverence for cooked prunes;
sir, we only had two in the house, which at that time,
distant time stood as in a fruit dish, a
a threepence dish; your honors have seen
such dishes; these are not Chinese dishes, but very
good dishes,--

ESCALUS:
Come on, come on: whatever the dish, sir.

POMPEY:
No, indeed, sir, it is not a pin; you are there, in
the right: but to the point. As I said, this
Mistress Elbow, being, as I said, pregnant, and
being big-bellied and desiring, as I said,
prunes; and having only two in the dish, as I said,
Master Froth, this man, having eaten the
rest, as I said, and, as I said, paying them very
honestly; because, as you know, Master Froth, I could
I won't give you threepence anymore.

MOUSSE:
No indeed.

POMPEY:
Very good: being you then, if you are remembered,
break the stones of the above-mentioned prunes,--

MOUSSE:
Yes, that's what I did.

POMPEY:
Well, very good; I tell you then, if you are
I remembered that so and so had passed
healing of the thing you know, unless they kept very
good diet, as I told you,--

MOUSSE:
This is all true.

POMPEY:
Well, all right, then...

ESCALUS:
Come on, you're a boring idiot: to the point. What
was done to Elbow's wife, that he has reason to
complain about? Come tell me about what was done to him.

POMPEY:
Sir, Your Honor cannot get to that yet.

ESCALUS:
No, sir, and I don't think so either.

POMPEY:
Sir, but you will succeed, by your honor
leave. And please look at Master Froth
here, sir; a man earning eighty pounds a year; of which
my father died at Hallowmas: it wasn't at Hallowmas,
Master Moss?

MOUSSE:
New Year’s Eve in Hallond.

POMPEY:
Well, very good; I hope there will be truths. He, sir,
seated, as I said, on a lower chair, sir; it was in
the Grape Cluster, where you will indeed enjoy
sit down, right?

MOUSSE:
I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.

POMPEY:
Well, very good, then; I hope there will be truths.

ANGELO:
It will last one night in Russia,
When the nights are longest there: I will take my leave.
And let yourself be heard by the cause;
Hope you find a good reason to whip them all.

ESCALUS:
I don't think any less. Good morning to your Lordship.
Now, sir, come on: what have we done to Elbow's wife, again?

POMPEY:
Once, sir? nothing was ever done to him once.

ELBOW:
Please, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY:
I beg your honor, ask me.

ESCALUS:
Well, sir; What did this gentleman do to him?

POMPEY:
I beg you, sir, look at this gentleman's face.
Good Master Froth, look upon his honor; it's for one
good goal. Does your honor mark his face?

ESCALUS:
Yes, sir, very good.

POMPEY:
No; Please note it carefully.

ESCALUS:
Well, I do.

POMPEY:
Does your Honor see evil in his face?

ESCALUS:
Why no.

POMPEY:
I'm supposed to read a book, his face is the worst
thing about him. Well then; if his face is
worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
Did the policeman's wife do any harm? I would know that of
Your Honor.

ESCALUS:
He is right. Constable, what do you say?

ELBOW:
First, like you, the house is respected
House; secondly, he is a respected man; and his
the mistress is a respected woman.

POMPEY:
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person
no one than any of us all.

ELBOW:
Varlet, you lie; you lie, you wicked valet! THE
the time has not yet come when it will one day be respected
with a man, woman or child.

POMPEY:
Sir, she was respected with him before he married her.

ESCALUS:
Who is wiser here? Justice or injustice? East 
It's just?

ELBOW:
O you, codif! O you, varlet! O you wicked
Hannibal! I respected her before I got married
to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
with me, may your adoration not consider me as the poor
officer of the duke. Prove it, evil Hannibal, or
I'll have my battery action on you.

ESCALUS:
If he took a box to your ear, you might have your
action of slander too.

ELBOW:
Get married, I thank your good worship. This is t
what pleasure, your lordship, will I have with this evil boss?

ESCALUS:
Truly, officer, for he has some offenses in him
that you would find out if you could, let him
continue your lessons until you know what they
are.

ELBOW:
Get married, I thank your adoration for this. You see, you
wicked servant, now what is happening to you: you are
continue now, varlet; you must continue.

ESCALUS:
Where were you born, my friend?

MOUSSE:
Here in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS:
Do you weigh eighty kilos a year?

MOUSSE:
Yes, you don't like me, sir.

ESCALUS:
SO. What job do you do, sir?

POMPHEUS:
Cupbearer; a poor widow's merchant.

ESCALUS:
The name of your mistress?

POMPHEUS:
Exaggerated mistress.

ESCALUS:
Did she have more than one husband?

POMPEY:
Nine, sir; Exaggerated by the last one.

ESCALUS:
Nine! Come see me, Master Froth. Master
Mousse, I wouldn't want you to know him
tapsters: they will draw you, Master Mousse, and you
go hang them. Go away and let me hear no
more of you.

MOUSSE:
I thank your adoration. For my part, I have never
walk into any room in a bar, but I'm attracted
In.

ESCALUS:
Well, let's say no more about it, Master Froth: farewell.
Come to me, Master Tapster. What is your
name, master tapster?

POMPEY:
Pompey.

ESCALUS:
What else?

POMPEY:
Tramp, sir.

ESCALUS:
It's true, and your butt is the most beautiful thing about you;
so that, in the most bestial sense, you are Pompey the
Great. Pompey, you are partly a debauchee, Pompey,
no matter how you color it as a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me the truth: it will be best for you.

POMPEY:
In truth, sir, I am a poor boy who would like to live.

ESCALUS:
How would you live, Pompey? by being a whore? What
Are you thinking about the job, Pompey? is this a legal business?

POMPEY:
If the law allows it, sir.

ESCALUS:
But the law does not permit it, Pompey; nor he will
not be allowed in Vienna.

POMPEY:
Does your worship mean gelding and dismissing all
the city's youth?

ESCALUS:
No, Pompey.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, in my opinion they will not then.
If your cult is willing to take matters into its own hands for the drabs and
rascals, we must not fear onlookers.

ESCALUS:
There are some nice orders starting, I can tell you:
it is only directing and hanging.

POMPEY:
If you head over and hang all that, it's offensive that way, but
for ten years together, you will be happy to distribute a
commission for more heads: if this law holds
Vienna in ten years, I will rent the most beautiful house there
after threepence the bay: if you live to see it
comes, say that Pompey told you.

ESCALUS:
Thank you, good Pompey; and, as a reward for your
prophecy, listen: I advise you, let me not find
you again before me on any complaint;
no, not to stay where you live: if I do so, Pompey,
I'll beat you to your tent and get crafty
Caesar to you; with all simplicity, Pompey, I will
did you whip? So, this time, Pompey, be well.

POMPEY:
I thank Your Excellency for your good advice:
but I will follow him according to the flesh and fortune
better determine.
Whip me? No no; let Carman whip his jade:
The brave heart is not expelled from his profession.

ESCALUS:
Come to me, Master Elbow; come here, Master
policeman. How long have you held this post of constable?

ELBOW:
Seven and a half years, sir.

ESCALUS:
I thought that, thanks to your availability at the office, you had
I continued there for some time. You say, seven years together?

ELBOW:
And a half, sir.

ESCALUS:
Sadly, this has caused you great suffering. They make you
it's wrong to talk to you about it so often: aren't there men
in your parish is it sufficient to serve it?

ELBOW:
Well, sir, there is little wit in such matters: as they
are chosen, they are happy to choose me for them; I
do it for some money and move on with it
all.

ESCALUS:
Listen, you bring me the names of six or seven people,
the most sufficient in your parish.

ELBOW:
At your Honor's house, sir?

ESCALUS:
At home. Be well.
What time do you think?

Justice:
Eleven, sir.

ESCALUS:
Please come home and have dinner with me.

Justice:
I humbly thank you.

ESCALUS:
Claudio's death saddens me;
But there is no cure.

Justice:
Lord Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS:
It is but necessary:
Mercy is not itself, as it often seems;
Forgiveness is always the nurse of the second misfortune:
But still, poor Claudio! There is no cure.
Come, sir.

Servant:
He hears of a cause; he will come straight
I'll tell him about you.

Provost:
Please do it.
I will know
His pleasure ; maybe he will give in. Alas,
He was only offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages feel this vice; and he
Die for this!

ANGELO:
Now what's the matter. Provost?

Provost:
Do you want Claudio to die tomorrow?

ANGELO:
Didn't I tell you yes? had you not ordered?
Why do you ask again?

Provost:
Lest I be too rash:
Under your good correction I saw,
When, after the execution, the judgment has
He repented of his fate.

ANGELO:
Go to; let it be mine:
Make yourself your office, or give up your place,
And you will be well spared.

Provost:
I beg your Honor's forgiveness.
What to do, sir, with the moaning Juliette?
She is very close to her time.

ANGELO:
Do you have her
To a fitter place, and quickly.

Servant:
This is the sister of the condemned man
Desires access to you.

ANGELO:
Does he have a sister?

Provost:
Yes, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And to soon be a fraternity,
If it is not done yet.

ANGELO:
Well, let her be admitted.
See you soon the fornicator will be removed:
Let us have the necessary means, but not sumptuous;
There will be order for that.

Provost:
God save your honor!

ANGELO:
Stay a little.
You’re welcome: what is your will?

ISABELLE:
I am a sad pretender to your honor,
Please, but your honor, listen to me.

ANGELO:
GOOD; what is your costume?

ISABELLE:
There is one vice that I hate the most,
And most desires should suffer the blow of justice;
For this I would not plead, but I must do it;
For which I must not plead, but which I am
At war between will and non-will.

ANGELO:
GOOD; the question?

ISABELLE:
I have a brother who is condemned to die:
I beg you, let it be his fault,
And not my brother.

Provost:

ANGELO:
Condemn the fault and not the actor?
Well, every fault is condemned before it is committed:
Mine were the very number of a function,
To amend the faults for which the fine is registered,
And let go of the actor.

ISABELLE:
O just but severe law!
I had a brother then. Heaven preserve your honor!

LUCIO:

ISABELLE:
Should he die?

ANGELO:
Girl, no cure.

ISABELLE:
Yes; I think you could forgive him,
And neither heaven nor man grieves because of this mercy.

ANGELO:
I will not do it.

ISABELLE:
But can you, if you want?

ANGELO:
Look, what I don't want, I can't do.

ISABELLE:
But could you do it and not harm the world,
If so, your heart has been touched by this remorse
Like mine is for him?

ANGELO:
He is condemned; it's too late.

LUCIO:

ISABELLE:
Too late? why no ; Me, who says a word.
Maybe call him back. Well, believe it,
No ceremony awaiting the grown-ups,
Neither the king's crown nor the deputy's sword,
The marshal's baton, nor the judge's robe,
Become them with half so good grace
As does mercy.
If he had been like you and you like him,
You would have slipped like him; but he, like you,
It wouldn't have been as severe.

ANGELO:
Please leave.

ISABELLE:
I wish in heaven I had your power,
And you were Isabel! should it be like this?
No; I would say what it is like to be a judge,
And what a prisoner.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Your brother is a crime against the law,
And you're just wasting your words.

ISABELLE:
Alas, alas!
Well, all the souls that were were lost once;
And the one who could have taken the best position
I discovered the cure. How would you be,
If He, who is the summit of judgment, were to
But judging you as you are? Oh, think about it;
And then mercy will breathe on your lips,
Like a newly created man.

ANGELO:
Be content, beautiful young girl;
It's the law, I don't condemn your brother:
Was he my parent, my brother or my son,
It should be like this: he must die tomorrow.

ISABELLE:
Tomorrow! Oh, it's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
He is not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the seasonal birds: will we serve the sky
With less respect than us, minister
To our gross selves? Well, good monsignor, think about it;
Who is the one who died for this crime?
Many people have committed it.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
The law is not dead, even if it slept:
Many had not dared to do this evil,
If the first who made the edict broke
Had answered for his act: now he is awake
Take note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
Look into a glass, which shows what future evils,
Either new or new designed by negligence,
And so in the process of hatching and birth,
No longer must have successive diplomas,
But before they live, it's over.

ISABELLE:
But show a little mercy.

ANGELO:
I show it especially when I show justice;
For then I pity those whom I do not know,
Which would be an offense rejected after the gall;
And do him well, responding to a fault,
He does not live to act on others. To be satisfied;
Your brother dies tomorrow; be happy.

ISABELLE:
So you must be the first to say this sentence,
And he suffers. Oh, it's excellent
Have the strength of a giant; but it's tyrannical
To use it like a giant.

LUCIO:

ISABELLE:
Could great men thunder
Like Jupiter himself, Jupiter would never be silent,
For every skinning, master
Would use his sky for thunder;
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
You rather, with your sharp and sulphurous lightning
Split'st the non-stuck and knotty oak
Than the sweet myrtle: but man, proud man,
Dress yourself with a little brief authority,
The most ignorant of what he is most assured of,
Its glassy essence, like an angry monkey,
Play such fantastic tricks before the sky
Like making angels cry; who, with our spleen,
They would all laugh to death.

LUCIO:

Provost:

ISABELLE:
We cannot weigh our brother with ourselves:
Great men can joke with saints; it's spirit in them,
But in the least ignoble desecration.

LUCIO:
You are right, my daughter; more o, that.

ISABELLE:
That in the captain's word it was only an angry word,
Which for the soldier is pure blasphemy.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Why do you impose these words on me?

ISABELLE:
Because authority, even if it makes mistakes like the others,
Still has some kind of medicine in itself,
This scratches the vice at the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there and ask your heart what it knows
It's like my brother's fault: if he confesses
A natural guilt like his,
Don't let a thought pass on your tongue
Against my brother's life.

ANGELO:

ISABELLE:
Sweet my lord, come back.

ANGELO:
I will remember: come back tomorrow.

ISABELLE:
Listen to how I will bribe you: well my lord, go back.

ANGELO:
How! bribe me?

ISABELLE:
Yes, with such gifts that heaven will share with you.

LUCIO:

ISABELLE:
Not with precious shekels of tested gold,
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
As fantasy values them; but with real prayers
It will be in heaven and will enter there
Before sunrise, prayers of preserved souls,
Fasting maids whose spirits are devoted
Nothing temporal.

ANGELO:
GOOD; come see me tomorrow.

LUCIO:

ISABELLE:
Heaven keep your honor safe!

ANGELO:

ISABELLE:
At what time tomorrow
Shall I attend your lordship?

ANGELO:
Any time before noon.

ISABELLE:
“Save your honor!”

ANGELO:
Of you, even of your virtue!
What is it, what is it? Is it his fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins more?
Ha!
Not her: she doesn't try either: but it's me
That, lying near the violet in the sun,
Be like the carrion, not like the flower,
Corrupted with a virtuous season. Can it be
This modesty can further betray our feeling
Than the lightness of woman? Having enough vacant land,
Should we desire to raze the sanctuary
And plant our evils there? Oh, fi, fi, fi!
What are you doing, or what are you, Angelo?
Do you desire her grossly for these things
Does that make it good? Oh, let his brother live!
Thieves for their theft have authority
When judges steal from themselves. What, do I love him,
How I long to hear him speak again,
And feast on his eyes? What am I dreaming of?
O cunning enemy, who, to catch a saint,
With the saints, bait your hook! The most dangerous
Is it temptation that pushes us
Sin while loving virtue: the trumpet could never,
With all its double vigor, art and nature,
Once, stir my mood; but this virtuous servant
It completely subdues me. Even until now,
When men were affectionate, I smiled and wondered how.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hello, Provost! so I think so.

Provost:
I am the provost. What is your will, my good brother?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bound by my charity and my blessed order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Give me common law
To let me see them and let me know
The nature of their crimes, so that I can exercise
To them accordingly.

Provost:
I would do more than that, if more was needed.
Look, here's one: one of my ladies,
Who, falling into the failings of his own youth,
He put a blister in his report: she is pregnant;
And he who had it was condemned; a young man
More likely to commit another offense of this type
Than die for it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
When should he die?

Provost:
As I think, tomorrow.
I have provided for you: stay a little,
And you will be led.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Repent, beautiful, of the sin you bear?

JULIET:
I do; and bears shame with great patience.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I will teach you how to bring your conscience to justice,
And test your penance, if it is healthy,
Or hollowed out.

JULIET:
I will learn with pleasure.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you love the man who wronged you?

JULIET:
Yes, how I love the woman who wronged him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So it seems your most offensive act
Was he mutually committed?

JULIET:
Mutually.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your sin was then more serious than his.

JULIET:
I admit it and I repent of it, father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is so, my daughter; but lest you repent,
As sin brought you to this shame,
What sadness is always towards ourselves and not towards heaven,
Showing that we would not spare the sky as we love it,
But since we are afraid,...

JULIET:
I repent, because it is evil,
And take the shame with joy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He's staying.
Your partner, I hear, is due to die tomorrow,
And I will give him instructions.
Grace accompanies you, Bénédicte!

JULIET:
I must die tomorrow! O harmful love,
This leaves me with a life whose very comfort
It's still a dying horror!

Provost:
It's a shame for him.

ANGELO:
When I prayed and thought, I thought and prayed
On several subjects. Heaven has my empty words;
While my invention, not hearing my language,
Anchors on Isabel: paradise in my mouth,
As if I were just chewing his name;
And in my heart the strong and growing evil
Of my design. The state I studied in
It's like a good thing to be read often,
Became fearful and annoying; yes, my gravity,
Hence, let no one hear me, I am proud,
Can I change startup for an inactive plume,
Let the air beat in vain. O place, o form,
How often do you deal with your case, your habit,
Remove the fear of fools and bind the wisest souls
At your false appearance! Blood, you are blood:
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
It's not the devil's crest.
How now! Who is here?

Servant:
A certain Isabel, a sister, wishes to have access to you.

ANGELO:
Teach him the way.
O heaven!
Why does my blood gather like this to my heart,
Making him incapable of being self-sufficient,
And dispossess all my other parts
Necessary physical condition?
So play foolish crowds with him who faints;
Everyone come and help him, and thus stop the air
By what he should live again: and still
The general, subject to a welcome king,
Leaving their own role, and in obsequious tenderness
Crowd in his presence, where their uncultivated love
It has to appear offensive.
And now, beautiful girl?

ISABELLE:
I have just heard of your pleasure.

ANGELO:
Just so you know, you better please me
Than demand what it is. Your brother cannot live.

ISABELLE:
Anyway. Heaven preserve your honor!

ANGELO:
Yet may he live for a while; and maybe,
As long as you or me, he must die.

ISABELLE:
Under your sentence?

ANGELO:
Yeah.

ISABELLE:
When, I beg you? that in his reprieve,
More or less long, it can be adjusted
So that his soul is not sick.

ANGELO:
Ha! fi, these dirty vices! It was also good
To forgive the one who stole from nature
A man already made, ready to be put back
Their impertinent sweetness which marks the image of the sky
In banned stamps: it's just as simple
Falsely to take away a life truly made
As for putting metal in restrained means
To make it a fake.

ISABELLE:
It is so in heaven, but not on earth.

ANGELO:
Do you say it? then I will ask you quickly.
What made you prefer the fairest law
Now you have taken your brother's life; or, to redeem it,
Abandon your body to such sweet impurity
Like her that he stained?

ISABELLE:
Sir, believe this,
I prefer to give my body rather than my soul.

ANGELO:
I'm not talking about your soul: our forced sins
Represents more of a number than a count.

ISABELLE:
How do you say ?

ANGELO:
No, I won't guarantee it; because I can speak
Against what I say. Answer this:
I, now the voice of the law recorded,
Say a sentence about your brother's life:
Could there be no charity in sin?
To save this brother's life?

ISABELLE:
Please don't do it,
I will take it as a peril for my soul,
This is not a sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO:
I pleased you not to do it at the risk of your soul,
Were an equal balance of sin and charity.

ISABELLE:
That I ask for his life, if it is a sin,
Heaven, let me bear it! you grant my trial,
If it's a sin, I'll make it my morning prayer
To add to my faults,
And nothing from your response.

ANGELO:
No, but listen to me.
Your sense does not follow mine: either you are ignorant,
Or appear so artfully; and that's not good.

ISABELLE:
Let me be ignorant and no good,
But fortunately to know that I'm not getting better.

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom wishes to appear the brightest
When he imposes himself; like these black masks
Proclaim protected beauty ten times louder
That beauty could be exposed. But notice me;
To be received clearly, I will speak more crudely:
Your brother must die.

ISABELLE:
SO.

ANGELO:
And his offense is such, it seems,
Accountant with the law on this pain.

ISABELLE:
TRUE.

ANGELO:
Admit no other means of saving his life,--
As I do not subscribe to this or any other,
But in the loss of the question, that you, his sister,
Finding yourself desired by such a person,
Whose credit with the judge, or his own great place,
I could get your brother back from the handcuffs
Of the law of all buildings; and that there was
No earthly means to save him, but that neither
You must lay down the treasures of your body
At this supposed, or else let him suffer;
What would you do?

ISABELLE:
As much for my poor brother as for me:
In other words, if I were under the influence of death,
The impression of sharp whips that I would carry like rubies,
And undress me to death, like for a bed
This desire made me sick before it gave in
My body is ashamed.

ANGELO:
So your brother must die.

ISABELLE:
And it was the cheapest way:
Better for a brother to die instantly,
That a sister, by redeeming him,
Should die forever.

ANGELO:
Were you not then as cruel as the sentence
Whom have you thus slandered?

ISABELLE:
Ignomy as a ransom and free forgiveness
Are of two houses: legitimate mercy
This has nothing to do with filthy redemption.

ANGELO:
Lately you seemed to be making a tyrant of the law;
And rather proved your brother's slippage
A cheerfulness rather than a vice.

ISABELLE:
Oh, forgive me, my lord; it often falls,
To have what we would have, we don't say what we want to say:
I excuse something the thing I hate,
For its advantage that I really like.

ANGELO:
We are all fragile.

ISABELLE:
Otherwise, let my brother die,
If it is not a feudal, but only him
Must and succeed in your weakness.

ANGELO:
No, women are fragile too.

ISABELLE:
Yes, like the glasses where they see themselves;
Which are as easy to break as they are to create shapes.
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
By taking advantage of it. No, call us fragile ten times;
For we are as gentle as our complexion,
And gullible to false fingerprints.

ANGELO:
I think so:
And according to this testimony from your own sex,...
Since I guess we're made not to be stronger
That faults may shake our bodies, let me be bold;
I stop your words. Be what you are,
That is to say a woman; if you are more, you are nothing;
If you are one, as you put it well
By all external mandates, show it now,
By donning the planned livery.

ISABELLE:
I have only one tongue: sweet my lord,
Let me beg you to speak the ancient language.

ANGELO:
Conceive clearly, I love you.

ISABELLE:
My brother loved Juliette,
And you tell me he will die for it.

ANGELO:
He won't, Isabel, if you give me love.

ISABELLE:
I know your virtue has license,
Which sounds a little more disgusting than it is,
To snatch others.

ANGELO:
Believe me, on my honor,
My words express my purpose.

ISABELLE:
Ha! little honor to be much believed,
And the most pernicious goal! Apparently, apparently!
I will proclaim you, Angelo; look for it:
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
Or with a tight throat I'll tell the world out loud
What a man you are.

ANGELO:
Who will believe you, Isabel?
My name intact, the austerity of my life,
I vouch against you, and my place in the state,
Will your accusation weigh like this,
That you will suffocate in your own report
And it smacks of slander. I started,
And now I give free rein to my sensual course:
Adapt your consent to my keen appetite;
Lay by all the delicacy and prolix blushes,
This banishes what they are pursuing; redeem your brother
By abandoning your body to my will;
Or else he must not only die a death,
But your wickedness will lead to his death
To persistent suffering. Answer me tomorrow,
Or, by the affection that guides me most now,
I'm going to prove him a tyrant. As for you,
Say what you can, my fake outweighs your real one.

ISABELLE:
Who should I complain to? Did I say that,
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
Who carry within them one and the same language,
Either of condemnation or of approval;
By ordering the law to do court to their will:
Hanging on good and evil to the appetite,
To be continued as the draw progresses! I go to my brother:
Although he fell because of blood,
Yet he has such a spirit of honor within him.
This, did he have twenty heads to offer
On twenty bloody blocks he would return them,
In front of his sister, should his body lower himself
To such abhorred pollution.
So, Isabelle, live chastely, and, brother, die:
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll tell him about Angelo's request,
And adapt his mind to death, for the rest of his soul.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So you hope for forgiveness from Lord Angelo?

CLAUDIO:
The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope:
I have hope of living and I am ready to die.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be absolute for death; either death or life
This will be the sweetest. So let's reason with life:
If I lose you, I lose something
That only fools would keep: you are a breath,
Servile to all celestial influences,
That's what this dwelling does, where you stand,
Hourly Affliction: Simply, you are a fool of death;
For him you work by your escape to avoid
And yet, I still run towards him. You are not noble;
For all the accommodations you put up with
Are nourished by baseness. You are by no means valiant;
Because you fear the soft and tender fork
From a poor worm. Your best rest is sleep,
And you often provoke this; but I'm terribly afraid
Your death, which is no more. You are not yourself;
Because you exist on several thousand grains
This problem has risen from the dust. You are not happy;
Because what you don't have, you always strive to get,
And what you have, forget it. You're not sure;
Because your complexion takes on strange effects,
After the moon. If you are rich, you are poor;
For, like a donkey whose back bows with ingots,
You only carry your heavy riches for a journey,
And death discharges you. You have no friend;
For your own insides, which call you father,
The simple effusion of your own kidneys,
Curse gout, serpigo and colds,
For killing you immediately. You are neither young nor old,
But, so to speak, a sleep after dinner,
Dreaming of both; for all your blessed youth
Becomes old and asks for alms
From paralyzed field; and when you are old and rich,
You have neither warmth, nor affection, nor limb, nor beauty,
To make your riches pleasant. What's still in there?
Who is named after life? Yet in this life
He has hidden a thousand deaths: yet we fear death,
This makes these chances equal.

CLAUDIO:
I humbly thank you.
In an attempt to live, I find that I seek to die;
And, in seeking death, find life: let it come.

ISABELLE:

Provost:
Who is here? enter: the wish deserves a welcome.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dear sir, I will visit you again soon.

CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I thank you.

ISABELLE:
My business is a word or two with Claudio.

Provost:
And very welcome. Listen, signor, here is your sister.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, a word with you.

Provost:
As much as you want.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bring me to hear them speak, where I might be hidden.

CLAUDIO:
Now, sister, what's the comfort?

ISABELLE:
For what,
As all comforts are; very good, really very good.
Lord Angelo, having adventures with heaven,
Destined you for his quick ambassador,
Where you will be an eternal leiger:
This is why your best appointment is made promptly;
Tomorrow you leave.

CLAUDIO:
There is no cure?

ISABELLE:
None, but such a remedy as, to save a head,
To split a heart in two.

CLAUDIO:
But are there any?

ISABELLE:
Yes, brother, you can live:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you ask for it, it will free your life,
But I will chain you to death.

CLAUDIO:
A perpetual duration?

ISABELLE:
Yes, right; a perpetual duration, a withholding,
Even if you had all the immensity of the world,
At a specific range.

CLAUDIO:
But of what nature?

ISABELLE:
In such a case, you consent,
I would bark your honor from this trunk you carry,
And leaves you naked.

CLAUDIO:
Let me know the point.

ISABELLE:
Oh, I fear you, Claudio; and I tremble,
Lest a feverish life entertain you,
And six or seven winters no more respect
What a perpetual honor. Would you dare to die?
The feeling of death is above all that of apprehension;
And the poor beetle we walk on,
Bodily suffering finds pain as great
Like when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO:
Why are you giving me this shame?
I think I can find a resolution
Of flowery tenderness? If I have to die,
I will meet darkness as a bride,
And hold him in my arms.

ISABELLE:
There spoke my brother; there, my father's grave
I made a voice. Yes, you must die:
You are too noble to keep a life
In basic devices. This seemingly holy deputy,
Whose calm face and deliberate speech
Clamp youth in the head and madness emew them
Like the hawk the bird, he is nevertheless a devil
His filth being thrown away, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.

CLAUDIO:
The prenzie Angelo!

ISABELLE:
Oh, it's hell's cunning livery,
The damn body to invest and cover
In the prenzie guards! Do you think so, Claudio?
If I gave him my virginity,
You could be released.

CLAUDIO:
O heaven! it can not be.

ISABELLE:
Yes, he would give you, because of this grave offense,
So to offend him again. Tonight is the time
That I should do what I hate to name,
Or you die tomorrow.

CLAUDIO:
You won't do it.

ISABELLE:
Oh, if only my life,
I would throw it away for your deliverance
As straight as a pin.

CLAUDIO:
Thank you, dear Isabelle.

ISABELLE:
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

CLAUDIO:
Yes. Does he have affection in him,
This can therefore make him bite the law by the nose,
When would he force it? Of course it's not a sin,
Or of the seven murderers, to say the least.

ISABELLE:
What is the least?

CLAUDIO:
If it were damnable, being so wise,
Why would he take the momentary turn
Be sentenced to a lasting fine? O Isabelle!

ISABELLE:
What does my brother say?

CLAUDIO:
Death is a scary thing.

ISABELLE:
And life is shameful and hateful.

CLAUDIO:
Yes, but to die and go who knows where;
To lie down in a cold obstruction and rot;
This warm and meaningful movement to become
A kneaded lump; and the spirit delighted
Bathe in fiery waves or reside
In an exciting region of thick ice;
To be imprisoned in the invisible winds,
And blown with agitated violence all around
The suspended world; or be worse than worse
Of those who thought lawless and uncertain
Imagine yourself screaming: it’s so horrible!
The most tired and hated worldly life
This age, this pain, this misery and this imprisonment
Being able to lie down in nature is a paradise
That we fear death.

ISABELLE:
Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO:
Sweet sister, let me live:
What sin do you do to save a brother's life,
Until now, nature exempts from the act
Let this become a virtue.

ISABELLE:
O beast!
O unfaithful coward! O dishonest wretch!
Do you want to become a man of my vice?
It's not some kind of incest to take life
From the shame of your own sister? What should I think?
Shield of heaven, my mother played honestly with my father!
For a piece of desert so distorted
Never out of his blood. Take my challenge!
Die, die! Maybe, but I'm leaning
Delivering you from your fate, this should proceed:
I will say a thousand prayers for your death,
No words to save you.

CLAUDIO:
No, listen to me, Isabel.

ISABELLE:
Oh, fi, fi, fi!
Your sin is not accidental, but a business.
Mercy towards you would prove debauched:
You better die quickly.

CLAUDIO:
O listen to me, Isabelle!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Give me a word, young sister, but a word.

ISABELLE:
What is your will?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Could you do without your hobbies, I will soon
by discussing with you: the satisfaction that I
what is needed is also your own advantage.

ISABELLE:
I have no superfluous leisure activities; my stay must be
stole in other matters; but I will accompany you for a while.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Son, I heard what happened between you
and your sister. Angelo never had the goal of
corrupt her; only he did a test on her
virtue of practicing one's judgment with the disposition
of natures: she, having in herself the truth of honor,
gave him this gracious denial that he is the most
happy to receive. I am Angelo's confessor and I
know that it is true; so prepare yourself to
death: do not satisfy your resolve with hopes
who are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
Get on your knees and get ready.

CLAUDIO:
Let me ask my sister for forgiveness. I'm so desperate for love
with life that I will sue to get rid of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Stand there: goodbye.
Provost, a word to you!

Provost:
What is your will, father

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That now you have come, you will be gone. Leave me
a moment with the servant: my spirit promises with my
habit, no loss will touch her in my company.

Provost:
On time.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The hand that made you beautiful has made you good:
the goodness that does not cost much in beauty makes beauty
in short in kindness; but grace, being the soul of
your complexion will always keep the body
fair. The assault that Angelo made on you,
fortune transmitted my understanding to me; and but
that fragility has examples of its fall, I should
I ask Angelo. How are you going to satisfy this
replace, and to save your brother?

ISABELLE:
I will now resolve it: I rather had my
my brother is dead by law more than my son should be
born illegally. But, oh, how much does the good duke cost
tricked into Angelo! If he ever comes back and I can
speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
discover his government.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This won't be a problem: however, as the question says
now standing, he will avoid your accusation; he did
trial of you only. So attach your ear to my
advice: to the love that I have to do good
the remedy presents itself. I make myself believe
so that you most honestly harm the poor
lady a deserved advantage; redeem your brother from
the angry law; do not stain your own grace
person; and I really like the absent Duke, if
perhaps he will come back one day to hear about
this case.

ISABELLE:
Let me hear you talk further. I have some mind to do
whatever does not seem impure in the truth of my mind.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue is bold and kindness is never afraid. To have
you haven't heard of Mariana, the sister of
Frederick the great soldier who had a miscarriage at sea?

ISABELLE:
I have heard of this lady and good words accompanied her name.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
She should have married this Angelo; was engaged
to her by oath, and the marriage fixed: between
what date of the contract and deadline
solemnity, his brother Frederick was shipwrecked at sea,
having perished in this ship the dowry of his
sister. But notice how far this has come to
poor lady: there she lost a nobleman and
famous brother, in his love towards her always the most
kind and natural; with him, the portion and the sinew of
her fortune, her marriage dowry; with both, she
combined husband, this Angelo who seems good.

ISABELLE:
Is it possible ? Did Angelo abandon her like this?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I left her in her tears and didn't dry any of them
with its comfort; swallowed his wishes whole,
pretending in his discoveries of dishonor: in some,
granted her her own lament, which she still has
carries for him; and he, a marble to his tears,
is washed with them, but does not give way.

ISABELLE:
What merit was it in death to take this poor servant
of the world! What corruption in this life, that
that will let this man live! But how can she benefit from it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It's a breakup you can easily heal: and the
healing not only saves your brother, but keeps
dishonor you by doing this.

ISABELLE:
Show me how, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This named servant still has continuity in her
of his first affection: his unjust wickedness,
in all reason he should have extinguished his love,
like an obstacle in the current, it made it more
violent and undisciplined. Go to Angelo's; respond to his
demand with plausible obedience; agree with
his demands are straight to the point; refer only to
this advantage, first of all, that your stay with him can
does not belong; that time may have every shadow and
silence within; and the location responds to convenience.
This being granted in progress, and now follows
everything, we will advise this wronged girl to stand up
your date, go to your place; if the meeting
recognize herself subsequently, she will be able to force him to
his reward: and behold, hereby, your brother
saved, your honor intact, poor Mariana
advantaged, and the corrupt MP gained momentum. The maid
will I supervise and prepare his attempt. If you
think about wearing that as best you can, duality
of benefit defends deception against reproach.
What do you think ?

ISABELLE:
The image of it already gives me content; and me
I trust that he will reach the most prosperous perfection.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A lot of it depends on your stamina. Hurry up quickly
to Angelo: if for this night he begs you to go to his house
bed, give him a promise of satisfaction. I will
currently in Saint-Luc: there, on the edge of the moat
barn, resides this dejected Mariana. At this
call me; and sends with Angelo, that
it could be quick.

ISABELLE:
I thank you for this comfort. Farewell, good father.

ELBOW:
No, if there is no cure, but you will
needs to buy and sell men and women like animals, we
will make everyone drink a brown and white bastard.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O heaven! what is there here

POMPEY:
It has never been a happy world since, from two wears, the
the most joyful was repressed, and the worst was permitted by
order of the law, a fur-lined robe to keep him warm; And
stuffed with fox and lamb skins too, to signify that
craftsmanship, richer than innocence, represents the covering.

ELBOW:
Come to you, sir. “Bless you, good father brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you, good brother father. What offense has
did this man create you, sir?

ELBOW:
Marry you, sir, he has offended the law: and, sir, we
take him for a thief too, sir; because we found
on him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
sent to the MP.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fi, sir! a whore, a bad whore!
The evil you cause to be done,
It's your way of living. Do you only think
What is it to stuff a face or clothe a back
Of such a filthy vice: tell yourself,
Of their abominable and bestial touches
I drink, I eat, I dress and I live.
Can you believe that your life is a life,
So it stinks, it depends? Go fix, go fix.

POMPEY:
Indeed, it stinks one way or another, sir; but still,
sir, I would prove...

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Moreover, if the devil has given you proof of your sin,
You will prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Both correction and instruction must work
Before this rude beast takes advantage of it.

ELBOW:
He must do it in front of the deputy, sir; he gave him
warning: MP cannot tolerate a master whore: if
if he be a fornicator, and he comes before him, he was
you might as well go a kilometer and a half to do your shopping.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That we were all, as some seem to be,
From our faults, like the faults of appearance, free!

ELBOW:
His neck will come to your waist, a rope, sir.

POMPEY:
I see comfort; I scream under caution. Here is a gentleman and a
A friend of mine.

LUCIO:
Well, noble Pompey! What, at the wheel of
Caesar? are you led in triumph? What, is there
none of the images of Pygmalion, a newly created woman, are
had now, to put his hand in his pocket and
remove it from the clutch? What an answer, eh? What
what do you say about this, material and method? Is not it
not drowned in the last rain, ha? What are you saying
you, Trot? Is the world the way it was, man? Which one is
the path? Is it sad and few words? or how? THE
a tip?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Always so, and so; even worse !

LUCIO:
How is my dear piece, your mistress? She obtains
anyway, eh?

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, she has eaten all her beef, and she
is herself in the bathtub.

LUCIO:
Well, that's good; it is his right; this must be
so: always your fresh whore and your powdered whore:
a consequence not avoided; it must be so. Art goes
in prison, Pompey?

POMPEY:
Yes, my word, sir.

LUCIO:
Well, that's not bad, Pompey. Farewell: go, I say
sent you there. For the debt, Pompey? or how?

ELBOW:
To be a whore, to be a whore.

LUCIO:
Well, imprison him: if imprisonment is the
because of a whore, well, that's his right: he's a whore
no doubt, and from antiquity too; born of debauchery.
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to prison,
Pompey: You will now become a good husband, Pompey; You
will guard the house.

POMPEY:
I hope, sir, that your good worship will be my guarantee.

LUCIO:
No, indeed, Pompey; it's not wear and tear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your servitude: if
you don't take it patiently, well your courage is the
more. Farewell, faithful Pompey. “Bless you, brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you.

LUCIO:
Does Bridget still paint, Pompey, ha?

ELBOW:
Come, sir; come.

POMPEY:
You won't support me, then, sir?

LUCIO:
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, brother?
What's new?

ELBOW:
Come, sir; come.

LUCIO:
Go to the kennel, Pompey; go.
What news, brother, from the Duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I don't know any of them. Can you tell me about it?

LUCIO:
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
some, he is in Rome: but where is he, do you think?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I don't know where; but whatever, I wish him good luck.

LUCIO:
It was a crazy and fantastic trick for him to fly
the state, and usurp the beggar he was never born
has. Lord Angelo is doing well in his absence; he
there is a transgression.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He's doing well.

LUCIO:
A little more indulgence towards lust wouldn't hurt
him: something too grumpy like that, brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.

LUCIO:
Yes, in truth, this vice is very closely related;
it is a good combination: but it is impossible to eradicate it
quite, brother, until eating and drinking are put
down. It is said that this Angelo was not created by man and
woman after this true path of creation: is it
It’s true, do you think?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How would he make it then?

LUCIO:
Some report that a sea-maiden fathered him; some, that he
was generated between two fish stocks. But he is
certain that when he makes water, his urine is
frozen ice; that I know to be true: and it is a
movement generator; it's foolproof.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pleasant, sir, and speak quickly.

LUCIO:
Well, what a ruthless thing that is about him, for the
rebellion of a fly to take the life of a
man! Would the absent Duke have done this?
Before, he would have hanged a man for obtaining a
A hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing care
thousand: he had a certain sense of sport: he
knew the service, and this required him to show mercy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I never heard the absent duke be much detected for
women; he was not inclined to that.

LUCIO:
Oh, sir, you are wrong.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not possible.

LUCIO:
Who, not the Duke? yes, your fifty-year-old beggar; And
its usefulness was to put a ducat in its clack: the
Duke had turds in him. He would be drunk too;
This allows me to inform you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You're hurting him, surely.

LUCIO:
Sir, I was one of his close friends. A shy guy was the
duke: and I think I know the cause of his
withdraw.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What could be the cause, please?

LUCIO:
No sorry ; it's a secret that must be locked away in the
teeth and lips: but I can leave that to you
understand, the subject's largest file held the
Duke to be wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! well, there's no doubt about it, but he was.

LUCIO:
A very superficial, ignorant and light-hearted guy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Either it's envy in you, madness, or a mistake:
the very flow of his life and the affairs he has
crossed out must, in case of justified need, give it a better
proclamation. Let him be but let him testify for himself
children, and he will appear at
envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
This is why you speak badly: or if your
knowledge be more, it is very obscured in your wickedness.

LUCIO:
Sir, I know him and I love him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love speaks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
my dearest love.

LUCIO:
Come, sir, I know what I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I find it hard to believe it, since you don't know what
you speak. But if the Duke ever returns, like our
are prayers possible, let me ask you to do your
answer before him. If it's honest you spoke,
you have the courage to maintain it: I am obliged to call
on you; and, please, your name?

LUCIO:
Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He will know you better, sir, if I can live to see
report to you.

LUCIO:
I don't fear you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Oh, you hope the Duke never comes back; or you
imagine a too harmless opposite. But in fact I
can do you little harm; you will give it up again.

LUCIO:
I will be hanged first: you were wrong in me,
brother. But none of that anymore. Can you say if
Claudio dies tomorrow or not?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why should he die, sir?

LUCIO:
For what? To fill a bottle with a distributor. I would like
the duke of whom we speak was returned again: the
a non-breeding agent will depopulate the province with
continence; sparrows must not build in its
the eaves of houses, because they are lewd. The Duke
yet dark deeds would have a dark response; he would
never bring them to light: would he have come back!
Get married, this Claudio is condemned for unscrewing.
Farewell, good brother: please pray for me. THE
the duke, I tell you again, would eat mutton
Fridays. He has not yet passed this stage, and I tell you:
he would talk to a beggar, even if she smelled brown
bread and garlic: say I said so. Farewell.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No power or greatness in mortality
Can censor 'scape; hurtful slander
The whitest virtue strikes. What a strong king
Can we link the nerve in slanderous language?
But who comes here?

ESCALUS:
Go; take her to prison!

Exaggerated mistress:
Good my lord, be good to me; your honor is counted
a merciful man; well my lord.

ESCALUS:
Double and triple warning, and still forfeit
the same kind! That would make Mercy swear and play
the tyrant.

Provost:
A whore for eleven years in a row, please
Your Honor.

Exaggerated mistress:
My lord, here is a denunciation from Lucio against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was pregnant with him in the
Duke's Hour; he promised her marriage: his child
at a year and a quarter, come Philippe and Jacob:
I kept it myself; and see how he goes about abusing me!

ESCALUS:
This man is a very free man: let him be
called before us. Take her to jail! Go to;
more words.
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be changed;
Claudio must die tomorrow: let him be furnished
with the religious, and have every charitable preparation.
if my brother was provoked by my pity, that shouldn't be the case
so with him.

Provost:
So please, this brother has been with him, and
advised him for the entertainment of death.

ESCALUS:
Very good, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Happiness and goodness to you!

ESCALUS:
From where are you ?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not from this country, although my chance is now
To use it for my time: I am a brother
By courtesy, arriving late from Headquarters
In a special matter of his holiness.

ESCALUS:
What news abroad in the world?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
None, but there is such a high fever
goodness, that its dissolution must cure it:
the novelty is only in the demand; and it's also dangerous
grow old in any kind of path, because it is virtuous
be constant in any business. Not long ago
the truth sufficiently alive to secure societies; but
enough security that the stock exchanges are cursed: a lot
it is on this enigma that the wisdom of the world rests. This
the news is quite old, but yet it is everyday news. I
Please, sir, what disposition was the Duke in?

ESCALUS:
The one who, above all other conflicts, opposed
especially to get to know each other.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What pleasure did he give him?

ESCALUS:
Rather rejoice to see another joyful than joyful to
anything that claimed to make him rejoice: a
gentleman of all temperance. But let's let him do it
its events, with prayer, can prove prosperous;
and let me desire to know how you found Claudio
prepared. I am made to understand that you have
paid him a visit.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He declares that he has not received any sinister measures
of his judge, but very willingly humiliates himself
to the determination of justice: yet he had framed
to himself, by the instruction of his fragility, much
deceptive promises of life; that I by my good
hobbies discredited him, and now he is
determined to die.

ESCALUS:
You have paid to heaven for your function, and the
prisoner the very debt of your vocation. I have
worked to the extreme for the poor gentleman
shore of my modesty: but my brother, justice, have I
found it so serious that he forced me to tell him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
If his own life responds to the difficulty of his
in doing so, it will suit him well; in which if he
chance of failing, he condemned himself.

ESCALUS:
I'm going to visit the prisoner. Be well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
May peace be with you!
The one that the sword of heaven will carry
Should be as holy as it is severe;
Model in itself to know,
Grace remains standing and virtue departs;
More and no less to other paying people
Than by the weighing of self-offenses.
Shame on him whose cruel blow
Kill for mistakes he likes!
Twice triple shame to Angelo,
Weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what can man hide within himself,
Although an angel on the outside!
How can the resemblance be made in crimes,
Practice schedules,
Drawing with strings of idle spiders
Very heavy and substantial things!
Crafts against vice I must apply:
With Angelo tonight will lie
His old but despised fiancée;
So the disguise must, by the disguised,
Pay with lies, false demands,
And execute an old contract.


MARIANNE:
Stop your singing and go quickly:
Here comes a man of comfort, whose counsel
I have often calmed my brawling discontent.
I cry out to you for mercy, sir; and I could well wish
You didn't find me so musical here:
Let me apologize and believe me,
My cheerfulness greatly displeased, but pleased my misfortune.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It's good ; even if the music often has such charm
Make evil good and good cause evil.
Please tell me, has anyone found out
for me here today? a lot of things at the moment have
I promised to meet here.

MARIANNE:
You were not asked about:
I've been sitting here all day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I believe you constantly. The time has come
NOW. I will need your patience a little: that
but I will appeal to you presently, to obtain some advantage for yourself.

MARIANNE:
I am still linked to you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Very well received and well come.
What's the news about this good MP?

ISABELLE:
He has a garden surrounded by bricks,
The west side of which backs onto a vineyard;
And towards this vineyard there is a boarded gate,
It opens with this bigger key:
This other controls a small door
Which leads from the vineyard to the garden;
There I made my promise
In the middle of the night
To call on him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But, to the best of your knowledge, will you be able to find this path?

ISABELLE:
I made a careful note about this:
With whispered and most guilty diligence,
In action while respecting the precepts, he showed me
The path is twofold.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are there no other tokens
Between you, greed regarding its observance?

ISABELLE:
No, none, but only a repair in the dark;
And that I owned it the whole time I was there
Maybe, but in short; because I let him know
I have a servant who accompanies me,
This remains on me, whose persuasion is
I'm coming about my brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is well supported.
I haven't made Mariana known yet
A word of this. What, ho! In! move forward!
Please get to know this young girl;
She comes to do you good.

ISABELLE:
I want the same thing.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you convince yourself that I respect you?

MARIANNE:
Good brother, I know it and I found it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So take your companion by the hand,
Who has a story ready for your ear.
I will take care of your leisure: but hurry;
The misty night is approaching.

MARIANNE:
Don't you want to get out of the way?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O place and grandeur! millions of false eyes
Are stuck on you: report volumes
Run with these false and most contradictory quests
On your actions: a thousand mental escapes
Make you the father of their vain dreams
And torment you in their fantasies.
Welcome, how much do you agree?

ISABELLE:
She will take the business upon herself, father,
If you recommend it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is not my consent,
But so is my plea.

ISABELLE:
You don't have much to say
When you move away from him, but, soft and low,
“Remember now, brother. »

MARIANNE:
Do not fear me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And, sweet girl, fear nothing at all.
This is your pre-contract husband:
To bring you together like this is not a sin,
Sith that the justice of your title on him
Doth flourishes deception. Come on, let's go:
Our corn is to be harvested, but our tithe is to be sown.

Provost:
Come here, sir. Can you cut off a man's head?

POMPEY:
If this man is single, sir, I can; but if he is a
married man, he is the boss of his wife, and I will never be able
cut off a woman's head.

Provost:
Come, sir, leave me your scraps and give me a
direct answer. Tomorrow morning we die Claudio
and Barnardine. Here in our prison is a common place
executioner, who in his office lacks help: if
you will take it upon yourself to assist him, he will do it
redeem yourself from your sorrows; otherwise you will have
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
with a merciless whip, because you have been a
notorious whore.

POMPEY:
Sir, I have experienced an illegal period of debauchery, out of the mind;
but I will still be content to be a legitimate executioner. I
would be happy to receive instructions from my
fellow partner.

Provost:
What, ho! Abhorson! Where is Abhorson over there?

ABHORSON:
Are you calling, sir?

Provost:
Sirrah, here is a guy who will help you tomorrow
your execution. If you think this answers, deal with
him per year, and may he remain here with you; if
no, use it for the present and send it back. He
cannot plead its estimate to you; he was a debauchee.

ABHORSON:
A whore, sir? trust him! he will discredit our mystery.

Provost:
Come on, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will spin
The scale.

POMPEY:
Pray, sir, by your good favor, for surely, sir, a
you have a good favor, but you have a hanging
Listen, do you call your profession, sir, a mystery?

ABHORSON:
Yes sir ; a mystery

POMPEY:
Painting, sir, I have heard it said, is a mystery; And
your whores, sir, being members of my profession,
using paint, prove my craft a mystery:
but what mystery would there be in being hanged, if I
should be hanged, I can't imagine.

ABHORSON:
Sir, it's a mystery.

POMPEY:
Evidence?

ABHORSON:
Every true man's clothes are suitable for your thief: if so
too little for your thief, your real man thinks so
big enough; if it's too big for your thief, your
the thief thinks little about it: so every real man
the clothes suit your thief.

Provost:
Do you agree ?

POMPEY:
Sir, I will serve him; because I find that your executioner is
a profession more penitent than your whore; he does 
ask for forgiveness more often.

Provost:
You, sir, provide your block and your ax
tomorrow four o'clock.

ABHORSON:
Come on, damn it; I will instruct you in my profession; follow.

POMPEY:
I desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have it
opportunity to use me in your turn, you will find
I do; because truly, sir, I owe you your kindness
a good ride.

Provost:
Call Barnardine and Claudio here:
This one has my pity; not a word to the other,
Being a murderer, even though he was my brother.
Listen, here is the arrest warrant, Claudio, for your death:
It's now dead midnight, and tomorrow at eight o'clock
You must become immortal. Where is Barnardine?

CLAUDIO:
As quickly locked in sleep as innocent work
When it lies clearly in the bones of the traveler:
He won't wake up.

Provost:
Who can do him good?
Well, come on, get ready.
But listen, what noise?
Heaven comfort your spirit!
Gradually.
I hope it's a pardon or a reprieve
For the sweetest Claudio.
Welcome dad.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The best and healthiest spirits of the night
Wrap yourself up, good provost! Who has been here recently?

Provost:
None since the curfew rang.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not Isabelle?

Provost:
No.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So they won't be long in doing so.

Provost:
What comfort for Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There is hope.

Provost:
He is a bitter MP.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It’s not, it’s not; his life is parallel
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
He submits with holy abstinence
That in himself which he stimulates by his power
To qualify the others: was he fed with that
What he corrected, then, was he tyrannical;
But this being said, it is correct.
Now they have arrived.
He is a gentle provost: rarely when
The steel jailer is the friend of men.
How now! what noise ? This mind is possessed by haste
It hurts the insensible postern with these blows.

Provost:
He must remain there until the officer
Get up to let him in: he is called.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You don't have a counter-warrant for Claudio yet,
But he must die tomorrow?

Provost:
None, sir, none.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near dawn, provost, as he is,
You'll hear more before morning.

Provost:
Fortunately
You know something; yet I believe that it is happening
No counter-order; we don't have an example of this type:
Furthermore, at the very seat of justice
Lord Angelo must be in the public's ear
He stated the opposite.
He is His Lordship's man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And here is Claudio's forgiveness.

Messenger:

Provost:
I will obey him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost:
I told you. Lord Angelo, I think I blame myself
in my office, wakes me up to this unusual
set up; This seems strange to me, because he has never used it before.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Please, let's listen.

Provost:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is this Barnardine that must be executed in the
afternoon?

Provost:
A Bohemian born, but here fed and raised; A
he is a nine-year-old prisoner.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How come the absent Duke didn't have either
Did he release him or execute him? I
I heard that was always his way of doing it.

Provost:
His friends still granted him reprieves: and,
indeed, its done, hitherto in the government of the Lord
Angelo, has not arrived at incontestable proof.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Is it obvious now?

Provost:
Very manifest and not denied by itself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Was he born a penitent in prison? how
it seems that he is affected?

Provost:
A man who no longer fears death terribly but
like a drunken sleep; carefree, reckless and fearless
of what is past, present or future; insensitive to
mortality and desperately mortal.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He wants advice.

Provost:
He won't hear anything: he has always had freedom
from prison; give him permission to escape, he
would not do it: drunk several times a day, even several days
completely drunk. We woke him up very often, as if
to carry him to execution, and showed him a semblance
It didn't move him at all.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
More from him soon. It is written on your forehead,
provost, honesty and constancy: if I don't read it
in truth, my old know-how seduces me; but, in the
by the audacity of my ruse, I will put myself in danger.
Claudio, that you have here an execution warrant, is
no greater crime for the law than Angelo who
condemned him. To make this clear to you
the effect manifested, I only need four days of respite;
for which you must give me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy.

Provost:
Pray, sir, in what way?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
In delayed death.

Provost:
A lack, how can I do it, having limited time,
and an express order, under penalty, to deliver
his head in Angelo's eyes? I can make my point
like Claudio's, to go through this in every detail.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By my vow, I guarantee you that if my
the instructions can be your guide. Leave this Barnardine
be executed this morning, and his head born to Angelo.

Provost:
Angelo has seen them both and will discover the favor.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, death is a great disguise; and you can add to it.
Shave your head and tie back your beard; and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be thus exposed before his
death: you know the course is common. If something
it's up to you to come across this, more than thank you and good
fortune, by the saint I profess, I will plead
against this with my life.

Provost:
Forgive me, good father; This is against my oath.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you swear the oath to the duke or the deputy?

Provost:
To him and his replacements.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will think that you have committed no offense if the Duke
confess the justice of your conduct?

Provost:
But what is the probability in this?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. However, since I saw
you fear that neither my coat, nor my integrity, nor
persuasion can easily tempt you, I will go
further than I thought, to get rid of all your fears.
Look, sir, here is the hand and the seal of the
duke: you know the character, I have no doubt; and the
the seal is not foreign to you.

Provost:
I know them both.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The content of this is the return of the Duke: you
I will reread it immediately as you wish; or you
will find, in these two days, he will be there.
This is something Angelo doesn't know; for him that
every day he receives letters of strange content;
perhaps from the death of the duke; maybe enter
in a monastery; but, by chance, nothing
is written. Look, the unfolding star calls the
shepherd. Don't be surprised at how these
things should be: all difficulties are only easy
when they are known. Call your executioner, and let's go
with Barnardine's head: I will give him a gift
step aside and recommend a better place. Yet you
are surprised; but this will absolutely solve you.
Come; dawn is almost clear.

POMPEY:
I know myself as well here as at home
by profession: you would think it was Mistress
Overdone's own house, for here are many of his old ones
clients. First of all, here is young Master Rash; he is in
for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
sixty-nine and seventeen pounds; which he did
five marks, cash: get married, then ginger was not
much in demand, because the old women were all dead.
So is there a Master Caper here, at the trial of
Master Trois-pile the mercer, for about four suits of
peach-colored satin, which now gives it a
Beggar. So here we have young Dizy, and young
Master Deep Vow, Master Copperspur and Master
Hungry lackey, the man with the rapier and the dagger, and the young
The heir who killed the vigorous Pudding and the Master
Put forward the rocker and brave Master Shooty the
great traveler and wild half-can who stabbed
Pots, and, I think, forty others; all great actors
our job, and we do it now “for the love of the Lord”.

ABHORSON:
Sirrah, bring Barnardine here.

POMPEY:
Master Barnardine! you must stand up and hang.
Master Barnardine!

ABHORSON:
What, ho, Barnardine!

BARNARDINE:

POMPEY:
Your friends, sir; the executioner. You must be
good, sir, to rise and be put to death.

BARNARDINE:

ABHORSON:
Tell him he needs to wake up, and this quickly.

POMPEY:
Pray, Master Barnardine, wake until you are
executed and then sleep.

ABHORSON:
Go into his house and get him out.

POMPEY:
He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustling.

ABHORSON:
Is the ax on the block, sir?

POMPEY:
Very ready, sir.

BARNARDINE:
What now, Abhorson? What's up with you ?

ABHORSON:
Truly, sir, I would like you to applaud in your
prayers; for, you see, the mandate has arrived.

BARNARDINE:
You thug, I drank all night; I'm not
equipped for this.

POMPEY:
Oh, the better, sir; for the one who drinks all night,
and is hung early in the morning, can sleep on
sounder all the next day.

ABHORSON:
Listen, sir; here is your ghostly father: do
We're joking now, do you think?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing with what haste
you are going to leave, I am coming to advise you, to comfort you
you and pray with you.

BARNARDINE:
Brother, I didn't drink much all night,
and I will have more time to prepare, or else they
I will beat my brains out with tickets: I will not do it
consent to die today, that's certain.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Oh, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
Rejoice in the journey you will take.

BARNARDINE:
I swear I will not die today for the death of a man.
persuasion.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But listen to yourself.

BARNARDINE:
Not a word: if you have something to tell me,
come to my parish; because I won't do it today.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Unfit to live or die: O heart of gravel!
After him, the friends; take him to the OR.

Provost:
Now, sir, how do you like the prisoner?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
An unprepared creature, unfit for death;
And to transport him in the spirit he is
Were damnable.

Provost:
Here in the prison, father,
He died this morning of a cruel fever
A certain Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's age; his beard and his head
Just his color. What if we forgot
This reprobate until he is well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the face
From Ragozine, rather Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Oh, it’s an accident that heaven has in store for us!
Ship it immediately; the time is approaching
Prefix by Angelo: see that this is done,
And sent according to the order; while I
Persuade this crude wretch to die voluntarily.

Provost:
This will be done, my good father, soon.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
And how are we going to continue Claudio,
To save myself from the danger that might arise
If he was known alive?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let it be done.
Put them in secret holds, Barnardine and Claudio:
Twice ago the sun greeted his newspaper
For the sub-generation you will find
Your safety manifested.

Provost:
I am your free dependent.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick, hurry up and send the head to Angelo.
Now I'm going to write letters to Angelo,...
The provost, he will carry them, the contents of which
I will show him that I am near home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
Enter publicly: I would like him
To meet me at the consecrated fountain
A league below the town; and some,
By cold gradation and well-balanced shape,
We will proceed with Angelo.

Provost:
Here is the head; I will wear it myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is convenient. Take a quick look back;
For I would commune with you in such things
Who don't want any other ear than yours.

Provost:
I will go at full speed.

ISABELLE:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Isabel's language. She got to know
If, however, his brother's forgiveness arrives here:
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make his despair a heavenly comfort,
When you least expect it.

ISABELLE:
Ho, with your permission!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hello to you, beautiful and kind girl.

ISABELLE:
The best, was given to me by such a holy man.
Has the MP already sent a pardon to my brother?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He freed him from the world, Isabelle:
His head is cut off and sent to Angelo.

ISABELLE:
No, but that's not the case.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not another: show your wisdom, my daughter,
In your narrow patience.

ISABELLE:
Oh, I'll gouge his eyes out!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will not be admitted to its sight.

ISABELLE:
Unhappy Claudio! miserable Isabelle!
Harmful world! damn Angelo!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This does not harm him and does not benefit you at all;
So abstain; entrust your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, you will find it
With each syllable a faithful truth:
The Duke returns tomorrow; no, dry your eyes;
One of our convent, and his confessor,
Give me this example: he already carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who prepares to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
In this good path that I would like him to take,
And you will have your breast on this wretch,
Grace of the Duke, vengeance to your heart,
And general honor.

ISABELLE:
I am led by you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Give this letter to Brother Pierre;
This is what he sent me from the Duke's return:
Say, by this gesture, I desire his company
At Mariana's tonight. His cause and yours
I will perfect it with this, and it will bring you
In front of the Duke and in front of Angelo's head
Accuse him at home and at home. For my poor me,
I am united by a sacred vow
And will be absent. I am sending you this letter:
Command these agonizing waters from your eyes
Lighthearted ; do not trust my holy command,
If I pervert your course. Who is here?

LUCIO:
Well, even. Brother, where is the provost?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not inside, sir.

LUCIO:
O pretty Isabelle, I am pale to see
your eyes are so red: you have to be patient. I am delighted
dinner and supper with water and bran; I don't dare to
my head fills my stomach; a fruitful meal would define
me to do it. But they say the Duke will be there
tomorrow. By my promise, Isabelle, I loved your brother:
if the fantastic old Duke of Dark Corners had been
at home he had lived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, the Duke is wonderful seeing your
reports; but the best part is that he doesn't live there.

LUCIO:
Brother, you don't know the Duke as well as I do:
he's a better lumberjack than you think.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, you will answer that one day. Be well.

LUCIO:
No, wait; I will accompany you
I can tell you some lovely stories about the Duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You've already told me too much about it, sir,
they are true; if it wasn't true, none was enough.

LUCIO:
I was once in front of him for getting a girl pregnant.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Have you done such a thing?

LUCIO:
Yes, I got married, I did, but I had to give it up;
Otherwise, they would have married me to the rotten medlar tree.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, your business is more fair than honest. Rest well.

LUCIO:
On my promise, I will go with you to the end of the road:
if the debauched talk offends you, we will have very little
he. No, brother, I'm kind of a burr; I will stay.

ESCALUS:
Each letter he wrote rejected the others.

ANGELO:
In the most uneven and distracted way. His actions
show much like folly: pray to heaven that his wisdom be
not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
give back our authorities

ESCALUS:
I suppose not.

ANGELO:
And why should we proclaim it an hour before its
entering, that if anyone desires redress for an injustice,
should they take their petitions to the streets?

ESCALUS:
He explains the reason: having a dispatch from
complaints, and to issue us with devices
below, which will then have no power to maintain itself
against us.

ANGELO:
Well, I beg you, let it be proclaimed early
I am morning; I will call you at home: give
notice to men of sort and costume who must meet
him.

ESCALUS:
I will, sir. Be well.

ANGELO:
Good night.
This act completely distorts me, makes me not pregnant
And boring at all procedures. A deflowered servant!
And by an eminent body which imposed
The law against that! But it's her tender shame
Will not proclaim his first loss,
How could she talk to me! Yet reason dares to say no to him;
For my authority carries great credibility,
That no particular scandal can touch
But this confuses the prompter. He should have lived,
Save this turbulent youth, in a dangerous sense,
Perhaps in times to come we could have taken revenge,
By thus receiving a dishonored life
With a ransom of such shame. Would he still have lived!
A lack, when once our grace we have forgotten,
Nothing is right: we would, and we wouldn't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
These timely letters deliver me
The provost knows our goal and our plot.
As the matter is in progress, keep your instructions,
And always hold to our particular drift;
Even if sometimes you turn pale from this to that,
This is why the minister is taking action. Go call Flavius,
And tell him where I'm staying: give the same opinion
To Valentinus, Rowland and Crassus,
And tell them to bring the trumpets to the door;
But send me Flavius first.

BROTHER PIERRE:
We will have to speed up.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I thank you, Varrius; you hurried well:
Come, we will walk. There are other friends of ours
We will welcome you here shortly, my sweet Varrius.

ISABELLE:
Speaking so indirectly disgusts me:
I would tell the truth; but to accuse him thus,
It is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to obscure the point.

MARIANNE:
Be governed by him.

ISABELLE:
Besides, he told me that, if by chance
He speaks against me from the unfavorable side,
I shouldn't find this strange; because it's a question of physics
It's a bitter to sweet ending.

MARIANNE:
I would like Brother Peter...

ISABELLE:
O peace! the brother came.

BROTHER PIERRE:
Come on, I found the most suitable stand for you,
Where you can have such an advantage over the Duke,
He will not overtake you. Twice the trumpets have sounded;
The generous and most serious citizens
I walked through the doors, and very close
The Duke enters: so, go!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My very worthy cousin, well met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are happy to see you.

ANGELO:
Welcome back to your royal grace!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A big and warm thank you to you both.
We have carried out a survey of you; and we hear
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
I can only deliver you to public thanks,
Omen of more reprisals.

ANGELO:
You make my bonds even greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, your desert speaks loud; and I should be wrong,
To lock her in the protections of the secret breast,
When he deserves it, with brass characters,
A fortified residence “against the flow of time”
And the shaving of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And let the subject see, to let him know
That external courtesies would like to proclaim
Favors that stay inside. Come, Escalus,
You have to go through us to our other side;
And you are good supporters.

BROTHER PIERRE:
Now is your time: speak loudly and kneel before him.

ISABELLE:
Justice, oh royal duke! Vail your esteem
In case of wrong, I would have gladly said: a servant!
O worthy prince, do not dishonor your eye
By throwing it at any other object
Until you hear me in my true complaint
And gave me justice, justice, justice, justice!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Recount your wrongs; in that? By who? be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo who will do you justice:
Reveal yourself to him.

ISABELLE:
O worthy duke,
You command me to seek redemption from the devil:
Listen to me yourself; for what I need to talk about
You must either punish me, without being believed,
Or snatch repairs from you. Listen to me, oh listen to me, here!

ANGELO:
Monsignor, his spirit, I fear, is not firm:
She was my suitor for her brother
Cut off by justice,

ISABELLE:
Through justice!

ANGELO:
And she will speak very bitterly and strangely.

ISABELLE:
The strangest, but yet the truest, I would say:
This Angelo bet; isn't that strange?
This Angelo is a murderer; isn't that strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
A hypocrite, a rapist of virgins;
Isn't it strange and strange?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, it's ten times strange.

ISABELLE:
It's not true anymore, it's Angelo
So all this is as true as it is strange:
No, it's ten times true; because the truth is the truth
Until the end of the accounts.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Far from her! Poor soul,
She speaks thus in the infirmity of sense.

ISABELLE:
O prince, I conjure you, as you believe
There is another comfort than this world,
That you do not neglect me, with this opinion
How touched I am with madness! Don't make it impossible
What seems different: it's not impossible
But one, the baddest boss in the world,
Can appear as timid, as serious, as fair, as absolute
Like Angelo; even if Angelo can,
In all its dressings, characters, titles, forms,
Be a big bad guy; believe it, royal prince:
If it is less, it is nothing; but it is more,
If I had more name for evil.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By my honesty,
If she is crazy, like no other I believe,
His madness has the strangest meaning,
Such dependence from thing to thing,
As always I heard it in madness.

ISABELLE:
O gracious duke,
Don't dwell on it, and don't banish reason
For inequalities; but let your reason serve
To reveal the truth where it seems hidden,
And hiding the fake seems true.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many are not crazy
There is, of course, more lack of reason. What would you say?

ISABELLE:
I am the sister of a certain Claudio,
Convicted of fornication
Losing the mind; condemned by Angelo:
Me, on probation from a fraternity,
Was sent by my brother; a Lucio
As then the messenger,...

LUCIO:
It's me, and I don't resemble your grace:
I came to her from Claudio and I wanted her
To try his gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For the forgiveness of his poor brother.

ISABELLE:
It's him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You were not asked to speak.

LUCIO:
No, my good lord;
I didn't want to be silent either.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I wish it to you now, then;
Please take note of it: and when you have
A matter for you, pray to heaven for you then
To be perfect.

LUCIO:
I guarantee your honor.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Guarantees for yourself; take care.

ISABELLE:
This gentleman told a little of my story:

LUCIO:
RIGHT.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This may be true; but you are wrong
Speaking before time. Proceed.

ISABELLE:
I went
To this pernicious deputy-caitiff,...

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That's a bit crazy.

ISABELLE:
Excuse me ;
The expression is relevant.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Repaired again. The question; proceed.

ISABELLE:
In short, to define the unnecessary process,
How I persuaded, how I prayed and knelt,
How he felt about me and how I responded:
Because it was very long, the vile conclusion
I begin now with sorrow and shame to express:
He wouldn't, but thanks to the gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Free my brother; and, after much debate,
My fraternal remorse refutes my honor,
And I gave in to him: but the next morning it was time,
His goal is to overdo it, he sends a mandate
For my poor brother's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It's very likely !

ISABELLE:
Oh, how true it was!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By heaven, dear wretch, you don't know what you're talking about,
Or you are suborned against his honor
In a hateful practice. First, its integrity
Stands flawlessly. Then it doesn't matter for any reason
That with such vehemence he should pursue
Faults that are specific to him: if he had thus offended,
He would have weighed your brother by himself
And I didn't interrupt him. Someone said to you:
Admit the truth and tell by whose advice
You came here to complain.

ISABELLE:
And that's all ?
Then, O you ministers blessed on high,
Keep me in patience and with ripe time
Unfold the evil that is shrouded here
Ostensibly ! Heaven protects your grace from misfortune,
How wrong I was, so I am incredulous!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know you would like to leave. A policeman!
In prison with her! Should we therefore allow
A blast and a scandalous blast to die for
On him so close to us? This need must be a practice.
Who knew your intention and your coming here?

ISABELLE:
The one I wish was here, Brother Lodowick.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A ghostly father, no doubt. Who knows this Lodowick?

LUCIO:
Monsignor, I know him; he is an intrusive brother;
I don't like this man: if he had been secular, my lord
For certain words he spoke against your grace
In your retirement, I had balanced it well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Words against me? He’s a good brother, really!
And take on this miserable woman here
Against our replacement! May this brother be found.

LUCIO:
But last night, my lord, she and this brother,
I saw them at the prison: an impertinent monk,
A very scorbutic guy.

BROTHER PIERRE:
Blessed be your royal grace!
I stood there, my lord, and heard
Your royal ear abused. First, this woman
Wrongly accused your replacement,
Who is also free from contact or land with her
Like her from a not obtained.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We believed no less.
Do you know this brother Lodowick she speaks of?

BROTHER PIERRE:
I know him to be a divine and holy man;
Neither scurvy nor a temporary intruder,
As reported by this gentleman;
And, in my confidence, a man who has never before
He has, as he guarantees, made a false statement about your Grace.

LUCIO:
Monsignor, in the most villainous manner; believe it.

BROTHER PIERRE:
Well, in time he may be able to justify himself;
But right now my lord is ill,
A strange fever. At his simple request,
Having learned that there was a complaint
Destined to fight Lord Angelo, I came here,
To say, as if from his own mouth, what he knows
Is true and false; and what's wrong with his oath
And all probation will be perfectly clear,
Every time he is summoned. First for this woman.
To justify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and personally accused,
You will hear it refuted in his eyes,
Until she admitted it herself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good brother, let's listen to him.
Don't you smile at that, Lord Angelo?
O heaven, vanity of miserable fools!
Give us seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I will be impartial; be you judge
From your own cause. Is this the witness, brother?
Let her show her face first, then speak.

MARIANNE:
Pardon, my lord; I won't show my face
Until my husband suggested it to me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, are you married?

MARIANNE:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are you a housekeeper?

MARIANNE:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A widow, then?

MARIANNE:
Neither, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, then, you are nothing: neither servant, nor widow, nor wife?

LUCIO:
My lord, she may be a punk; because many of them are
neither servant, nor widow, nor wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Shut this guy up: I wish he had a reason
Chatting to himself.

LUCIO:
Well, my lord.

MARIANNE:
My lord; I admit that I have never been married;
And I admit, moreover, that I am not a servant:
I knew my husband; yet my husband
He doesn't know he ever knew me.

LUCIO:
He was drunk then, my lord: it couldn't be better.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For the benefit of silence, would you be too!

LUCIO:
Well, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He's not a witness for Lord Angelo.

MARIANNE:
Now I come to my lord
The one who accuses him of fornication,
In the same way I accuse my husband,
And charge him my lord, with such weather
When I dropped off, I had him in my arms
With all the effect of love.

ANGELO:
She charges more than me?

MARIANNE:
Not that I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say your husband.

MARIANNE:
Well, my lord, and this is Angelo,
Who thinks he knows he never knew my body,
But he knows that he thinks he knows Isabel's.

ANGELO:
It's a strange abuse. Let's see your face.

MARIANNE:
My husband gives it to me; now I will unmask.
It's this face, cruel Angelo,
What you once swore was worth the detour;
It is the hand which, with a doomed contract,
Was quickly locked in yours; it's the body
This took the match away from Isabel,
And I provided you in your garden house
In his imagined person.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you know this woman?

LUCIO:
Carnally, she said.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, no more!

LUCIO:
Enough, my lord.

ANGELO:
My lord, I must admit that I know this woman:
And five years since we haven't talked about marriage
Between me and her; which was broken,
Partly for this, its promised proportions
Lack of composition, but in chief
For this, his reputation was devalued
In lightness: for what period of five years
I never spoke to her, I never saw her, nor heard of her,
On my faith and my honor.

MARIANNE:
Noble prince,
As light comes from heaven and words from breath,
As there is meaning in truth and truth in virtue,
I am also heavily engaged to this man's wife
As words could constitute wishes: and, my good lord,
But on Tuesday evening I entered the garden house
He knew me as a wife. How true it is,
Let me rise safely from my knees
Or be forever confined here,
A marble monument!

ANGELO:
I've only smiled so far:
Now, good my lord, give me the extent of justice
My patience here is touched. I perceive
These poor informal women are no longer
But the instruments of a more powerful member
This excites them: let me pass, my lord,
To discover this practice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Yes, with my heart
And punish them to your heart's content.
You, foolish brother, and pernicious woman,
Pact with her who left, do you think about your oaths,
Although they would swear to each particular saint,
Was there any testimony against his worth and credit
Is it sealed with approval? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind sorrows
To discover this abuse, where it derives from.
There is another brother who started them;
Let's bring him in.

BROTHER PIERRE:
Would he be there, my lord! because he in fact
He put the women on this complaint:
Your provost knows where he resides
And he can get it back.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go do it instantly.
And you, my noble and well-deserved cousin,
Whose it is to hear this matter,
Do with your wounds what seems best to you,
In all punishment: I will leave you for a moment;
But don't move until you've decided
On these slanderers.

ESCALUS:
Monsignor, we will do it until the end.
Signor Lucio, didn't you say you knew
Is Brother Lodowick a dishonest person?

LUCIO:
'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
but in his clothes; and the one who spoke the most
infamous speeches of the Duke.

ESCALUS:
We will beg you to stay here until he comes and
oppose them to him: we will find this brother a
a remarkable man.

LUCIO:
Like anyone else in Vienna, well.

ESCALUS:
Call this same Isabel here again; I would talk to him.
Please, my lord, grant me permission to ask questions; You
I will see how I will manage it.

LUCIO:
No better than him, according to his own report.

ESCALUS:
You say?

LUCIO:
Get married, sir, I think if you treated her privately,
she would prefer to admit: perhaps, publicly,
she will be ashamed.

ESCALUS:
I will go into the darkness to work with her.

LUCIO:
This is how ; for women are light at midnight.

ESCALUS:
Come on, mistress: here is a nice lady who denies everything
that you said.

LUCIO:
My lord, here is the rascal I spoke of; attached
the provost.

ESCALUS:
In very good times: don't talk to him until we
call on you.

LUCIO:
Mom.

ESCALUS:
Come, sir: have you incited these women to slander
Lord Angelo? They admitted that you did it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It's wrong.

ESCALUS:
How! do you know where you are?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Respect to your great place! and let the devil
One day be honored for his fiery throne!
Where is the Duke? he should hear me speak.

ESCALUS:
The Duke is in us; and we will hear you speak:
Listen, you're talking exactly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Audaciously, at least. But, oh poor souls,
Are you coming here to get the fox's lamb?
Good night to your resort! Has the Duke left?
Then your cause will also disappear. The duke is unjust,
So to respond to your manifest call,
And put your lawsuit in the mouth of the wicked
What you come here to accuse.

LUCIO:
He's the rascal; It’s him I spoke about.

ESCALUS:
Well, you, irreverent and impious brother,
Isn't it enough that you suborned these women
Accusing this worthy man, but, in a foul mouth
And according to the testimony of his right ear,
Call him bad? and then glance away from him
To the duke himself, to accuse him of injustice?
Take him from here; at the stand with him! We will use you
Joint by joint, but we will know its purpose.
How “unfair”!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Don't be so hot; the Duke
Don't you dare hold out my finger more than him
Dare to blame himself: I am not his subject,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
I made myself a spectator here in Vienna,
Where I saw corruption boil and bubble
Until the stew boils over; laws for all faults,
But the faults were so well tolerated that the strong statuses
Stand like the packages in a hair salon,
As much in mockery as in brand.

ESCALUS:
Slander to the State! Take him to jail!

ANGELO:
What can you blame him for, Signor Lucio?
Is this the man you told us about?

LUCIO:
It's him, my lord. Come here, brave bald man:
do you know me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
I met you at the prison, in the Duke's absence.

LUCIO:
Oh that's right ? And do you remember what you said about the Duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Above all, sir.

LUCIO:
Really, sir? And was the Duke a meat merchant, a
insane and cowardly, as you then denounced?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You must, sir, change persons with me, before making
as my report: you spoke of it well; And
much more, much worse.

LUCIO:
O cursed boy! Did I not tear you away by the
nose for your speeches?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I protest that I love the Duke as I love myself.

ANGELO:
Listen, how would the wicked man shut up now, after his
abuse of treason!

ESCALUS:
We must not speak of such an individual. Far from
him in prison! Where is the provost? Far from him
in prison! put enough locks on him: let him
do not speak anymore. No more giglots too, and
with the other fellow Confederate!

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
What, is he resisting? Help him, Lucio.

LUCIO:
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; phew, sir! Why you
Baldness, you rascal liar, you must be hooded, you must
You ? Show your naughty face, with a pox for you!
show your sheep-biting face and be hanged for an hour!
Won't go out?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are the first rascal who ever made a duke.
First of all, Provost, let me release these three nice men.
Don't sneak around, sir; for the brother and you
You need to talk to me right away. Hold it.

LUCIO:
It could turn out to be worse than hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
O my fearsome lord,
I should be more guilty than my guilt,
To think that I can be indistinguishable,
When I perceive your grace, like divine power,
I looked at my passes. So, good prince,
I no longer have a session on my shame,
But let my trial be my own confession:
Immediate conviction then subsequent death
This is all the grace I ask for.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come here, Mariana.
Say, have you ever been contracted with this woman?

ANGELO:
I was, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go and take her away from here and marry her at once.
Do your duty, brother; who consumes,
Bring it back here again. Go with him, provost.

ESCALUS:
My lord, I am even more surprised at his dishonor
Than in the face of the strangeness of the situation.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come here, Isabel.
Your brother is now your prince: as I was then
Advertising and sacred for your business,
I don't change my mind with habit, I always do
Lawyer at your service.

ISABELLE:
Oh, forgive me,
That I, your vassal, have used and suffered
Your unknown sovereignty!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pardoned, Isabelle:
And now, dear girl, be free towards us too.
The death of your brother, I know, is close to your heart;
And you might wonder why I got dark,
Working to save his life, and would rather not
Make a rash remonstration about my hidden power
Than let it go to waste. O very kind servant,
It was the rapid celerity of his death,
What I thought with a slower foot has happened,
That has been my goal. But peace be with him!
This life is a better life, beyond the fear of death,
That which lives in fear: make it your comfort,
So happy is your brother.

ISABELLE:
Yes my Lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For this newlywed who approaches here,
Whose salty imagination has done more harm
Your honor well defended, you must forgive
For Mariana's sake: but as he judged your brother:
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacred chastity and breaking promises
This is where your brother's life depends...
The very mercy of the law cries out
Very audible, even in one's own language,
“An Angelo for Claudio, dead for dead!”
Haste always pays for haste, and leisure responds to leisure;
Like leaves like, and always MEASURE FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, your fault is thus manifested;
Which, as much as you want to deny it, deprives you of the advantage.
We condemn you to the very block
Where Claudio leaned towards death, and with the same haste.
Far from him !

MARIANNE:
O my most gracious lord,
I hope you won't make fun of me with a husband.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It was your husband who made fun of you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honor,
I thought your marriage was suitable; otherwise imputation,
For that he knew you, could blame your life
And stifle your good to come; for his property,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We establish you and widow you at the same time,
To buy you a better husband.

MARIANNE:
O my dear lord,
I don't want any other, nor any better man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Never want him; we are final.

MARIANNE:
Sweet my lord,...

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do it, but you lose your job.
Far from him until death!
Now, sir, over to you.

MARIANNE:
O my good lord! Sweet Isabelle, take my side;
Lend me your knees and all my life to come
I will lend you my whole life to be of service to you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Against all sense, you bother him:
Should she kneel in pity for this fact,
The ghost of his brother, his cobbled bed would break,
And take her away from here with horror.

MARIANNE:
Isabelle,
Sweet Isabelle, kneel beside me;
Raise your hands, don't say anything; I will talk about everything.
It is said that the best men are made from flaws;
And, for the most part, become the more, the better.
To be a little bad: my husband too.
O Isabelle, won't you lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He dies for Claudio's death.

ISABELLE:
Very generous sir,
Please look at this condemned man,
As if my brother lived: I think in part
Due sincerity governed his actions,
Until he looks at me: since it is so,
Don't let him die. My brother only had justice,
In this he did the thing for which he died:
For Angelo,
His act did not exceed his evil intention,
And must be buried but as intention
This has also perished: thoughts are not subjects;
Intentions but simply thoughts.

MARIANNE:
Simply, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your lawsuit is not profitable; get up, I said.
I remembered another flaw.
Provost, how come Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

Provost:
It was ordered like this.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you have a special mandate for this act?

Provost:
No, my good lord; it was by private message.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which I relieve you of your duties:
Give up your keys.

Provost:
Forgive me, noble lord:
I thought it was a mistake, but I didn't know it;
Yet I repented, after further counsel;
In testimony of which, one in the prison,
Who should have died on private orders,
I booked alive.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It?

Provost:
His name is Barnardine.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I wish you had done it by Claudio.
Go get it here; let me look at it.

ESCALUS:
I'm sorry, someone so erudite and wise
As you, Lord Angelo, appeared again,
Should slide so roughly, so much in the heat of blood.
And a lack of judgment subsequently tempered.

ANGELO:
I'm sorry I felt such grief:
And it sinks so deep into my penitent heart
That I want to die more than to have mercy;
It is my merit, and I implore it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is this Barnardine?

Provost:
This, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A brother told me about this man.
Sirrah, they say you have a stubborn soul.
It does not apprehend further than this world,
And rule your life accordingly. You are condemned:
But, for these earthly faults, I abandon them all;
And I pray you, take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Brother, advise him;
I leave it in your hands. What choked guy is this?

Provost:
It's another prisoner I saved.
Who should have died when Claudio lost his mind?
Almost as much for Claudio as for himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

LUCIO:
“My goodness, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
trick. If you want to hang me for that, you can; but I
I wish you liked it, I could be whipped.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whipped first, sir, and hanged afterwards.
Proclaim him, provost, throughout the city.
Did any woman wrong this lewd man,
As I heard swear there is one
The one he has generated, let her appear,
And he will marry her: the wedding is over,
Let him be whipped and hanged.

LUCIO:
Please don't marry me to a whore.
Your Highness said even now, I have made you duke:
good monsignor, do not reward me by making me a cuckold.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
On my honor, you will marry him.
I forgive your slanders; and with that
Return your other packages. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure here executed.

LUCIO:
To marry a punk, my lord, is to squeeze to death,
whip and hang.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Slandering a prince deserves it.
She, Claudio, whom you have wronged, watch her restored.
Joy to you, Mariana! I love him, Angelo:
I have confessed it and I know its virtue.
Thank you, good friend Escalus, for your kindness:
There is more behind it that is more congratulatory.
Thank you, provost, for your care and your secrecy:
We will employ you in a more dignified place.
Forgive him, Angelo, it brought you home
Ragozine's chef for Claudio:
The offense is forgiven. Dear Isabelle,
I have a motion which is very important for your good;
Where to go if you will inclined your ear,
What is mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
Then take us to our palace; where we will show
What's still behind it is what you all should know.

SLY:
I will call you, in faith.

Hostess:
A pair of sticks, you thug!

SLY:
You are baggage: the Slys are not knaves; look in
chronic ; we arrived with Richard Conqueror.
So paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!

Hostess:
You won't pay for the glasses you broke?

SLY:
No, not a Holocaust denier. Pass, Jeronymy: go towards your cold
read and warm up.

Hostess:
I know my remedy; I have to go get the
third--district.

SLY:
Third, or fourth, or fifth district, I will answer him
by the law: I will not move an inch, my boy: let him come,
and kindly.

Lord:
Hunter, I command you, tend my dogs well:
Brach Merriman, the poor dog is in relief;
And pair Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach.
Haven't you seen, boy, how Silver made it good
At the corner of the hedge, in the coldest crack?
I wouldn't lose the dog for twenty pounds.

First hunter:
Well, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
He cried over it at the slightest loss
And twice today I chose the blandest smell:
Believe me, I think he's the best dog.

Lord:
You are an imbecile: if Echo were that fast,
I would estimate it to be worth a dozen.
But eat them well and look at them all:
Tomorrow I plan to hunt again.

First hunter:
I will, my lord.

Lord:
What's here? a dead man or a drunk? See, is he breathing?

Second hunter:
He is breathing, my lord. If it hadn't been warmed with beer,
It was a bed but cold for sleeping so soundly.

Lord:
O monstrous beast! how he lies like a pig!
Grim death, how loathsome and loathsome is your image!
Gentlemen, I'm going to practice on this drunk man.
What do you think, if he was taken to bed,
Wrapped in pretty clothes, rings put on his fingers,
A most delicious banquet near his bed,
And brave servants near him when he wakes,
Wouldn't the beggar forget himself?

First hunter:
Believe me, lord, I don't think he can choose.

Second hunter:
It would seem strange to him when he woke up.

Lord:
Even as a flattering dream or a worthless fantasy.
So take it and handle the joke:
Carry it gently to my most beautiful room
And hang it with all my free photos:
Balm his foul head in lukewarm distilled water
And burn sweet wood to make the shelter sweet:
Get me some music ready for when he wakes up,
To make a sweet and heavenly sound;
And if he gets the chance to speak, be ready
And with a faint submissive reverence
Say: What will your honor command? »
Let us accompany him with a basin of silver
Full of rose water and strewn with flowers,
Another carries the ewer, the third a diaper,
And say: “Would your lordship not like to refresh your hands?”
Someone be ready with an expensive suit
And ask him what garment he will wear;
Another tells him about his dogs and his horse,
And let his lady mourn her illness:
Persuade him that he was crazy;
And when he says he is, say he's dreaming,
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
Do it and do it kindly, gentlemen:
It will be a great pastime,
If it is handled modestly.

First hunter:
My lord, I guarantee you that we will play our part,
As he will think by our true diligence
It is nothing less than what we say.

Lord:
Take him gently and lie down with him;
And everyone at their desk when they wake up.
Sirrah, go see what trumpet sounds:
For example, a noble gentleman who means,
Take a trip to rest him here.
How now! who is it?

Servant:
Do not disgrace your honor, players
This provides a service to your lordship.

Lord:
Tell them to come closer.
Now, friends, you are welcome.

Players:
We thank your honor.

Lord:
Do you plan to stay with me tonight?

A player:
So please, Your Lordship accept our duty.

Lord:
With all my heart. This guy I remember,
Since then, he played the role of a farmer's eldest son:
This is where you wooed this lady so well:
I forgot your name; but of course this part
Was well fitted and naturally executed.

A player:
I think Soto is what your honor means.

Lord:
It's very true: you did it very well.
Well, you came to me in a happy moment;
Especially since I have sport in hand
How your trick can help me a lot.
There is a lord who will hear you play tonight:
But I doubt your modesty;
For fear of overlooking his strange behavior,...
Because yet his honor has never heard a play...
You enter into joyful passion
And thus offend him; because I tell you, gentlemen,
If you smile, he gets impatient.

A player:
Do not fear, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
Was he the world's most jester?

Lord:
Come on, sir, take them to the butter,
And welcome them all amicably:
That they don't want anything my house offers them.
Sirrah, go to my page Barthol'mew,
And see him dressed in all the costumes like a lady:
This done, take him to the drunkard's room;
And call her “ma’am,” pay her respects.
Tell him for me, for he will win my love,
He behaves with honorable action,
As he observed among noble ladies
To their lords, by them accomplished:
Such duty to the drunkard lets him do it
With a soft, low tongue and humble courtesy,
And say "What will your honor command,
Where your lady and your humble wife
Can she show her duty and make her love known?
And then with kind embraces, tempting kisses,
And with his head bowed in his bosom,
Tell him to shed tears, as if he were delighted
To see his noble lord regain health,
Who during these seven years esteemed him
No better than a poor and disgusting beggar:
And if the boy doesn't have a woman's gift
To rain down a rain of commanded tears,
An onion will do well for such a change,
What in a nearby napkin was transmitted
Must despite applying a tear.
See this dispatched with all the haste you can:
Soon I will give you more instructions.
I know the boy will usurp grace,
Voice, walk and action of a nice woman:
I can't wait to hear her call the husband a drunk,
And how my men will keep from laughing
When they pay homage to this simple peasant.
I will come to advise them; maybe my presence
Could well soothe the overly happy spleen
Which would otherwise turn into extremes.

SLY:
For God's sake, a pot of small beer.

First Servant:
Would your lordship not like to drink a cup of sack?

Second servant:
Will your honor not like these preserves?

Third servant:
What clothing will your honor wear today?

SLY:
My name is Christophero Sly; don't call me "honor" or
“Lordship: “I never drank a sack in my life; and if
you give me canned food, give me canned food
beef: never ask me what clothes I will wear; In my opinion
I have no more doublets than my back, no more stockings
only the legs, nor more shoes than feet; No,
sometimes more feet than shoes, or shoes like mine
toes peek through leather.

Lord:
God, cease this vain mood in your honor!
Oh, that a mighty man of such descent,
Such goods and such high esteem,
Should be imbued with such a foul spirit!

SLY:
What, would you drive me crazy? Aren't I Christopher
Sly, the son of old Sly of Burtonheath, born one
peddler, by education a cartier, by transmutation a
herd of bears, and now, by current profession, handyman?
Ask Marian Hacket, the big Wincot saleswoman, if
she doesn't know me: if she says I'm not fourteen pence
on the score for the neat beer, score me for the
the biggest liar in Christendom. What! I'm not
panicked: here is...

Third servant:
Oh, that's what makes your lady cry!

Second servant:
O, this is what brings down your servants!

Lord:
This is why your family is fleeing your home,
As if beaten by your strange madness.
O noble lord, remember your birth,
Bring home your old thoughts of banishment
And therefore banish these abject and humble dreams.
See how your servants care for you,
Everyone in their office, listening to you.
Do you want music? listen ! Apollo plays,
And twenty caged nightingales sing:
Where are you going to sleep? we will take you to a sofa
Softer and gentler than the lustful bed
Specially designed for Sémiramis.
Say you want to walk; we will sow the land:
Or do you want to ride a horse? your horses will be trapped,
Their harness was all studded with gold and pearls.
Do you like hawking? you have hawks that will fly away
Above the morning lark or do you want to chase?
Your dogs will force the Welkins to answer them
And collect the sharp echoes of the hollow earth.

First Servant:
Say you're willing to do it; your greyhounds are also fast
As the deer breathes, yes, faster than the roe deer.

Second servant:
Do you like the images? we will pick you up directly
Adonis painted by a flowing stream,
And Cytherea, all hidden in the sedges,
Who seem to move and wanton with his breath,
Even if the undulating sedges play with the wind.

Lord:
We will show you Io as she was a servant,
And as she was seduced and surprised,
As vividly painted as the deed was accomplished.

Third servant:
Or Daphne wandering in a thorny wood,
Scratching your legs so you swear it's bleeding,
And at this sight the sad Apollo will cry,
So that blood and tears flow.

Lord:
You are a lord, and nothing but a lord:
You have a much more beautiful lady
Than any woman in this declining era.

First Servant:
And even the tears she shed for you
As envious waves invade her pretty face,
She was the most beautiful creature in the world;
And yet, she is not inferior to anyone.

SLY:
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
Or am I dreaming? or have I been dreaming until now?
I don't sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
I smell sweet flavors and I smell sweet things:
Over my life I am truly a lord
And not a handyman or Christophero Sly.
Well, bring our lady here before our eyes;
And again, a pot of the smallest beer.

Second servant:
Would it not please your power to wash your hands?
Oh, how happy we are to see your spirit restored!
Oh, that once again you knew what you are!
These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
Or when you wake up, you wake up as if you were sleeping.

SLY:
These fifteen years! by my fay, a good nap.
But have I never talked about it all this time?

First Servant:
O, yes, my lord, but very vain words:
For although you lie here in this beautiful room,
Yet, would you say that you were beaten at the door;
And insult the hostess of the house;
And say you would introduce her to the leet,
Because she brought stone jugs and not sealed liters:
Sometimes you called Cicely Hacket.

SLY:
Yes, the maid of the house.

Third servant:
Well, sir, you know neither house nor servant of this kind,
Nor any of the men such as you have numbered,
Like Stephen Sly and John Naps from Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And twenty other names and men like these
Which has never been the case and which no man has ever seen.

SLY:
Now, Lord, be thanked for my good amends!

ALL:
Amen.

SLY:
I thank you: you won't lose.

Page:
How is my noble lord?

SLY:
Get married, I'm doing well because there's enough joy here.
Where is my wife?

Page:
Here, noble lord: what is your will with her?

SLY:
Are you my wife and you will not call me husband?
My men should call me “lord”: I am your good man.

Page:
My husband and my lord, my lord and my husband;
I am your wife in all obedience.

SLY:
I know it well. What should I call it?

Lord:
Madam.

SLY:
Al'ce ma'am, or Joan ma'am?

Lord:
“Madame”, and nothing else: then, gentlemen
call the ladies.

SLY:
Madam my wife, they say that I dreamed
And I slept for over fifteen years or more.

Page:
Yes, and it seems to me that it is thirty o'clock,
Being abandoned from your bed all this time.

SLY:
It's a lot. Servants, leave me and her alone.
Madam, undress and now come to bed.

Page:
Thrice noble lord, let me implore you
To forgive me for another night or two,
Or, otherwise, until sunset:
Because your doctors have expressly instructed,
In danger of contracting your old disease,
That I should still be absent from your bed:
I hope this reason is worth my excuse.

SLY:
Yes, it is so that I can hardly
wait so long. But I would be reluctant to fall into
my dreams again: so I will linger
despite flesh and blood.

Messenger:
Your Honor's players, warming up your amendment,
Have come to play a pleasant comedy;
This is why your doctors consider it very satisfactory,
Seeing too much sadness has frozen your blood,
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
That's why they thought it was good to hear a play
And prepare your mind for mirth and mirth,
Which prohibits a thousand evils and prolongs life.

SLY:
Get married, I will, let them play. Is not a
Comondy, a Christmas frolic or a tumble ride?

Page:
No, my good lord; it's a more pleasant thing.

SLY:
What, cleaning stuff?

Page:
It's kind of a story.

SLY:
Well, well, you see. Come, lady, sit by my side
and let the world slide: we will never be younger.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, because for the great desire that I had
To see Padua fair, incubator of the arts,
I have arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy;
And by my father's love and departure, I am armed
With his good will and your good company,
My faithful servant, well approved in all,
Here, let's breathe and perhaps establish ourselves
A journey of learning and ingenious study.
Pisa is renowned for its serious citizens
Gave me my being and my father first,
A merchant with large traffic across the world,
Vincetino comes from Bentivolii.
Vincetino's son grew up in Florence
He will become at the service of all the hopes conceived,
To adorn his fortune with his virtuous acts:
And so, Tranio, during the time I study,
Virtue and this part of philosophy
Will I apply this treat of happiness
Under specially to achieve.
Tell me what you think; because I still have Pisa
And I come to Padua, like one who leaves
A little push to plunge him into the depths
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

TRANIO:
Mi perdonato, sweet master of mine,
I am affected in everything like you;
Glad you maintain your determination
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we admire
This virtue and this moral discipline,
Let us neither be stoic nor stock up, I pray;
Or devote yourself to Aristotle's checks
As Ovid was a completely abjured pariah:
Refuse logic with knowledge you have
And practice rhetoric in your common speech;
Music and poetry are used to invigorate you;
Mathematics and metaphysics,
Fall towards them when you find that your stomach serves you;
No profit grows where there is no pleasure:
In short, sir, study what affects you most.

LUCENTIO:
Thank you, Tranio, you advise me well.
If, Biondello, you came ashore,
We could immediately prepare,
And take accommodation worthy of receiving
Such friends as time spent in Padua will engender.
But wait a minute: what company is this?

TRANIO:
Master, a show to welcome us to town.

BAPTIST:
Gentlemen, don't bother me any further,
You know how firmly I am resolved;
In other words, I will not give my youngest daughter
Before having a husband for the eldest:
If either of you likes Katharina,
Because I know you well and I like you,
Leave, you will have to court him as you wish.

GRÉMIO:

CATHERINE:
I pray you, sir, is this your will
Make a fool of myself among these friends?

HORTENSIO:
My friends, good! what do you mean ? no friends for you,
Unless you are of a milder mold.

CATHERINE:
My goodness, sir, you will never have to fear:
I think that's not half the way to his heart;
But if that were the case, there is no doubt that his care would have to be
To comb your head with a three-legged stool
And paint your face and use yourself like a fool.

HYDRANGE:
From all these demons, good Lord, deliver us!

GRÉMIO:
And me too, damn it!

TRANIO:
Hush, master! here is a good hobby for:
This girl is completely crazy or wonderfully rebellious.

LUCENTIO:
But in the silence of the other do I see
Gentle and sober behavior of the maid.
Peace, Tranio!

TRANIO:
Well said, master; Mom! and contemplate to your heart’s content.

BAPTIST:
Gentlemen, so that I can soon repair
What I said, Bianca, bring in:
And don't let it displease you, good Bianca,
Because I won't love you any less, my daughter.

CATHERINE:
A pretty peat! it's better
Stick a finger in her eye, and she knew why.

BIANCA:
My sister, be content with my discontent.
Sir, for your pleasure I humbly subscribe:
My books and my instruments will be my company,
On them to take and practice on my own.

LUCENTIO:
Listen, Tranio! you can hear Minerva speaking.

HORTENSIO:
Signor Baptista, will you be so strange?
I am sorry that our goodwill effects
Bianca's grief.

GRÉMIO:
Why are you going to meow at her,
Lord Baptista, for this demon from hell,
And make him bear the penance of his tongue?

BAPTIST:
Gentlemen, be content; I am resolved:
Come in, Bianca:
And because I know she has the most fun
In music, instruments and poetry,
I will keep schoolmasters in my house,
Apt to educate his youth. If you, Hortensio,
Or Signor Gremio, you know some,
Prefer them here; for cunning men
I will be very kind and liberal
For my own well-behaved children:
And so goodbye. Katharina, you can stay;
Because I have more to commune with Bianca.

CATHERINE:
Why, and I hope I can go too, right? What,
should I be set hours; as if, it seems, I
I didn't know what to take and what to leave, ha?

GRÉMIO:
You can go to the mother of the devil: your gifts are so
Well, here, no one will hold you back. Their love is not
It's great, Hortensio, but we can blow our nails
together, and quickly spread: our cakes dough on
on both sides. Farewell: yet for the love that I carry my
sweet Bianca, if I can somehow find a fit
man to teach him what he pleases, I will
wishes it to his father.

HORTENSIO:
Me too, Signor Gremio: but a word, please.
Although the nature of our feud was never tolerated
speak, know now, on advice, it affects us both,
so that we can once again have access to our fair
mistress and be happy rivals in the love of Bianco, for
work and do something specially.

GRÉMIO:
What is this, I pray?

HORTENSIO:
Get married, sir, to find a husband for her sister.

GRÉMIO:
A husband! A devil.

HORTENSIO:
I say, a husband.

GRÉMIO:
I say, a devil. But you think, Hortensio,
his father is very rich, every man is so stupid
to be married to hell?

HORTENSIO:
Tush, Gremio, even if it exceeds your patience and mine
to put up with his loud alarms, well, man, there will be some good
people in the world, a man could discover them,
would take it with all the faults and enough money.

GRÉMIO:
I can not tell; but I was convinced to take her dowry with
this condition, to be whipped to the high cross
every morning.

HORTENSIO:
Faith, as you say, there are few choices in rotten
apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
friends, it will be so friendly
everything maintained by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
to a husband we release his youngest man for a husband,
and then I don't have to get a new one. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
be his unemployed person! Whoever runs the fastest gets the ring.
What do you say, Signor Gremio?

GRÉMIO:
I agree; and would I have given him the best
horse to Padua to begin his courting which
court her thoroughly, marry her, bed her and dump her
house of her! Come on.

TRANIO:
Please, sir, tell me, is it possible
Should this love suddenly take such a hold?

LUCENTIO:
O Tranio, until I find it true,
I never thought this was possible or probable;
But see, while I watched and did nothing,
I found the effect of love in idleness:
And now confess clearly,
This is as secret and as dear to me
Like Anna for the queen of Carthage,
Tranio, I burn, I languish, I perish, Tranio,
If I don't reach this modest girl.
Advise me, Tranio, for I know you can;
Help me, Tranio, because I know you will.

TRANIO:
Master, now is not the time to scold you;
Affection is not evaluated with the heart:
If love has touched you, all that remains is like this,
“Redime te captum quam queas minimo.”

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, my boy, move forward; this content:
The rest will console you, thanks to the solidity of your advice.

TRANIO:
Master, you have looked at the servant for so long,
Perhaps you haven't noticed what the real meaning of all this is.

LUCENTIO:
Oh yes, I saw a sweet beauty in her face,
As had Agenor's daughter,
This made Jupiter great to humiliate him in his hands.
When, on his knees, he kissed the Cretan beach.

TRANIO:
Haven't you seen each other anymore? haven't you noticed how her sister
I started to rumble and raise such a storm
That mortal ears could hardly bear the din?

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, I saw her coral lips move
And with her breath she perfumed the air:
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.

TRANIO:
No, then it's time to snap him out of his trance.
Please wake up, sir: if you love the maid,
Bend your thoughts and your intelligence to achieve this. So it is:
Her older sister is so naughty and crafty
Until the father gets rid of her,
Master, your love must live like a servant at home;
And that's why he meowed at her closely,
Because she won't be bothered by suitors.

LUCENTIO:
Ah! Tranio, what a cruel father he is!
But you are not advised, he took some precautions
For his cunning schoolmasters to instruct him?

TRANIO:
Yes, I am getting married, sir; and now it's plotted.

LUCENTIO:
I have it, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Master, for my hand,
Our two inventions meet and merge into one.

LUCENTIO:
Tell me yours first.

TRANIO:
You will be a schoolmaster
And undertake the teaching of the servant:
It's your device.

LUCENTIO:
It is: is it possible?

TRANIO:
Not possible; for who will bear your share,
And be in Padua here the son of Vincentio,
Keeping house and reading your book, welcoming your friends,
Visit your compatriots and banquet them?

LUCENTIO:
Basta; be happy, because I have it full.
We haven't been seen in any house yet,
We can't tell each other apart by our faces either
For man or master; then it follows thus;
You will be master, Tranio, in my place,
Keep the house, the port and the servants as I should:
I will be another, a Florentine,
A Neapolitan or a meaner man from Pisa.
"It is hatched and it will be like this: Tranio, immediately
Unpack yourself; take my colorful hat and coat:
When Biondello arrives, he serves you;
But first I'll charm him into keeping his tongue.

TRANIO:
So, you needed it.
In short, sir, if it is your pleasure,
And I am required to be obedient;
For this is what your father commanded me when we separated,
“Be useful to my son,” he said,
Although I think it was in another sense;
I'm happy to be Lucentio,
Because I love Lucentio so much.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be it, because Lucentio likes:
And let me be a slave to reach this maid
Whose sudden sight captivated my wounded eye.
Here is the thug.
Sirrah, where have you been?

BIONDELLO:
Where was I! No, how now! where are you ?
Master, did my comrade Tranio steal your clothes? Or
did you steal his? or both? Please, what's the news?

LUCENTIO:
Sirrah, come here: this is not the time to joke,
And so fit your manners with the times.
Your comrade Tranio here, to save my life,
Put on my clothes and my face,
And I, to escape, I put on his;
'Cause I've been arguing since I came ashore
I killed a man and I'm afraid of being discovered:
Wait on him, I charge you, as is fitting,
As I run away from here for my life:
You understand me?

BIONDELLO:
Me, sir! never at all.

LUCENTIO:
And not a word from Tranio in your mouth:
Tranio changes into Lucentio.

BIONDELLO:
Good for him: I would be too!

TRANIO:
So could I, my goodness, my boy, have the next wish after,
This Lucentio did have Baptista's youngest daughter.
But, sir, not for me, but for your master, I advise you
You exercise discretion in all kinds of businesses:
When I'm alone, well, then I'm Tranio;
But everywhere else, your master Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, let's go: there is still one thing left, and that is
do it yourself, to make one of these suitors: if
you ask me why, that's enough, my reasons are both good
and heavy.

First Servant:
Monsignor, you nod your head; you don't mind the room.

SLY:
Yes, by Saint Anne, isn't it? It's a good deal, surely:
are there still any?

Page:
My lord, this has only just begun.

SLY:
It's a very excellent job, ma'am:
would it be done!

PETRUCHIO:
Verona, I take leave for a moment,
To see my friends in Padua, but above all
My beloved and approved best friend,
Hortensio; and I think it's his house.
Here, Mr. Grumio; knock, I said.

GRUMIO:
Strike, sir! Who should I hit? does the man have
have you refused your worship?

PETRUCHIO:
Wicked, I said, hit me here deep.

GRUMIO:
Hit yourself here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, what
Should I hit you here, sir?

PETRUCHIO:
Bad guy, I say, hit me at this door
And hit me good, or I'll hit your rascal's pie.

GRUMIO:
My master has become quarrelsome. I should knock
you first,
And then I know who comes worst.

PETRUCHIO:
Won't it be?
Well, sir, if you don't knock, I will ring;
I'm going to try how you can G, F and chant.

GRUMIO:
Help, masters, help! my master is crazy.

PETRUCHIO:
Now strike when I tell you, you wicked sir!

HORTENSIO:
How now! What is the problem? My old friend Grumio!
and my good friend Petruchio! How are you in Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Signor Hortensio, have you come to separate the fray?
“Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,” I can say.

HORTENSIO:
'Alla nostra casa benvenuto, signor molto honorato
mio Petruchio. Get up, Grumio, get up: we will compose
this quarrel.

GRUMIO:
No, it doesn't matter, sir, what he says in Latin.
if it's not a legitimate case for me to leave her
service, look, sir, he asked me to hit him and rap
well, sir: well, was it proper that a servant
uses his master thus, being perhaps, as far as I see,
thirty-two hours, a pip out? Who would want me to have God
Initially well hit, Grumio had not experienced the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
A foolish villain! Good Hortensio,
I asked the rascal to knock on your door
And I couldn't convince him, because of my heart, to do it.

GRUMIO:
Knock at the door ! O heaven! I didn't tell you that
clear words: 'Sirrah, hit me here, hit me here,
hit me good and hit me hard'? And come you
now with “knocking on the door”?

PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah, leave or don't speak, I advise you.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
Well, it's a great chance between him and you,
Your old, faithful and pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what a joyful gust of wind
Are you breathing here in Padua from old Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Like the wind that disperses young people across the world,
To seek their fortune further than home
Where a little experience develops. But in some,
Lord Hortensio, so it is for me:
Antonio, my father, died;
And I immersed myself in this labyrinth,
Perhaps to live and prosper as best I can:
I have crowns in my purse and possessions at home,
And so I came abroad to see the world.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, must I then come to you
And wish you a clever and clever wife?
You would thank me a little for my advice:
And yet I promise you that she will be rich
And very rich: but you are too much my friend,
And I wouldn't wish it on him.

PETRUCHIO:
Lord Hortensio, among friends like us
Few words are enough; and so, if you know
A woman rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
As wealth is the burden of my courting dance,
May it be as foul as Florentius's love was,
As old as Sibyl and as brooding and clever
Like Socrates' Xanthippus, or worse,
It doesn't move me, or doesn't take me away, at least,
The edge of affection in me, was it so hard
Just like the swollen Adriatic seas:
I have come to marry her richly in Padua;
So rich, then happy in Padua.

GRUMIO:
No, look, sir, he tells you categorically what his
The mind is: why give her enough gold and marry her with
a puppet or baby-aglet; or an old trot without ever
a tooth in the head, even if it has so many diseases
like fifty-two horses: well, nothing is going well anymore,
so the money comes with it.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, since we have come this far,
I will continue on what I touched on in jest.
I can, Petruchio, help you find a wife
With enough wealth, young and beautiful,
Brought up as befits a nice woman:
Its only fault, and that's enough faults,
It's because she's intolerable
And shrewd and rebellious, so beyond measure
If my condition were much worse than it is,
I wouldn't marry him for a gold mine.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, peace! you don't know the effect of gold:
Tell me his father's name and that's enough;
Because I'm going to take her, even if she roars this loud
Like thunder when the clouds crack in autumn.

HORTENSIO:
His father is Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous gentleman:
Her name is Katharina Minola.
Known in Padua for its growling tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
I know her father, even if I don't know her;
And he knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, until I see her;
And so let me be so bold with you
To abandon yourself to this first meeting,
Unless you want to accompany me.

GRUMIO:
Please, sir, let him go while the humor lasts.
O' my word, and she knew him as well as I did, she
I would think that the reprimands would not do him much good:
she will call him perhaps half a dozen rascals:
well, it's nothing; and if it starts once, it will launch
his rope tricks. I'll tell you what sir, and she
bear with him a little, he will throw a figurine in
her face and disfigures her so much that she
will have no more eyes to see than a cat.
You don't know him, sir.

HORTENSIO:
Wait, Petruchio, I have to accompany you,
For in Baptista's keeping, my treasure is:
He has the jewel of my life in his hand,
His youngest daughter, the beautiful Binaca,
And she refuses me and others,
His suitors and rivals in my love,
Assuming this is an impossible thing,
For these faults that I repeated before,
May Katharina never be courted;
Therefore this order was taken by Baptista,
That no one will have access to Bianca
Until Katharina, the curse, had a husband.

GRUMIO:
Katharina the cursed!
A title for a young lady of all titles, the worst.

HORTENSIO:
Now my friend Petruchio must pardon me,
And offer me disguised in sober dresses
To old Baptista as schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
So that I can, thanks to this device, at least
Have time off and leisure to make love to him
And unsuspected, she courts her all by herself.

GRUMIO:
No cheating here! You see, to fool the old people,
how young people pull themselves together!
Master, master, look around you: who's going there, eh?

HORTENSIO:
Peace, Grumio! he is the rival of my love.
Petruchio, wait a bit.

GRUMIO:
A real stripling and a lover!

GRÉMIO:
Alright ; I looked through the note.
Listen, sir: I'm going to have them bound very nicely:
All love books, see them in any hand;
And make sure you don't read him any other lectures:
You understand me: again and again
The liberality of Lord Baptista,
I will fix it with a generosity. Take your paper too,
And let me perfume them very well
Because it is sweeter than the perfume itself
Who they are for. What are you going to read to him?

LUCENTIO:
Whatever I read to him, I will plead for you
As for my boss, rest assured,
As firmly as you were always in place:
Yeah, and maybe with better words
Than you, unless you are a scholar, sir.

GRÉMIO:
Oh this learning, what a thing it is!

GRUMIO:
Oh this woodcock, what an ass!

PETRUCHIO:
Peace, sir!

HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mother! May God bless you, Signor Gremio.

GRÉMIO:
And you are well received, Signior Hortensio.
Show you where I'm going? To Baptista Minola.
I promised to find out carefully
About a schoolmaster for the Bianca fair:
And luckily I had a good light
On this young man, for learning and behavior
Suitable in turn, well read in poetry
And other books, good ones, I guarantee it.

HORTENSIO:
It's good ; and I met a gentleman
Promised to help me with another,
A good musician to instruct our mistress;
Then I will absolutely not be late in my duty
To the beautiful Bianca, whom I love so much.

GRÉMIO:
Beloved of me; and that my actions will prove it.

GRUMIO:
And his bags will prove it.

HORTENSIO:
Gremio, now is not the time to express our love:
Listen to me, and if you speak to me honestly,
I will tell you some indifferent news, good for both.
Here is a gentleman I met by chance,
After agreement on our part to his taste,
Will undertake to court Katharina,
Yes, and marry her, please, her dowry.

GRÉMIO:
So said, so done, it is good.
Hortensio, have you told him all his faults?

PETRUCHIO:
I know she's a brawling, annoying scold:
If that is all, masters, I hear no harm.

GRÉMIO:
No, you tell me, my friend? Which compatriot?

PETRUCHIO:
Born in Verona, son of old Antonio:
My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
And I hope for good days and a long time to see.

GRÉMIO:
O sir, such a life, with such a woman, was strange!
But if you have a stomach, it is the name of God:
I will assist you in everything.
But will you be able to woo this wild cat?

PETRUCHIO:
Will I live?

GRUMIO:
Will he court her? yes, or I will hang her.

PETRUCHIO:
Why did I come here if not with this intention?
Do you think a little noise could intimidate my ears?
Have I not heard the lions roar in my time?
Did I not hear the sea swollen by the winds
Enraged like an angry boar and irritated with sweat?
Didn't I hear big munitions on the ground,
And the thunder of sky artillery in the sky?
Have I not heard in a pitched battle
Loud larums, neighing of steeds and blasts of trumpets?
And do you speak to me in a woman's tongue,
That's not such a big blow to hear
Like a chestnut would do in a farmer's fire?
Shh, shh! fear boys with bugs.

GRUMIO:
Because he fears no one.

GRÉMIO:
Hortensio, listen:
This gentleman fortunately arrived,
My mind assumes so, for its own sake and ours.

HORTENSIO:
I promised we would be contributors
And bear with his accusation of wooing, no matter what.

GRÉMIO:
And that's what we will do, provided he wins.

GRUMIO:
I wish I could have been so sure of a good dinner.

TRANIO:
Gentlemen, God bless you. If I may be bold,
Tell me, I beg you, what is the easiest way
At the house of Signor Baptista Minola?

BIONDELLO:
The one with the two beautiful daughters: isn’t that what you mean?

TRANIO:
Even him, Biondello.

GRÉMIO:
Listen, sir; you don't mean that she--

TRANIO:
Perhaps, he and she, sir: what have you to do?

PETRUCHIO:
She's not the one who scolds, sir, by no means, I pray.

TRANIO:
I don't like reprimands, sir. Biondello, let's go.

LUCENTIO:
Well started, Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, a word before leaving;
Are you a suitor of the servant you speak of, yes or no?

TRANIO:
And if I am, sir, is it an offense?

GRÉMIO:
No; if without more words you manage to get out of it.

TRANIO:
Why, sir, I pray, are the streets not so free
For me as for you?

GRÉMIO:
But neither does she.

TRANIO:
For what reason, I beg you?

GRÉMIO:
For this reason, if you know,
That she is Signor Gremio's favorite love.

HORTENSIO:
That she is Signor Hortensio's chosen one.

TRANIO:
Gently, my masters! if you are gentlemen,
Do me well; listen to me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
To whom my father is not entirely unknown;
And if her daughter were more beautiful than she is,
She may have other suitors, and me first.
The daughter of the beautiful Leda had a thousand suitors;
So well, another beautiful Bianca can have:
And that's what she will do; Lucentio will make one,
Yet Paris came hoping to accelerate alone.

GRÉMIO:
What! this gentleman is going to surpass us all.

LUCENTIO:
Sir, give him the head: I know it will turn out to be a jade.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, what are all these words for?

HORTENSIO:
Sir, allow me to have the audacity to ask you,
Have you ever seen Baptista's daughter?

TRANIO:
No sir; but listen, I say he has two,
The one who is also famous for his growling tongue
Just like the other for beautiful modesty.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, sir, the first is for me; let it pass.

GRÉMIO:
Yes, entrust this work to the great Hercules;
And let it be more than Alcide's twelve.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, please understand this from me:
The youngest girl you listen to
Her father forbids all access to the suitors,
And I don't promise it to any man
Until the older sister got married for the first time:
The youngest is then free and not before.

TRANIO:
If it is true, sir, that you are the man
Must place all of us and me among the others,
And if you break the ice and do this feat,
Reach the elder, free the younger
For our access, to whom the happiness will be to have it
Won't it be so rude to be ungrateful.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, you say that you understand;
And since you claim to be a suitor,
You must, like us, satisfy this gentleman,
To which we all generally rest in contemplation.

TRANIO:
Sir, I will not be released: as a sign of which,
Please can we make it this afternoon,
And the drink celebrates the health of our mistress,
And do like the adversaries in law,
Strive mightily, but eat and drink like friends.

GRUMIO:
O excellent movement! Guys, let's go.

HORTENSIO:
The motion is really good and so be it,
Petruchio, I will be your benvenuto.

BIANCA:
Good sister, do not wrong me, do not wrong yourself,
Make me a servant and a slave;
Which I disdain: but for these other morons,
Untie my hands, I will remove them myself,
Yes, all my clothes, down to my petticoat;
Or what you command me, I will do,
So I know well my duty towards my elders.

CATHERINE:
Of all your suitors, I charge you to say it
The one you love the most: be careful not to hide.

BIANCA:
Believe me, sister, of all men alive
I've never seen this special face before
What I could imagine more than anything else.

CATHERINE:
Minion, you're lying. Isn't that Hortensio?

BIANCA:
If you affect it, sister, I swear it here
I will plead for you myself, but you will have to
him.

CATHERINE:
Oh, so it seems you crave wealth more:
You'll have Gremio to keep you fair.

BIANCA:
Is it for him that you envy me so much?
No, then you're joking, and now I understand
All this time you've only been joking with me:
Please, Sister Kate, untie my hands.

CATHERINE:
If that's a joke, then everything else was.

BAPTIST:
Well, how, madame! where does this insolence come from?
Bianca, step aside. Poor daughter! she's crying.
Go prick your needle; don't interfere with her.
Out of shame, you have an evil spirit,
Why do you wrong the one who has never wronged you?
When did she insult you with a bitter word?

CATHERINE:
His silence mocks me and I will take revenge.

BAPTIST:
What, in my eyes? Bianca, come in.

CATHERINE:
What, you won't suffer me? No, now I see
She is your treasure, she needs a husband;
I have to dance barefoot on her wedding day
And for your love for her, you lead the monkeys to hell.
Don't talk to me: I'll sit down and cry
Until I found an opportunity to take revenge.

BAPTIST:
Was ever a gentleman so distressed as I?
But who comes here?

GRÉMIO:
Hello, neighbor Baptista.

BAPTIST:
Hello, neighbor Gremio.
May God protect you, gentlemen!

PETRUCHIO:
And you, good sir! Pray, don't you have a daughter
Do you call Katharina, beautiful and virtuous?

BAPTIST:
I have a daughter, sir, whose name is Katharina.

GRÉMIO:
You are too direct: go about it in an orderly manner.

PETRUCHIO:
You do me wrong, Signior Gremio: give me permission.
I am a gentleman from Verona, sir,
That hearing of her beauty and her spirit,
His affability and shy modesty,
His wonderful qualities and gentle behavior,
I have the audacity to show myself an advanced guest
In your house, so that my gaze can be the witness
From this report that I have heard so often.
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
I present to you one of my men,
Cunning in music and mathematics,
To fully instruct him in these sciences,
What I know she is aware of:
Accept it, otherwise you are doing me wrong:
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.

BAPTIST:
You're welcome sir; and him, for your good.
But for my daughter Katharina, I know,
She is not for your turn, all the more my sorrow.

PETRUCHIO:
I see that you don't want to part with her,
Or you don't like my company.

BAPTIST:
Do not mistake yourself ; I speak but as I find.
Where are you from, sir? what can I call your name?

PETRUCHIO:
Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
A man well known throughout Italy.

BAPTIST:
I know him well: you are welcome for him.

GRÉMIO:
Save your story, Petruchio, I pray,
Let us also speak, we who are poor petitioners:
Baccaré! you are wonderful forward.

PETRUCHIO:
Oh, forgive me, Signor Gremio; I would gladly do it.

GRÉMIO:
I have no doubt of it, sir; but you will curse your
woo. Neighbor, this is a very grateful gift, I am
sure of that. To express the same kindness, myself,
who were kinder to you than
anyone, give you this young scholar for free,
who studied for a long time in Reims; so cunning
in Greek, Latin and other languages, like the others
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
accept his service.

BAPTIST:
Many thanks, Signor Gremio.
Welcome, good Cambio.
But, kind sir, it seems to me that you walk like a stranger:
may I have the audacity to know the cause of your coming?

TRANIO:
Forgive me, sir, the audacity is mine,
That, being a stranger in this city,
Make me a suitor for your daughter,
To Bianca, beautiful and virtuous.
And your firm resolve is not unknown to me,
In older sister's preference.
This freedom is all I ask for,
That, knowing my parentage,
I may have welcomed among the others who court
And free access and favor like the rest:
And, for the education of your daughters,
I tune here a simple instrument,
And this little package of Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then their value is great.

BAPTIST:
Lucentio is your name; where do I pray from?

TRANIO:
From Pisa, sir; son of Vincentio.

BAPTIST:
A powerful man from Pisa; compared with
I know him well: you’re welcome, sir,
Take the lute, and you the books;
You will go see your students later.
Holla, inside!
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
To my daughters; and tell them both,
They are their tutors: tell them to make good use of them.
We will go for a little walk in the orchard,
And then dinner. You are welcome to pass through,
And so I beg you all to think for yourselves.

PETRUCHIO:
Lord Baptista, my affairs require haste,
And every day I can't come courting.
You knew my father well, and in him I,
Remained sole heir of all his lands and property,
What I improved rather than reduced:
So tell me, if I receive your daughter's love,
What dowry will I have with her as my wife?

BAPTIST:
After my death, half of my lands,
And in possession of twenty thousand crowns.

PETRUCHIO:
And, against this dowry, I will assure him
Her widowhood, whether she survives me,
In all my land and leases whatever they may be:
Let specialties emerge between us,
These alliances can be respected by one side or the other.

BAPTIST:
Yes, when the special thing is well obtained,
That is to say his love; because it is everything in everything.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, it's nothing: for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptory as she is proud of spirit;
And where two raging fires meet
They consume the thing that fuels their fury:
Even if the small fire grows with little wind,
However, extreme gusts put out the fire and everything:
Thus I am towards her and thus she yields to me;
Because I'm tough and I don't court like a baby.

BAPTIST:
Well, may you court, and blessed be your speed!
But be prepared for a few unfortunate words.

PETRUCHIO:
Yes, to the proof; as the mountains are for the winds,
It doesn't shake, even though they blow perpetually.

BAPTIST:
Well, my friend! why are you so pale?

HORTENSIO:
Out of fear, I promise, if I look pale.

BAPTIST:
What, will my daughter turn out to be a good musician?

HORTENSIO:
I think she will become a soldier sooner
Iron can hold with her, but never the lute.

BAPTIST:
Why, then you can't make her play the lute?

HORTENSIO:
Why no ; because she broke my lute.
I did it but I told her she had the wrong frets,
And she bowed her hand to teach him to play with her fingers;
When, with a most impatient diabolical spirit,
“Frets, what do you call that?” " she says ; 'I'm going to fume
with them:'
And, with this word, she hit me on the head,
And through the instrument my dough made its way;
And there I stood amazed for a moment,
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
While she called me a naughty fiddler
And Jack trembling; with twenty such vile terms,
Just like she had studied to abuse me.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, in the world, she is a vigorous girl;
I love him ten times more than ever:
Oh, how I want to chat with her!

BAPTIST:
Well, come with me and don't be so taken aback:
Carry out the practice with my youngest daughter;
She is willing to learn and grateful for good luck.
Signor Petruchio, will you accompany us,
Where should I send you my daughter Kate?

PETRUCHIO:
I pray that you do.
I will assist him here,
And court her with a little enthusiasm when she comes.
Say she moans; why then I will tell him clearly
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Say she frowns, I'll say she looks as fair
Like morning roses newly washed by dew:
Say that she is mute and will not say a word;
Then I will salute his volubility,
And say she utters piercing eloquence:
If she asks me to pack, I'll thank her,
As if she asked me to stay with her for a week:
If she refuses to marry, I will long for this day
When will I apply for banns and when will I get married?
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speaks.
Hello, Kate; for that is your name, I hear.

CATHERINE:
Well, you heard, but something hard to hear:
They call me Katharina and talk about me.

PETRUCHIO:
You lie with faith; because your name is simply Kate,
And the beautiful Kate and sometimes the cursed Kate;
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
Kate from Kate Hall, my super-delicate Kate,
For the treats are all Kates, and so, Kate,
Take this from me, Kate, my consolation;
Hearing your sweetness praised in every city,
Your virtues spoke and your beauty resonated,
Yet not so deeply that it belongs to you,
I myself am moved to court you for my wife.

CATHERINE:
Moved! in time: leave the one who brought you here
Get away from here: I knew you at the beginning
You were mobile.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, what is furniture?

CATHERINE:
A common stool.

PETRUCHIO:
You touched him: come and sit on me.

CATHERINE:
Asses are made to endure, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to endure, and so are you.

CATHERINE:
There's no jade like you, if you mean me.

PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I will not burden you;
Because, knowing you are young and light...

CATHERINE:
Too light for a man like you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should--buzz!

CATHERINE:
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
O slow-winged turtle! will a buzzard take you away?

CATHERINE:
Yes, for a turtle, like he takes a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, wasp; My goodness, you are too angry.

CATHERINE:
If I am naughty, beware of my sting.

PETRUCHIO:
My remedy then is to tear it out.

CATHERINE:
Yes, if that fool could find him where he is,

PETRUCHIO:
Who doesn't know where a wasp goes
carry your sting? In his tail.

CATHERINE:
In his language.

PETRUCHIO:
Which language ?

CATHERINE:
To you, if you talk about tails: and then goodbye.

PETRUCHIO:
What, with my tongue in your cock? no, come back,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.

CATHERINE:
That, I'm going to try.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear I'll handcuff you if you hit again.

CATHERINE:
So may you lose your arms:
If you hit me, you are not a gentleman;
And if there is no gentleman, why then no weapons.

PETRUCHIO:
A herald, Kate? Oh, put me in your books!

CATHERINE:
What is your badge? a strong one?

PETRUCHIO:
A rooster without a comb, so Kate will be my hen.

CATHERINE:
No cock of mine; you too sing like a chicken.

PETRUCHIO:
No, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.

CATHERINE:
It's my fashion when I see a crab.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, there's no crab here; and therefore does not look sour.

CATHERINE:
There are, there are.

PETRUCHIO:
So show it to me.

CATHERINE:
If I had a drink, I would.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you mean my face?

CATHERINE:
Well intended for one so young.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint George, I'm too young for you.

CATHERINE:
And yet you are withered.

PETRUCHIO:
It's with concern.

CATHERINE:
I do not care.

PETRUCHIO:
No, listen to yourself, Kate: the truth is, you don't get away with it.

CATHERINE:
I irritate you, if I delay: let me go.

PETRUCHIO:
No, not at all: I find you rather gentle.
I was told that you were rough, shy and sullen,
And now I find the report very misleading;
Because you are pleasant, playful, temporarily courteous,
But slow to speak, but sweet as spring flowers:
You can't frown, you can't look askance,
Nor bite my lip, like angry girls would,
Nor do you enjoy being angry while speaking,
But you gently entertain your suitors,
With a gentle, gentle and affable lecture.
Why is the world reporting that Kate has a limp?
O slanderous world! Kate likes the hazel twig
Is straight and thin and also brown in color
Like hazelnuts and sweeter than the stones.
Oh, let me see you walk: you don't stop.

CATHERINE:
Go, fool, and whoever you obey.

PETRUCHIO:
Has Dian become a grove
Like Kate this room with her princely approach?
Oh, be Dian, and let her be Kate;
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sporty!

CATHERINE:
Where did you study all this beautiful speech?

PETRUCHIO:
It's improvised, from my maternal spirit.

CATHERINE:
A witty mother! without other his son.

PETRUCHIO:
Am I not wise?

CATHERINE:
Yes; keep you warm.

PETRUCHIO:
Get married, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in your bed:
And so, putting all this conversation aside,
So in clear terms: your father consented
That you will be my wife; your dowry is greedy;
And, if you want, no, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband to you;
For, by this light by which I see your beauty,
Your beauty, which makes me love you,
You must not be married to any other man than me;
For I am, he was born to tame you Kate,
And take you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Consistent with the other Kates in the house.
Here is your father: never deny;
I must and will have Katharina for my wife.

BAPTIST:
Now, Signior Petruchio, how are you with my daughter?

PETRUCHIO:
How, but well, sir? how but good?
There was no way I could accelerate badly.

BAPTIST:
Well, how now, my daughter Katharina! in your landfills?

CATHERINE:
Call me my daughter? now I promise you
You showed tender paternal consideration,
To wish me to marry a half-madman;
A crazy thug and a swearing Jack,
This thinks with oath to face the matter.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, so it is: you yourself and the whole world,
Those who spoke of her, spoke badly of her:
If she is cursed, it is for political reasons,
For she is not rebellious, but modest like the dove;
It is not hot, but temperate like the morning;
For her patience she will prove a second Grisel,
And Roman Lucretia for her chastity:
And to conclude, we lived so well together,
Sunday is the wedding day.

CATHERINE:
I'll see you hanged on Sunday first.

GRÉMIO:
Listen, Petruchio; she says she will see you
hanged first.

TRANIO:
Is it your speeding ticket? no, then, good night, our part!

PETRUCHIO:
Be patient, gentlemen; I choose it for myself:
If she and I are happy, what does that matter to you?
It's a deal between the two of us, being alone,
That she will always be cursed in company.
I tell you, it's incredible to believe
How much she loves me: O sweetest Kate!
She clung to my neck; and kiss after kiss
She competed so quickly, protesting oath after oath,
In the blink of an eye, she won me over to her love.
O you are novices! it's a world to see,
How tame it is, when men and women are alone,
A wretched maacock can make the most cursed shrew.
Give me your hand, Kate: I will go to Venice,
To buy clothes for the wedding day.
Prepare the feast, father, and invite the guests;
I will be sure that my Katharina will be fine.

BAPTIST:
I don't know what to say: but give me your hands;
God sends you joy, Petruchio! it's a match.

GRÉMIO:
Amen, we say: we will be witnesses.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, wife and gentlemen, farewell;
I will go to Venice; Sunday is just around the corner:
We'll have rings and everything, and a nice assortment;
And kiss me, Kate, we'll get married on Sunday.

GRÉMIO:
Has a match ever been applauded so suddenly?

BAPTIST:
Well, gentlemen, I now play the role of a merchant,
And venturing madly into a desperate market.

TRANIO:
“It was a commodity you were worried about:
This will bring you profit, or you will perish on the seas.

BAPTIST:
The gain I am looking for is calm in the match.

GRÉMIO:
Without a doubt, he had a quiet take.
But now, Baptists, to your youngest daughter:
Now is the day we have been waiting for for a long time:
I am your neighbor and I was the first suitor.

TRANIO:
And I'm one of those who love Bianca more
That words can bear witness or your thoughts can guess.

GRÉMIO:
Young, you can't love as dearly as I do.

TRANIO:
Graybeard, your love is frozen.

GRÉMIO:
But yours is frying.
Boss, step back: it’s age that feeds.

TRANIO:
But youth in the eyes of women who flourishes.

BAPTIST:
Be content, gentlemen: I am going to aggravate this conflict:
It is his actions that must win the prize; and he of the two
This can ensure my daughter the biggest dowry
I will have the love of my Bianca.
Say, Signor Gremio, what can you assure him?

GRÉMIO:
First, as you know, my house in the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Basins and ewers to wash his delicate hands;
My hangings are all Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory chests I have stuffed my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoint,
Expensive clothing, tents and awnings,
Fine linen, turkey cushions embossed with pearls,
Venice valance in needlepoint gold,
Tin and brass and everything that belongs
At home or in the household: then, on my farm
I have a hundred milk kine in the bucket,
Six and twenty large oxen standing in my stables,
And everything that depends on this part.
I myself am struck by age, I must admit;
And if I die tomorrow, this is hers,
If as long as I live, she will only be mine.

TRANIO:
This “only” is welcome. Sir, list me:
I am the heir and only son of my father:
If I can have your daughter as my wife,
I will leave his houses three or four as well,
In the rich walls of Pisa, like anyone
The old lord Gremio is in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats per year
Fertile land, all that will be his.
What, did I pinch you, Signor Gremio?

GRÉMIO:
Two thousand ducats per year of land!
My land doesn't represent much in total:
That she will have; apart from an argosy
This is now on the road to Marseille.
What, did I choke you with an argosy?

TRANIO:
Gremio, we know that my father is no less
Than three great argosias; in addition to two galliases,
And twelve narrow galleys: I will assure him of them,
And twice as much, whatever you offer next.

GRÉMIO:
No, I offered everything, I have no more;
And she can't have more than all I have:
If you love me, she will have me and mine.

TRANIO:
Well, then the servant is mine from the whole world,
By your firm promise: Gremio is surpassed.

BAPTIST:
I must admit that your offer is the best;
And let your father give him assurance,
She's yours ; if not, you must forgive me,
If you die before him, where is his dowry?

TRANIO:
It's just a refrain: he's old, I'm young.

GRÉMIO:
And can't young men die as well as old men?

BAPTIST:
Well, gentlemen,
I am thus resolved: next Sunday you know
My daughter Katharina is getting married:
Now, next Sunday, Bianca
Be your wife, if you have this assurance;
Otherwise, Signor Gremio:
So, I take my leave and thank you both.

GRÉMIO:
Farewell, good neighbor.
Now I no longer fear you:
Sirrah young player, your father was a fool
To give you everything, and in his decreasing age
Put your feet under your table: but, a toy!
An old Italian fox isn't so nice, boy.

TRANIO:
Revenge on your withered and artful skin!
Yet I faced him with a ten card.
It's in my head to do good to my master:
I don't see any reason but I guess Lucentio
He must have a father, called “supposedly Vincentio”;
And it's a wonder: fathers generally
Get their children; but in this case of courting,
A child will have a father, if I'm not lacking in cunning.

LUCENTIO:
Violin, refrain; you are moving too far, sir:
Did you forget entertainment so quickly
Did his sister Katharina also welcome you?

HORTENSIO:
But, quarrelsome pedant, it is
The patroness of heavenly harmony:
So give me permission to have this prerogative;
And when we spent an hour in music,
Your conference will still have some fun.

LUCENTIO:
An absurd ass, which has never been read until now
To know the reason why the music was ordered!
Was it not to refresh the spirit of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
So give me permission to read philosophy,
And while I pause, serve in your harmony.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, I won't stand for your braves.

BIANCA:
Well, gentlemen, you do me doubly harm,
Strive for what depends on my choice:
I am not a mediocre scholar in schools;
I will not be tied to specific hours or schedules,
But learn my lessons on my own terms.
And to end all quarrels, let's sit here:
Take your instrument, play yourself from time to time;
His lecture will be given before you listen.

HORTENSIO:
Will you leave his lecture when I'm listening?

LUCENTIO:
This will never be the case: tune your instrument.

BIANCA:
Where did we last go?

LUCENTIO:
Here, madam:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic is Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Build them.

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat', as I already told you, 'Simois', I am
Lucentio, 'hic est', son of Vincentio of Pisa,
“Sigeia tellus”, disguised like this to get your love;
'Hic steterat', and this Lucentio who comes
I court, "Priami", it's my man Tranio, "regia",
wearing my port, "celsa senis", so that we can
trick the old pants.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, my instrument is in tune.

BIANCA:
Let's listen. Oh fi! triple pots.

LUCENTIO:
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

BIANCA:
Now let me see if I can interpret it: 'Hic ibat
Simois, I don't know you, hic is Sigeia tellus, I
don't trust yourself; 'Hic steterat Priami', be careful
he does not hear us, 'regia', does not presume, 'celsa senis',
no despair.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, it is now in tune.

LUCENTIO:
Everything except the basics.

HORTENSIO:
The basis is good; It’s the vile valet who’s disturbing.
How fiery and avant-garde our pedant is!
Now, for my life, the knave woos my love:
Pedascule, I will watch you even better.

BIANCA:
With time, I can believe, but I am wary.

LUCENTIO:
Don't be suspicious: because, of course, AEacides
It was Ajax, so called by his grandfather.

BIANCA:
I must believe my master; if not, I promise you,
I should still argue on this doubt:
But let it go. Now, Licio, over to you:
Good masters, do not take it the wrong way, pray,
That I have been so nice to you both.

HORTENSIO:
You can go for a walk and give me a moment:
My classes do not do any three-part music.

LUCENTIO:
Are you so formal, sir? well I have to wait,
And watch at the same time; because, but I'm wrong,
Our handsome musician becomes in love.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, before touching the instrument,
To know the order of my fingerings,
We must begin with the rudiments of the art;
To teach you the scale in a more brief way,
More pleasant, concise and efficient,
What did none of my professions learn:
And there it is written, quite drawn.

BIANCA:
Well, I'm long past my range.

HORTENSIO:
However, read the entire range of Hortensio.

BIANCA:

Servant:
Mistress, your father prays that you leave your books
And help dress your sister's room:
You know tomorrow is the wedding day.

BIANCA:
Farewell, both gentle masters; I must be gone.

LUCENTIO:
Well, mistress, then I have no reason to stay.

HORTENSIO:
But I'm right to delve into this pedant:
It seems to me that he seems to be in love:
Yet if your thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
To cast your wandering eyes on every state,
Take hold of this list: if I ever find you browsing,
Hortensio will separate from you while changing.

BAPTIST:

CATHERINE:
No shame but my own: I must, indeed, be forced
To give my hand opposite my heart
To a crazy brain full of spleen;
Who courted in haste and intends to marry at leisure.
I told you, he was a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter jokes in brutal behavior:
And, to note for a cheerful man,
He will court a thousand, point the wedding day,
Have parties, invite friends and proclaim bans;
Yet he never intends to marry where he courted.
Now the world must point the finger at poor Katharina,
And say: "This is the wife of the madman Petruchio,
If she likes it, come and marry her!

TRANIO:
Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
On my life, Petruchio wants to say, but hey,
Whatever fortune prevents him from keeping his word:
Even if he is frank, I know him to be quite wise;
Although he is cheerful, he is nevertheless honest.

CATHERINE:
Would Katharina never have seen him!

BAPTIST:
Come on, my daughter; I can't blame you for crying now;
For such a wound would irritate a most saint,
Much more a shrew of your impatient humor.

BIONDELLO:
Master, master! new, old news and new ones such as
You've never heard of it !

BAPTIST:
Is it new and old too? How is it possible ?

BIONDELLO:
Why isn't it news to learn of Petruchio's arrival?

BAPTIST:
Did he come?

BIONDELLO:
Well, no, sir.

BAPTIST:
So what ?

BIONDELLO:
He is coming.

BAPTIST:
When will he be there?

BIONDELLO:
When he stands where I am and sees you there.

TRANIO:
But say, what about your old news?

BIONDELLO:
Well, Petruchio comes with a new hat and an old
doublet, old breeches turned three times, a pair
of boots which were candle cases, one of which was buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword taken out of the
the city armory, with a broken hilt and without a chapel;
with two broken points: his horse hip with a
an old unrelated saddle and stirrups;
plus i'm possessed by snot and i love mose
in the spine; troubled by lampas, infected
with the modes, full of wings, accelerated with
spavins, radiated with yellows, past healed from the five,
completely spoiled by the staggers, started with the
robots, swung in the back and touched in the shoulder;
quasi-legs before and with, a little half-checked
and a sheepskin headpiece which, being
restrained to prevent him from tripping, was
often broken and now repaired with knots; a circumference
six reconstituted pieces and a woman's rump in velvet,
who has two letters for his name written quite well
made of dowels, and here and there pieced together with bundle thread.

BAPTIST:
Who is coming with him?

BIONDELLO:
O, sir, his lackey, for everyone caparisoned
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
on the other, Kersey boots, with a red garter
and blue list; an old hat and "forty-year-old humor"
fantasies are not piqued for a feather: a monster, a
very freak in clothes, and not like a Christian
a gentleman's footman or lackey.

TRANIO:
It’s a strange sense of humor that pushes him this way;
However, it often happens that he goes away wearing mean clothes.

BAPTIST:
I'm glad it came, however it came.

BIONDELLO:
Well, sir, he's not coming.

BAPTIST:
Didn't you say he was coming?

BIONDELLO:
WHO? that Petruchio came?

BAPTIST:
Yes, this Petruchio has come.

BIONDELLO:
No, sir, I say his horse is coming, with him on its back.

BAPTIST:
Well, it's all one.

BIONDELLO:
No, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you a penny,
A horse and a man
It's more than one,
And yet not many people.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, where are these gallants? who is at home?

BAPTIST:
Please, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
And yet I am not well.

BAPTIST:
And yet, you don't stop.

TRANIO:
Not so well dressed
As I wish you were.

PETRUCHIO:
If it were better, I would rush like this.
But where is Kate? where is my lovely wife?
How is my father? Gentlemen, it seems to me that you are frowning:
And why look at this good company,
As if they saw a wonderful monument,
Comet or unusual prodigy?

BAPTIST:
Well, sir, you know it's your wedding day:
At first we were sad, fearing that you would not come;
It's even sadder that you came so badly.
Fi, remove this habit, shame on your inheritance,
A plague for our solemn celebration!

TRANIO:
And tells us, what an import opportunity
It has kept you from your wife for so long,
And sent you here so unlike yourself?

PETRUCHIO:
It was tedious to say and hard to hear:
It is enough that I came to keep my word,
Although to some extent obliged to digress;
Which, more at leisure, I will excuse thus
As you will be very satisfied with it.
But where is Kate? I stay away from her too long:
Morning dawns, it's time for us to be at church.

TRANIO:
Don't see your wife in these irreverent dresses:
Go to my room; Put on my clothes.

PETRUCHIO:
Not me, believe me: that's why I'll visit him.

BAPTIST:
But so, I hope you won't marry him.

PETRUCHIO:
Of course, even so; so I'm done with the words:
She is married to me, not my clothes:
Could I repair what she will carry in me,
As I can change these poor accessories,
“It was good for Kate and better for me.
But what an idiot am I to argue with you,
When I should say hello to my fiancée,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!

TRANIO:
He has some significance in his crazy outfit:
We will persuade him, if possible,
To dress better before going to church.

BAPTIST:
I'll pursue it and see what happens.

TRANIO:
But to his love it is important for us to add
His father's taste: which one to make,
As I had already done for your worship,
I must find a man, whoever he is,
He doesn't have many skills. we will adapt it in our turn,--
And he will be Vincentio of Pisa;
And rest assured here in Padua
Larger sums than I promised.
So will you quietly enjoy your hope,
And marry sweet Bianca with her consent.

LUCENTIO:
Isn't it that my fellow schoolmaster
He watches Bianca's steps so carefully,
“It was good, I think, to steal our marriage;
Who once executed, let everyone say no,
I'll keep mine, despite everyone else.

TRANIO:
Which we intend to examine gradually,
And look at our advantage in this matter:
We will overcome the gray beard, Gremio,
The indiscreet father, Minola,
The picturesque musician, the lover Licio;
All this for the sake of my master, Lucentio.
Signor Gremio, are you from the church?

GRÉMIO:
As happily as ever, I returned from school.

TRANIO:
And are the bride and groom coming home?

GRÉMIO:
A groom, you say? he's really a groom,
A grumpy groom, and that the young girl will find.

TRANIO:
Badder than her? well, that's impossible.

GRÉMIO:
Why he's a devil, a devil, a real demon.

TRANIO:
Well, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's mother.

GRÉMIO:
But she's a lamb, a dove, an idiot to him!
I will tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
I should ask if Katharina should be his wife,
“Yes, by gogs-wouns,” said he; and I swore so loudly,
That, astonished, the priest dropped the book;
And, as he stooped down again to pick it up,
The crazy groom took such a beating
There fell priest and book and book and priest:
“Now take them,” he said, “if there is a list.” »

TRANIO:
What did the young girl say when she got up?

GRÉMIO:
Trembled and shaken; why, he knocked and swore,
As if the vicar wanted to comfort him.
But after many ceremonies performed,
He asks for wine: “Health!” » he said, as if
He was on board, partying with his friends
After a storm; drank muscadel
And he threw all the nonsense in the sexton's face;
Having no other reason
But his beard has become thin and hungry
And he seemed to ask her stuff while he was drinking.
This done, he took the bride by the neck
And I kissed her lips with such a loud smack
That at the separation, the whole Church echoed:
And seeing this, I came from there with great shame;
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a crazy wedding has never existed before:
Listen, listen! I hear the minstrels playing.

PETRUCHIO:
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your trouble:
I know you're thinking of having dinner with me today,
And I have prepared a great store of wedding joy;
But it is so, my haste calls me from here,
This is why I intend to take my leave.

BAPTIST:
Is it not possible for you to leave tonight?

PETRUCHIO:
I have to go away today, before night comes:
This is not surprising; if you knew my job,
You would rather beg me to leave than to stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all,
Who saw me give myself
To this very patient, gentle and virtuous wife:
Dine with my father, give me a drink;
Because I must go; and farewell to you all.

TRANIO:
Let us beg you to stay until after dinner.

PETRUCHIO:
This may not be the case.

GRÉMIO:
Let me beg you.

PETRUCHIO:
It can not be.

CATHERINE:
Let me beg you.

PETRUCHIO:
I am happy.

CATHERINE:
Are you happy to stay?

PETRUCHIO:
I'm glad you begged me to stay;
But don't stay, beg me as much as you can.

CATHERINE:
Now if you love me, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Grumio, my horse.

GRUMIO:
Yes, sir, be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.

CATHERINE:
No, then,
Do what you can, I won't go today;
No, not tomorrow, not until I like it.
The door is open, sir; this is where your path lies;
You may be jogging while your boots are green;
For me, I will only leave when I feel like it:
It's as if you would show yourself a cheerful and surly groom,
It hits you at first so frankly.

PETRUCHIO:
O Kate, be content; Please don't be angry.

CATHERINE:
I will be angry: what do you have to do?
Father, be silent; it will remain my hobby.

GRÉMIO:
Yes, get married, sir, now it's starting to work.

KATARINE:
Gentlemen, onward to the wedding dinner:
I see that a woman can become stupid,
If she didn't have the spirit to resist.

PETRUCHIO:
They will advance, Kate, at your command.
Obey the bride, you who care for her;
Go to the party, rejoice and dominate,
Take full measure of her virginity,
Be crazy and happy, or go hang yourself:
But for my beautiful Kate, she must be with me.
No, don't look big, don't stomp, don't stare, don't worry;
I will be master of what is mine:
She is my possessions, my furniture; she is my home,
My domestic affairs, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my donkey, my anything;
And there it is, touch it to anyone who dares;
I will focus my action on the proudest of him
This stops me at Padua. Grumio,
Take out your weapon, we are besieged by thieves;
Save your mistress, if you are a man.
Don't worry, sweet girl, they won't touch
you, Kate:
I'll get you for a million.

BAPTIST:
No, let them go, some of them alone.

GRÉMIO:
They didn't go quickly, I was dying of laughter.

TRANIO:
Of all the crazy matches, it has never been the same.

LUCENTIO:
Mistress, what is your opinion of your sister?

BIANCA:
Being mad herself, she is madly coupled.

GRÉMIO:
I guarantee it, Petruchio is Kate.

BAPTIST:
Neighbors and friends, although married and
the groom wants
To replenish the places at the table,
You know there are no junkets at the party.
Lucentio, you will replace the bridegroom:
And let Bianca take her sister's room.

TRANIO:
Will sweet Bianca train to marry him?

BAPTIST:
She will, Lucentio. Come gentlemen, let's go.

GRUMIO:
Fi, fi to all the tired jades, to all the mad masters, and
all bad manners! Was man ever beaten like this? has never been
man so radiant? Was man ever so tired? I am sent
before making a fire, and they come afterwards to
warm them up. Now wasn't I a potty and soon
hot, my lips could freeze to my teeth, my
tongue on the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
belly, before I come near a fire to defrost myself: but
I, by blowing the fire, will warm myself; For,
given the weather, a man taller than me
catch a cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.

CURTIS:
Who is calling so coldly?

GRUMIO:
A piece of ice: if you doubt it, you can slip
From my shoulder to my heel without further travel
but my head and my neck. Good luck Curtis.

CURTIS:
Are my master and his wife coming, Grumio?

GRUMIO:
Oh, yes, Curtis, yes: and so the fire, the fire; casting
without water.

CURTIS:
Is she as sexy a vixen as she claims?

GRUMIO:
She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, you
the most knowledgeable, winter tames man, woman and beast; for that
tamed my old master and my new mistress and
myself, Comrade Curtis.

CURTIS:
Go away, you three-inch fool! I'm not a beast.

GRUMIO:
I'm only three inches tall? well, your horn is a foot; And
I’ve been at least that long. But do you want to make a
fire, or should I complain about you to our mistress,
whose hand, being now within reach, you will soon have to
do you feel, to your cold comfort, being slow in your hot office?

CURTIS:
Please, good Grumio, tell me, how is the world?

GRUMIO:
A cold world, Curtis, in every office except yours; And
therefore fire: do your duty and fulfill your duty; For
my master and mistress almost died of cold.

CURTIS:
The fire is ready; and so, good Grumio, the news.

GRUMIO:
Well, “Jack, my boy!” ho! boy!' and as much news as
will defrost.

CURTIS:
Come on, you're so full of cony-catchers!

GRUMIO:
Well, then the fire; because I caught a bad cold.
Where is the cook? dinner is ready, home
pruned, rushes strewn, cobwebs swept away; THE
servants in their new fust, their white clothes
stockings, and each officer his wedding garment?
Be the fair jacks within, the fair jills without,
the carpets laid, and everything is in order?

CURTIS:
Everything is ready ; and therefore, please, some news.

GRUMIO:
First, know that my horse is tired; my master and
the mistress has fallen.

CURTIS:
How?

GRUMIO:
Out of their stools in the earth; and so
tell a story.

CURTIS:
Let's go, good Grumio.

GRUMIO:
Listen.

CURTIS:
Here.

GRUMIO:
There.

CURTIS:
It's about feeling a story, not hearing a story.

GRUMIO:
And that is why it is called a sensible tale: and this
the cuff was only to knock on your ear and implore
listen. Now I begin: Imprimis, we went down a
filthy hill, my master riding behind my mistress,...

CURTIS:
Two from the same horse?

GRUMIO:
What does that do to you?

CURTIS:
Well, a horse.

GRUMIO:
Tell yourself the story: but if you hadn't upset me,
you should have heard how her horse fell and she
under his horse; you should have heard how
in a quagmire place, how she was humiliated, how he left her
with the horse on her, how he beat me because
her horse stumbled, how she floundered in the earth
to tear him away from me, how he swore, how she prayed,
who has never prayed before, how I cried, how the
the horses ran away, how his bridle broke, how I
I lost my rump, with many things worthy of memory,
who will now die in oblivion and you will return
inexperienced in your grave.

CURTIS:
By this calculation, he is smarter than her.

GRUMIO:
Yes ; and that you and the proudest of you
find it when he gets home. But what do I say?
Call Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the others: may their heads be at peace
elegantly combed their brushed blue coats and their
garters of indifferent knitting: let them curtsy
with their left legs and do not pretend to touch a hair
of my master's horsetail until they kiss their
hands. Are they all ready?

CURTIS:
They are.

GRUMIO:
Call them.

CURTIS:
Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
face my mistress.

GRUMIO:
Well, she has her own face.

CURTIS:
Who doesn't know it?

GRUMIO:
It looks like you're calling for company
face it.

CURTIS:
I'm calling them to give him credit.

GRUMIO:
Well, she comes so as not to borrow anything from them.

NATHANIEL:
Welcome home, Grumio!

PHILIP:
Well, Grumio!

JOSEPH:
What, Grumio!

Nicholas:
Friend Grumio!

NATHANIEL:
What now, old man?

GRUMIO:
Welcome, you ;--how now, you ;-- what, you ;--my friend,
YOU ; and that's it for the greeting. Now my spruce
My friends, is everything ready and everything is tidy?

NATHANIEL:
Everything is ready. How far away is our master?

GRUMIO:
E'en at hand, come down by this; and therefore be
no... Passion of the rooster, silence! I hear my master.

PETRUCHIO:
Where are these rascals? What, no man at the door
Hold my stirrup or take my horse!
Where are Nathaniel, Grégory, Philippe?

ALL SERVICE MEN:
Here, here, sir; here, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
You stubborn, rude grooms!
What, no presence? regardless ? no homework ?
Where is the foolish servant I sent before?

GRUMIO:
Here, sir; as stupid as before.

PETRUCHIO:
You peasant! You fucking malt-horse executioner!
Didn't I invite you to meet me in the park,
And take these rascals with you?

GRUMIO:
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps weren't pink at the heels;
There was no connection to color Peter's hat,
And Walter's dagger was not out of the sheath:
There was no one there but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
The others were in rags, old and miserable;
Yet, as they are, here they come to meet you.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, you rascals, go get my supper.
Where is the life I led late in life...
Where are they... Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
Sound, sound, sound, sound!
Why, when, I say? No, my dear Kate, be cheerful.
Take off my boots, you rascals! you bad guys, when?
He was the brother of the gray orders,
As he walked away:
Get out, you thug! you tear off my crooked foot:
Take this one and fix the other torn one.
Be cheerful, Kate. A little water here; what, ho!
Where is my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, go,
And tell my cousin Ferdinand to come here:
One, Kate, you need to kiss and know.
Where are my slippers? Should I have water?
Come, Kate, wash yourself and give yourself a warm welcome.
You evil son of a bitch! are you going to drop it?

CATHERINE:
Patience, please; it was a mistake not to want to.

PETRUCHIO:
A fucking rascal with the head of a beetle and folded ears!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a belly.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or should I do it?
What is this? mutton?

First Servant:
Yes.

PETRUCHIO:
Who brought it?

ROCK :
I.

PETRUCHIO:
It's burned; and all the meat too.
What are these dogs! Where is the naughty cook?
How dare you wicked people take it out of the chest of drawers,
And serve it to me like this, to me who doesn't like it?
Bring it to you, slicers, cups and all;
You careless idiots and unmannered slaves!
What, are you complaining? I will be with you directly.

CATHERINE:
Please, husband, don't be so worried:
The meat was good, if you were so happy.

PETRUCHIO:
I tell you, Kate, it was burnt and dried;
And I am expressly forbidden to touch it,
For it breeds anger, plants anger;
And we both better be quick,
Since we ourselves are angry,
Than feed him with such roasted flesh.
Be patient; tomorrow it will be fixed,
And, for this night, we will fast for company:
Come, I will take you to your bridal chamber.

NATHANIEL:
Peter, have you ever seen anything like this?

ROCK :
He kills it in his own humor.

GRUMIO:
Where is he?

CURTIS:
In his room, giving him a lecture on continence;
And mocks, and swears, and evaluates, that she, poor soul,
Doesn't know where to stand, look, speak,
And he sits like a newborn from a dream.
Far, far! because he comes here.

PETRUCHIO:
Thus I began my reign politically,
And it is my hope to finish successfully.
My falcon is now lively and passes empty;
And until she stoops, she must not be full,
Because then she never looks at her bait.
Another way to deal with my haggard,
So that she comes to know the call of her guardian,
In other words, to look at it, as we look at these kites
This beat and beat and will not be obedient.
She doesn't eat meat today, and no one will;
Last night she did not sleep, and this night she will not sleep either;
As with meat, an undeserved fault
I'm going to find out about making the bed;
And here I will throw the pillow, there the bolster,
So the bedspread, otherwise the sheets:
Yes, and in the midst of this tumult, I intend
That everything is done with reverend care for her;
And in conclusion she will stay up all night:
And if she gets the chance to acquiesce, I'm going to argue and fight
And with the clamor, keep her still awake.
This is one way to kill a woman with kindness;
And so I will repress his crazy and stubborn humor.
He who knows best how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak: it is charity to show.

TRANIO:
Is it not possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Do you want someone other than Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she holds me well in hand.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Stand by and mark the way he teaches.

LUCENTIO:
Now, mistress, do you benefit from what you read?

BIANCA:
What, master, have I read you? solve this for me first.

LUCENTIO:
I read that I profess the Art of Loving.

BIANCA:
And may you show yourself, sir, master of your art!

LUCENTIO:
While you, my sweet darling, reveal yourself to be the mistress of my heart!

HORTENSIO:
Go quickly, get married! Now tell me, I pray,
You who dared to swear against your mistress Bianca
There was no one in the world who loved him as much as Lucentio.

TRANIO:
O love in spite of itself! a fickle woman!
I tell you, Licio, it's wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
Make no mistake: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
But he who despises to live under this disguise,
For one who leaves a gentleman,
And made a god of such a cullion:
Know, sir, that my name is Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Lord Hortensio, I have often heard
With all your affection for Bianca;
And since my eyes witness its lightness,
I will be with you, if you are so happy,
Give up Bianca and her love forever.

HORTENSIO:
See how they kiss and court! Lord Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I make the firm vow
No longer woo her, but renounce her,
Like one unworthy of all the old favors
That I flattered her with tenderness.

TRANIO:
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
Never marry her, even if she begs:
Fier on her! see how she gives him a bestial courtship!

HORTENSIO:
Everyone would want him to, but he had completely given up!
For me, that I may surely keep my oath,
I will be married to a rich widow,
Before three days pass, the one who has loved me so long
How I loved this proud and disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Signor Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauty,
I will win my love: and so I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before.

TRANIO:
Mistress Bianca, bless you with so much grace
How he desires the blessed case of a lover!
No, I took you for a nap, sweet love,
And I forgave you with Hortensio.

BIANCA:
Tranio, you are joking: but have you both renounced me?

TRANIO:
Mistress, we did it.

LUCENTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
My goodness, he will have a vigorous widow now,
It will be wood and married in a day.

BIANCA:
God, give him joy!

TRANIO:
Yes, and he will tame it.

BIANCA:
He says it, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Well, he went to tamer school.

BIANCA:
Taming school! what, is there such a place?

TRANIO:
Yes, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
This teaches rounds from eleven to twenty,
To tame a shrew and charm its chattering tongue.

BIONDELLO:
O master, master, I have looked so long
That I am tired of dogs: but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Will serve the trick.

TRANIO:
What is Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
Master, merchant or pedant,
I don't know what ; but format in clothing,
In the gait and the face, surely like a father.

LUCENTIO:
And him, Tranio?

TRANIO:
If he is gullible and trusts my story,
I'll make him happy to be like Vincentio,
And gives assurance to Baptista Minola,
As if he was the good Vincentio
Welcome your love, then leave me alone.

Pedantic:
God bless you, sir!

TRANIO:
And you sir! You're welcome.
Are you traveling far or are you as far away as possible?

Pedantic:
Sir, at the most for a week or two:
But then, further away, and as in Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God grants me life.

TRANIO:
What countryman, I pray?

Pedantic:
From Mantua.

TRANIO:
From Mantua, sir? get married, God forbid!
And come to Padua, carefree about your life?

Pedantic:
My life, sir! how do I pray? because it’s going hard.

TRANIO:
It's death for anyone in Mantua
Coming to Padua. You don't know the cause?
Your ships are stationed in Venice, and the duke,
For a private quarrel between your duke and him,
Published and proclaimed it openly:
It's a wonder that you are newly arrived,
You may have heard of it differently.

Pedantic:
Alas! sir, it is worse for me than that;
Because I have money bills by exchange
From Florence and I have to deliver them here.

TRANIO:
Well, sir, as a courtesy,
I will do this and I will advise you this:
First, tell me, have you ever been to Pisa?

Pedantic:
Yes, sir, I have often been to Pisa,
Pisa is known for its serious citizens.

TRANIO:
Among them, do you know a Vincentio?

Pedantic:
I don't know him, but I've heard of him;
A merchant of incomparable wealth.

TRANIO:
It's my father, sir; and, truth be told,
His appearance is a bit like you.

BIONDELLO:

TRANIO:
To save your life in this extremity,
I will do this favor to you because of him;
And think that this is not the worst of your fortune
That you look like Sir Vincentio.
You will assume his name and his credit,
And you will be hosted amicably in my house:
Make sure you take care of yourself as you should;
You understand me, sir: you will stay like this
Until you have done your business in town:
If it's a courtesy, sir, accept it.

Pedantic:
O sir, I do; and I will always make you famous
The boss of my life and my freedom.

TRANIO:
So come with me to make things right.
This, moreover, I let you understand;
my father is searched here every day,
Pass the insurance of a dowry in marriage
“Between me and the daughter of a Baptista here:
In all these circumstances, I will instruct you:
Come with me to dress as suits you.

GRUMIO:
No, no, in truth; I don't dare for my life.

CATHERINE:
The greater my wrong, the more its wickedness appears:
What, he married me to starve me?
Beggars who come to my father's door,
On request, have a present objective;
Otherwise, elsewhere they encounter charity:
But I, who never knew how to beg,
I never had to beg either,
I'm hungry for meat, dizzy from lack of sleep,
With the oath, I stayed awake and fed with fights:
And what annoys me more than all these desires,
He does this under the name of perfect love;
As who should say, whether I should sleep or eat,
“It was a fatal disease or it was death.
Please go and get me some food;
I don't care what, then it will be healthy food.

GRUMIO:
What do you say about a neat foot?

CATHERINE:
It's a good thing: please let me have it.

GRUMIO:
I'm afraid it's too angry meat.
How about a large, finely grilled tripe?

CATHERINE:
I like it: good Grumio, go and get it for me.

GRUMIO:
I can not tell; I'm afraid it's angry.
What do you say about a piece of beef and mustard?

CATHERINE:
A dish that I love to enjoy.

GRUMIO:
Yes, but the mustard is a little too spicy.

CATHERINE:
Well, beef, and let the mustard sit.

GRUMIO:
No, I won't: you'll get the mustard,
Or else you won't get beef from Grumio.

CATHERINE:
So both, or one, or whatever you want.

GRUMIO:
Why then, the mustard without the beef.

CATHERINE:
Go, go, false illusory slave,
This nourishes me from the very name of meat:
Woe to you and all your pack,
This triumph over my misery!
Go, go, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
How is my Kate? What, my dear, is everything paid off?

HORTENSIO:
Mistress, what joy?

CATHERINE:
Faith, as cold as possible.

PETRUCHIO:
Rest assured ; look at me happily.
Here is love; you see how diligent I am
To prepare your meat myself and bring it to you:
I am sure, sweet Kate, that this kindness deserves thanks.
What, not a word? No, then you don't love him;
And all my pains are resolved without proof.
Here, take this dish.

CATHERINE:
Please let it go.

PETRUCHIO:
The poorest service is rewarded with thanks;
And mine too, before you touch the meat.

CATHERINE:
I thank you sir.

HORTENSIO:
Lord Petruchio, fie! it is you who is guilty.
Come, Mistress Kate, I'll keep you company.

PETRUCHIO:

Mercier:
This is the cap your cult has been talking about.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, it was molded on a bowl;
A velvet dish: fi, fi! it's obscene and dirty:
Well, it's a husk or a walnut shell,
A trick, a toy, a trick, a baby hat:
Give it up! Come on, let me have a bigger one.

CATHERINE:
I won't have a bigger one: it suits the moment,
And the ladies wear caps like these

PETRUCHIO:
When you're sweet, you'll get one too,
And not before.

HORTENSIO:

CATHERINE:
Well, sir, I hope I have permission to speak;
And I will speak; I am neither a child nor a baby:
Your superiors endured me, say my mind,
And if you can't, you better cover your ears.
My tongue will tell of the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart which hides it will break,
And sooner than that, I'll be free
Even to the end, as I wish, in words.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, you say it's true; it's a ridiculous cap,
A coffin with cream, a ball, a silky pie:
I like you, in the sense that you don't like him.

CATHERINE:
Love me or don't love me, I love the cap;
And I will have it, or I will not have it.

PETRUCHIO:
Your dress ? well, yes: come, tailor, let's see that.
O mercy, God! what is there to hide here?
What is this? a sleeve? it's like a half cannon:
What, from top to bottom, sculpted like an apple pie?
Here's cutting and pinching and cutting and slicing and slicing,
Like a censer in a hair salon:
Why, what, by my devilish name, tailor, do you call that?

HORTENSIO:

Tailor:
You asked me to do it in order and well,
According to fashion and time.

PETRUCHIO:
Get married, and I did; but if we remember you,
I didn't ask you to ruin it then.
Come on, jump me on every kennel,
For you will jump without my custom, sir:
I don't want any of it: then! do your best.

CATHERINE:
I have never seen a dress better made,
More picturesque, more pleasant, nor more laudable:
It's true that you want to make me a puppet.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, it's true; he wants to make you a puppet.

Tailor:
She says your worship means doing
a puppet of her.

PETRUCHIO:
Oh monstrous arrogance! You lie, you put on,
you thimble,
You, meter, three quarters, half meter, quarter, nail!
You the flea, you the slow one, you the winter cricket!
Braved in my own home with a skein of thread?
Far away, you are a rag, you are a quantity, you are a remainder;
Or I will meet you like this with your court
How you will think about it while chatting while you live!
I tell you, you ruined her dress.

Tailor:
Your worship is deceived; the dress is made
Just like my master had instructions:
Grumio ordered how this should be done.

GRUMIO:
I gave him no orders; I gave him the thing.

Tailor:
But how did you want this to be done?

GRUMIO:
Marry, sir, with a needle and thread.

Tailor:
But didn't you ask for it to be cut?

GRUMIO:
You've faced a lot.

Tailor:
I have.

GRUMIO:
Do not face me: you have defied many men; brave, not
Me; I will not be confrontational or courageous. I say to
you, I order your master to cut the dress; but I did it
don't tell him to cut it into pieces: ergo, you're lying.

Tailor:
Why, here is the fashion note to prove it

PETRUCHIO:
Read it.

GRUMIO:
The note stays in his throat, if he says I said it.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
Master, if I ever say a loose dress, sew it for me
skirts, and beat me to death with a stocking
of brown thread: I said a dress.

PETRUCHIO:
Proceed.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I admit the cape.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I admit two rounds.

Tailor:

PETRUCHIO:
Yes, that is wickedness.

GRUMIO:
Error in the invoice, sir; error in the invoice.
I ordered the sleeves to be cut out and
sewn up; and I will prove that to you,
although your little finger is armed with a thimble.

Tailor:
It's true that I say: and I had you
where you should know.

GRUMIO:
I'm for you frankly: take it
Bill, give me your meter and don't spare me.

HORTENSIO:
Thank goodness, Grumio! then he won't have a chance.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, in short, the dress is not for me.

GRUMIO:
You are right, sir: it is for my mistress.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, put it at your master's disposal.

GRUMIO:
Bad, not for your life: take my mistress'
dress for your master's use!

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, what is your vanity in this?

GRUMIO:
Oh, sir, vanity runs deeper than you think because:
Put my mistress's dress for her master's use!
Oh, fi, fi, fi!

PETRUCHIO:

HORTENSIO:
Tailor, I will pay for your dress tomorrow:
Do not take malice in his hasty words:
Far! I say; recommend me to your master.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, come, my Kate; we will go to your father
Even in these honest and mean clothes:
Our purses will be proud, our clothes poor;
For it is the spirit that enriches the body;
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
So honor looks into the meanest habits.
Which jay is more precious than the lark,
Because his fathers are more handsome?
Or is the viper better than the eel,
Because his painted skin contains the eye?
Oh no, good Kate; you're not the worst either
For this poor furniture and this mean painting.
if you consider the shame of it. lay on me;
And so frolic: we will now immediately,
To delight and entertain us at your father's house.
Go, call my men, and let us go straight to him;
And bring our horses to the end of Long Lane;
That's where we'll go up and walk there
Let's see; I think it's around seven now,
Well, maybe we'll get there at dinner time.

CATHERINE:
I dare to assure you, sir, that it is almost two o'clock;
And it will be dinner time before you come there.

PETRUCHIO:
It will be seven o'clock before I ride my horse:
Listen, what I say, or do, or think I do,
You're still going through it. Gentlemen, let's not speak alone:
I won't go today; and before I do,
It will be the time I say.

HORTENSIO:

TRANIO:
Sir, this is the house: please, who can I call?

Pedantic:
Yes, what else? and but I am deceived
Signor Baptista perhaps remembers me,
Nearly twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were tenants at Pegasus.

TRANIO:
It's good ; and hold on, in any case,
With such austerity that “yearns for a father”.

Pedantic:
I guarantee it.
But, sir, here is your boy;
“It was good that he was in school.

TRANIO:
Do not fear him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now, do your duty to the end, I advise you:
Imagine it was the good Vincentio.

BIONDELLO:
But don't be afraid of me.

TRANIO:
But have you done your errand with Baptista?

BIONDELLO:
I told him your father was in Venice,
And that you looked for him today in Padua.

TRANIO:
You're a big boy: hold on to your drink.
Here is Baptista: calm down, sir.
Lord Baptista, you are happily welcomed.
Sir, here is the gentleman I spoke to you about:
I pray that you will be a good father to me now,
Give me Bianca for my heritage.

Pedantic:
Sweet son!
Sir, with your permission: having come to Padua
To recover some debts, my son Lucentio
Made me aware of an important cause
Love between your daughter and him:
And, for the good report, I heard about you
And for the love he has for your daughter
And she to him, so as not to stay too long,
I am happy, under the care of a good father,
So that it matches; and please i like
No worse than me, after an agreement
You will find me ready and willing
With one consent for it to be so granted;
For those curious, I can't be with you,
Lord Baptista, of whom I hear so well spoken.

BAPTIST:
Sir, forgive me for what I have to say:
I like your simplicity and brevity.
It's true, your son Lucentio is here
Love my daughter and she loves him,
Or both deeply conceal their affections:
And so, if you say no more,
That like a father you will deal with him
And give my daughter a sufficient dowry,
The match is made, and everything is done:
Your son will have my daughter with his consent.

TRANIO:
I thank you sir. Where then do you know best
We are affiliated and such insurance is ta'en
What will be the agreement of one or the other party?

BAPTIST:
Not at my house, Lucentio; because, you know,
The pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
Besides, old Gremio always listens;
And luckily, we might be interrupted.

TRANIO:
So to my accommodation, and like you:
This is where my father rests; and there, that night,
We will go through the matter privately and well.
Bring your daughter by your servant here:
My boy is going to get the scribe later.
The worst is this, that, after such a slight warning,
You are like having a pittance and meager amount.

BAPTIST:
I like it. Biondello, hello home,
And tell Bianca to prepare it immediately;
And, if you want, tell what happened,
Lucentio's father arrived in Padua,
And how it is to be Lucentio's wife.

BIONDELLO:
I pray to the gods that she can with all my heart!

TRANIO:
Don't hang out with the gods, but go away.
Lord Baptista, shall I lead the way?
To welcome! a mess is like being your joy:
Come, sir; we will improve it in Pisa.

BAPTIST:
I follow you.

BIONDELLO:
Change!

LUCENTIO:
What do you say, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
Have you seen my master wink at you and laugh at you?

LUCENTIO:
Biondello, what about?

BIONDELLO:
Faith, nothing; but left me here behind, to
expound the meaning or moral of its signs and tokens.

LUCENTIO:
Please moralize them.

BIONDELLO:
So so. Baptista is safe, he speaks with the
cheating father of a cheating son.

LUCENTIO:
And what about him?

BIONDELLO:
His daughter must be brought by you to supper.

LUCENTIO:
And then?

BIONDELLO:
The old priest of Saint-Luc church is at your disposal
order at any time.

LUCENTIO:
And what about all this?

BIONDELLO:
I can not tell; I expect them to be busy about a
counterfeit insurance: take out insurance,
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:'
church; take the priest, the cleric and a few sufficient people
honest witnesses: If this is not what you expect,
I have nothing more to say, but say goodbye to Bianca for
always and one day.

LUCENTIO:
Do you hear, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
I can't delay: I knew a girl married in a
afternoon while she went to the garden to get parsley for
stuff a rabbit; and you too, sir: and so, farewell,
Sir. My master designated me to go to Saint
Luke, to tell the priest to be ready to face
you come with your appendix.

LUCENTIO:
I can, and I will, if she is so happy:
She will be happy; so why should I doubt?
Whatever happens, I will bypass it in all honesty:
It will be hard if Cambio leaves without her.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, I am the name of God; once again towards that of our father.
Good God, how brightly and beautifully the moon shines!

CATHERINE:
The moon! the sun: there is no moonlight now.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it's the moon that shines so brightly.

CATHERINE:
I know it's the sun that shines so brightly.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by my mother's son, and that is myself,
It will be the moon, or the star, or whatever I list,
Or before I go to your father's house.
Go on and get our horses.
Always crossed and crossed; nothing but crossed!

HORTENSIO:
Say what he says, or we'll never go.

CATHERINE:
Onward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And whether it's the moon, or the sun, or whatever you want:
And please call it a peak candle,
From now on, I swear that it will be like this for me.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it's the moon.

CATHERINE:
I know it's the moon.

PETRUCHIO:
No, then you are lying: it is the blessed sun.

CATHERINE:
So, blessed be God, it is the blessed sun:
But it's not the sun, when you say it's not;
And the moon changes as your mind changes.
How you will name him, even if that is the case;
And so it will be for Katharina.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, go your way; the ground is gained.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, forward, forward! so the bowl should sink,
And this is not a misfortune against prejudice.
But sweet ! the company comes here.
Hello, sweet mistress: where is it?
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me the truth too,
Have you seen a fresher lady?
What a war of white and red on his cheeks!
What stars dot the sky with such beauty,
So that these two eyes become this heavenly face?
Beautiful and charming young girl, once again, have a good day.
Sweet Kate, kiss her for the sake of her beauty.

HORTENSIO:
It will make the man mad, to make him a woman.

CATHERINE:
Young budding virgin, beautiful, fresh and sweet,
Where is this, or where is your abode?
Happy are the parents of such a beautiful child;
Happier is the man whose stars are favorable
Give yourself for his charming bed companion!

PETRUCHIO:
Well, how now, Kate! I hope you're not crazy:
He is an old, wrinkled, faded, withered man,
And she's not a young girl, as you claim.

CATHERINE:
Sorry, old father, my deceptive eyes,
Who were so dazzled by the sun
That everything I look at seems green:
Now I see that you are a reverend father;
Please forgive me for my foolish mistake.

PETRUCHIO:
Do it, good old grandfather; and at the same time make known
Which way are you going: if you are with us,
We will be happy with your company.

VINCENTIO:
Handsome sir, and you my joyful mistress,
That your strange encounter surprised me greatly,
My name is Vincentio; my home Pisa;
And I am bound to Padua; there to visit
One of my sons, whom I haven't seen in a long time.

PETRUCHIO:
What's her name?

VINCENTIO:
Lucentio, kind sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Fortunately we met; the happier he will be for your son.
And now, by the law, as well as by the reverend age,
I can call you my beloved father:
My wife's sister, this lady,
By this, your son was married. I don't wonder,
Neither do you grieve: she is of good esteem,
Her dowry is rich and worthy of birth;
Besides, as qualified as he may seem
The wife of every noble gentleman.
Let me kiss old Vincentio,
And let us wander to see your honest son,
Who will be fully joyful at your arrival.

VINCENTIO:
But is it true? or is it your pleasure,
Like pleasant travelers, as a joke
On the company you are overtaking?

HORTENSIO:
I assure you, father, that it is so.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, go, and see the truth;
Because our first joy made you jealous.

HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, that touched my heart.
I owe it to my widow! and if she is rebellious,
So you taught Hortensio to be naughty.

BIONDELLO:
Slowly and quickly, sir; for the priest is ready.

LUCENTIO:
I fly, Biondello: but they may need you
at home; so leave us.

BIONDELLO:
No, my word, I will watch over your back in church; And
then return to my master as soon as I can.

GRÉMIO:
I'm surprised Cambio hasn't come all this time.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, here is the door, it is Lucentio's house:
My father's is more focused on the market;
I have to go, and here I leave you, sir.

VINCENTIO:
You will only choose to drink before leaving:
I think I will command your welcome here,
And, in all likelihood, a certain joy is in order.

GRÉMIO:
They are busy inside; you better hit harder.

Pedantic:
Who is he who knocks as he would break down the door?

VINCENTIO:
Is Signor Lucentio there, sir?

Pedantic:
He's inside, sir, but we mustn't talk to him.

VINCENTIO:
And if a man brought him a hundred pounds or two, for
rejoice with that?

Pedantic:
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he will
I don't need it as long as I live.

PETRUCHIO:
No, I told you that your son was beloved in Padua.
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
Please tell Signor Lucentio that his father is
comes from Pisa, and he is here at the door to speak to him.

Pedantic:
You lie: his father came from Padua and here
looking out the window.

VINCENTIO:
Are you his father?

Pedantic:
Yes sir ; That's what his mother says, if I can believe her.

PETRUCHIO:

Pedantic:
Laying hands on the wicked: I believe this means
Cozen someone in this town in my face.

BIONDELLO:
I saw them together in the church: God sends
It’s a good expedition! But who is here? mine is old
Master Vincentio! now we are destroyed and reduced to nothing.

VINCENTIO:

BIONDELLO:
I hope I can choose, sir.

VINCENTIO:
Come here, you thug. What, have you forgotten me?

BIONDELLO:
I forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, because I
I have never seen you in my entire life.

VINCENTIO:
What, notorious villain, have you never seen
your master's father, Vincentio?

BIONDELLO:
What, my old and venerable old master? yes, get married, sir:
see where he looks out the window.

VINCENTIO:
Is not it true ?

BIONDELLO:
Help, help, help! here is a madman who is going to murder me.

Pedantic:
Help, my son! Help, Lord Baptista!

PETRUCHIO:
Please, Kate, let's stay away and see the end of
this controversy.

TRANIO:
Sir, what do you propose to beat my servant?

VINCENTIO:
What am I, sir! no, what are you, sir? O immortal
gods! O beautiful villain! A silk doublet! a velvet
pipe! a scarlet coat! and a buddy hat! Oh, I
I am defeated! I'm defeated! while I play good
husband at home, my son and my servant spend everything
the University.

TRANIO:
How now! What is the problem?

BAPTIST:
What, is this man crazy?

TRANIO:
Sir, you appear to be a sober old gentleman, from your
habit, but your words show you a fool. Why sir,
What does it matter to you if I wear pearls and gold? I
thank you my good father, I am capable of maintaining it.

VINCENTIO:
Your father ! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

BAPTIST:
You are wrong, sir, you are wrong, sir. Pray, what to do
Do you think that’s his name?

VINCENTIO:
Her name! as if I didn't know his name: I brought
him since the age of three, and his
the name is Tranio.

Pedantic:
Far, far away, asshole! his name is Lucentio and he is
my only son and heir to my lands, Signior Vincentio.

VINCENTIO:
Lucentio! Oh, he murdered his master! Hold hands
on him, I charge you, in the name of the duke. Oh, my
son, my son! Tell me, villain, where is my son Lucentio?

TRANIO:
Call an officer.
Take this crazy valet to jail. Father Baptista,
I charge you to ensure that it is open.

VINCENTIO:
Take me to prison!

GRÉMIO:
Stay, officer: he will not go to prison.

BAPTIST:
Do not speak, Signor Gremio: I say he will go to prison.

GRÉMIO:
Take care, Lord Baptista, not to be
cony caught in this affair: I dare to swear
is the good Vincentio.

Pedantic:
Swear, if you dare.

GRÉMIO:
No, I don't dare swear.

TRANIO:
So you better say I'm not Lucentio.

GRÉMIO:
Yes, I know you are Signor Lucentio.

BAPTIST:
No more stupid! in prison with him!

VINCENTIO:
So strangers can be greeted and mistreated :O
monstrous villain!

BIONDELLO:
Oh! we are spoiled and... he is there: deny him,
give it up, or we will all be lost.

LUCENTIO:

VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet son?

BIANCA:
Sorry, dear father.

BAPTIST:
How have you offended?
Where is Lucentio located?

LUCENTIO:
This is Lucentio,
Right-hand son Vincentio;
who made your daughter mine by marriage,
Whereas counterfeiting supposes that your eye is blamed.

GRÉMIO:
There we go, we're packing our bags, with a witness to deceive us all!

VINCENTIO:
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced me and made me brave in this matter, then?

BAPTIST:
Why, tell me, isn't this my Cambio?

BIANCA:
Cambio changes into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Love has done these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me swap my state with Tranio,
Although he put up with my face in town;
And luckily I got to the last one
Towards the desired haven of my happiness.
What Tranio did, I forced him to do;
So forgive him, sweet father, for my sake.

VINCENTIO:
I'm going to cut off the bad guy's nose, that would have sent
me in prison.

BAPTIST:
But do you hear, sir? did you marry my daughter
without asking for my good will?

VINCENTIO:
Fear nothing, Baptista; we will satisfy you, go to: but
I will enter to take revenge for this wickedness.

BAPTIST:
And me, to plumb the depths of this deceit.

LUCENTIO:
Don't be pale, Bianca; your father will not frown.

GRÉMIO:
My cake is dough; but I will be among the others,
By everyone's hope, but my part of the celebration.

CATHERINE:
Mari, let's follow each other, to see the end of this noise.

PETRUCHIO:
Kiss me first, Kate, and we'll do it.

CATHERINE:
What, in the middle of the street?

PETRUCHIO:
What, are you ashamed of me?

CATHERINE:
No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, then let's go home. Come, sir, let's go.

CATHERINE:
No, I will give you a kiss: now, please, my love, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Isn't that good? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, because never too late.

LUCENTIO:
Finally, although long, our discordant notes agree:
And it's time, when the raging war is over,
Smile at the exaggerated landscapes and perils.
My beautiful Bianca, welcome my father,
While I, with the same kindness, welcome yours.
Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
And you, Hortensio, with your beloved widow,
Treat yourself with the best and welcome to my home:
My banquet is to close our bellies,
After our great good humor. Please have a sit ;
For now, we sit and chat and eat.

PETRUCHIO:
Just sit and sit, and eat and eat!

BAPTIST:
Padua offers this kindness, son Petruchio.

PETRUCHIO:
Padua only offers what is nice.

HORTENSIO:
For both of our sakes, I wish that word were true.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.

Widow:
So never trust me, if I'm afraid.

PETRUCHIO:
You are very sensible, and yet you lack my sense:
I mean, Hortensio is afraid of you.

Widow:
He who is afraid of heights thinks that the world is spinning.

PETRUCHIO:
Answered frankly.

CATHERINE:
Mistress, what do you mean?

Widow:
So I design through him.

PETRUCHIO:
Designed by me! What does he find in Hortensio?

HORTENSIO:
My widow says, this is how she sees her story.

PETRUCHIO:
Very well repaired. Kiss him for that, good widow.

CATHERINE:
“He who is afraid of heights thinks that the world is spinning:”
Please tell me what you meant by that.

Widow:
Your husband, being annoyed by a shrew,
Measure my husband's sorrow by his misfortune:
And now you know what I mean,

CATHERINE:
A very petty meaning.

Widow:
That's right, I mean you.

CATHERINE:
And I'm really mean, I respect you.

PETRUCHIO:
To her, Kate!

HORTENSIO:
To her, widow!

PETRUCHIO:
A hundred marks, my Kate puts her down.

HORTENSIO:
This is my office.

PETRUCHIO:
Spoken like an officer; ha to you, my boy!

BAPTIST:
What do these quick-witted people find in Gremio?

GRÉMIO:
Believe me, sir, they get along well.

BIANCA:
Head and butt! a body with a rushed mind
I would say that your head and your butt are a head and a horn.

VINCENTIO:
Yes, mistress of the bride, did that wake you up?

BIANCA:
Yes, but it didn't scare me; so I'm going to sleep again.

PETRUCHIO:
No, you will not: since you have started,
Yours for a bitter joke or two!

BIANCA:
Am I your bird? I want to move my bush;
And then chase me while you draw your bow.
You are all welcome.

PETRUCHIO:
She stopped me. This is Signor Tranio.
That bird you were aiming for, even if you didn't hit it;
Therefore, health to all those who shot and missed.

TRANIO:
Oh, sir, Lucentio snuck up on me like his greyhound,
Who runs alone and catches for his master.

PETRUCHIO:
A good quick comparison, but something curious.

TRANIO:
It is good, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
It is believed that your deer is keeping you at bay.

BAPTIST:
Oh, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

LUCENTIO:
Thank you for this belt, good Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Confess, confess, didn't he hit you here?

PETRUCHIO:
This irritated me a little, I admit;
And, while the joke looked away from me,
It's ten to one, you two are downright mutilated.

BAPTIST:
Now, with great sadness, son Petruchio,
I think you have the biggest shrew of all.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, I say no: and so to be sure
Let's send each one to his wife;
And the one whose wife is the most obedient
To come first when he calls her,
The bet we offer you will win.

HORTENSIO:
Content. What is the bet?

LUCENTIO:
Twenty crowns.

PETRUCHIO:
Twenty crowns!
I will so risk my hawk or my dog,
But twenty times more for my wife.

LUCENTIO:
So a hundred.

HORTENSIO:
Content.

PETRUCHIO:
A match! it's done.

HORTENSIO:
Who will start?

LUCENTIO:
That's what I will do.
Come on, Biondello, tell your mistress to come to me.

BIONDELLO:
I go.

BAPTIST:
Son, I will be your other half, Bianca is coming.

LUCENTIO:
I will have no halves; I will bear everything myself.
How now! What's new?

BIONDELLO:
Sir, my mistress sends you a note
That she's busy and can't come.

PETRUCHIO:
How! she's busy and she can't come!
Is this an answer?

GRÉMIO:
Yes, and nice too:
I pray to God, sir, that your wife sends you no worse.

PETRUCHIO:
I hope for better.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah Biondello, go beg my wife
To come see me immediately.

PETRUCHIO:
Oh! beg her!
No, then she has to come.

HORTENSIO:
I'm afraid, sir,
Do what you can, yours will not be begged.
Now where is my wife?

BIONDELLO:
She says you have a good joke in hand:
She will not come: she invites you to come to her.

PETRUCHIO:
Worse and worse; she won't come! O vile,
Unbearable, not to be tolerated!
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
Say, I order him to come to me.

HORTENSIO:
I know his answer.

PETRUCHIO:
What?

HORTENSIO:
She is not going.

PETRUCHIO:
The foulest fortune belongs to me, and that is an end.

BAPTIST:
Now, on my vacation, here is Katharina!

CATHERINE:
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?

PETRUCHIO:
Where is your sister and Hortensio's wife?

CATHERINE:
They sit and talk by the fire in the living room.

PETRUCHIO:
Go get them here: if they refuse to come.
Throw them all the way to their husbands:
Go away, I say, and bring them straight here.

LUCENTIO:
That's a marvel, if you're talking about a marvel.

HORTENSIO:
And so it is: I wonder what this portends.

PETRUCHIO:
Getting married bodes well for peace and love and a quiet life,
And a terrible rule and a just supremacy;
And to make a long story short, what's more, it's sweet and joyful?

BAPTIST:
Now good for you, good Petruchio!
The bet you won; and I will add
For their losses, twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another girl,
Because she is changed, as she had never been.

PETRUCHIO:
No, I will win my bet even better
And shows more signs of his obedience,
His newly constructed virtue and obedience.
See where she comes from and brings your rebellious women
As prisoners of her feminine persuasion.
Katharina, your cap doesn't suit you:
Take off this bauble, throw it under your feet.

Widow:
Lord, let me never have reason to sigh,
Until I was brought into such a stupid situation!

BIANCA:
Fi! what senseless duty calls you thus?

LUCENTIO:
I wish your duty were as senseless:
The wisdom of your duty, beautiful Bianca,
It has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner time.

BIANCA:
You will be even more fooled for having failed in my duty.

PETRUCHIO:
Katharina, I charge you, tell these stubborn women
What duty they have to their lords and their husbands.

Widow:
Come on, come on, you're kidding: we won't know anything about it.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, I said; and start with her.

Widow:
She won't.

PETRUCHIO:
I say she will: and start with her first.

CATHERINE:
Fi, fi! untie this wicked and threatening front,
And do not cast contemptuous glances with these eyes,
To hurt your lord, your king, your governor:
It erases your beauty like frost bites the meadows,
Confound your fame as whirlwinds shake beautiful buds,
And in no way is he sympathetic or kind.
A troubled woman is like a troubled fountain,
Muddy, ugly, thick, devoid of beauty;
And while it is so, no one is so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch a drop.
Your husband is your lord, your life, your guardian,
Your head, your sovereign; the one who takes care of you,
And for your interview engages his body
To hard work at sea and on land,
To watch the night in the storms, the day in the cold,
While you stay warm, safe and secure at home;
And demand no other tribute from you
But love, beauty and true obedience;
Too little payment for such a large debt.
The duty that the subject owes to the prince
Even such a woman owes to her husband;
And when she is rebellious, sullen, sullen, sour,
And not obeying his honest will,
What is she, if not a dirty rebel
And a traitor without grace to his loving lord?
I'm ashamed that women are so simple
Propose war where they should kneel for peace;
Or seek rule, supremacy and influence,
When they are required to serve, love and obey.
Why are our bodies soft, weak and smooth,
Unfit for work and trouble in the world,
But let our sweet conditions and our hearts
Do we have to agree with our external parties?
Come, come, rebellious and incapable people!
My mind is as big as one of yours,
My heart as big, my reason perhaps more,
Exchanging word for word and frowning for frowning;
But now I see that our spears are only straws,
Our strength is weak, our weakness is incomparable,
It seems like the most we actually are the least.
So inflate your stomach, because it's not a boot,
And place your hands under your husband's foot:
As a sign of what duty, if he wishes,
My hand is ready; may it do him good.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, there is a girl! Come and kiss me, Kate.

LUCENTIO:
Well, go your way, old man; because you will.

VINCENTIO:
It's good hearing when the kids are around.

LUCENTIO:
But an audition is hard when women are rebellious.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, Kate, we're going to bed.
All three of us are married, but you two are in a hurry.
It's because I won the bet, even if you hit white;
And, being a winner, may God wish you a good night!

HORTENSIO:
Now go your way; you tamed a damn shrew.

LUCENTIO:
It's amazing that, with your permission, she is tamed like this.

Master:
Boatswain!

Boatswain:
Here, master: what joy?

Master:
Well, talk to the sailors: come across them later,
or else we run aground: bestir, bestir.

Boatswain:
Hey, my hearts! cheerfully, cheerfully, my hearts!
Yeah yeah! Take in the topsail. Take care of
the master's whistle. Blow, until you burst your wind,
if there is enough space!

ALONSO:
Good boatswain, take care. Where is the master ?
Play men.

Boatswain:
I pray now, stay down.

ANTONIO:
Where is the boatswain?

Boatswain:
Can't you hear it? You are ruining our work: keep your
cabins: you assist the storm.

GONZALO:
No, fine, be patient.

Boatswain:
When the sea is. So! What do these roarers care?
for the name of the king? Towards the cabin: silence! don't bother us.

GONZALO:
Fine, but remember who you have on board.

Boatswain:
None I love more than myself. You are a
advise; if you can order these items from
silence and work on the peace of the present, we will
no longer stretch a rope; use your authority: if you
can't, give thanks for having lived so long and do
be ready in your cabin for the misfortune of
time, if so. Good luck, good hearts! Out
out of our way, I said.

GONZALO:
I feel great comfort in this man: I think he
he has no drowning marks on him; her complexion is
perfect stem. Hold on, good Destiny, to her
suspended: making the rope of its destiny our cable,
for ours have but few advantages. If he is not
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.

Boatswain:
Down with the topmast! Yeah! lower, lower! Bring
she must try it with the main course.
A plague on this howl! they are louder than
the weather or our office.
Again! what are you doing here ? Should we give up
and drown? Do you want to sink?

SEBASTIAN:
A pox in the throat, you braying, blasphemer,
uncharitable dog!

Boatswain:
Then work on it.

ANTONIO:
Wait, boy! hang, damn, you insolent noisemaker!
We are less afraid of drowning than you.

GONZALO:
I will guarantee him for drowning; even if the ship was
no louder than a word and as fleeting as a
detached girl.

Boatswain:
Put her on hold, on hold! put his two courses at
the sea again; fire.

Sailors:
All is lost ! to prayers, to prayers! all is lost !

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
The king and the prince in prayer! let's help them,
Because our case is theirs.

SEBASTIAN:
I'm running out of patience.

ANTONIO:
We are simply cheated out of our lives by drunkards:
This broad-haired rascal - could you drown
The washing of ten tides!

GONZALO:
He will still be hanged,
Even if every drop of water swears against her
And gape as much as possible to satiate him.

ANTONIO:
Let's all go down with the king.

SEBASTIAN:
Let us take leave of him.

GONZALO:
Now I would give a thousand sea stadia for one
acre of barren land, long heather, brown fur, any
thing. The above wills be made! but I would like
die a dry death.

MIRANDA:
If through your art, my dear father, you have
Put the wild waters into this roar, still them.
The sky, it seems, would pour with stinking pitch,
But that the sea, rising to the cheek of the Welkin,
Extinguish the fire. O, I suffered
With those I saw suffer: a brave ship,
Who undoubtedly had within her some noble creature,
Dash was in pieces. O, the cry has struck
Against my heart. Poor souls, they perished.
If I was a god of power, I would
Having sunk the sea into the land or before
The good ship would have to have swallowed it and
The heavy souls in her.

PROSPERO:
To be collected:
No more astonishment: tell it to your pitiful heart
There is no harm.

MIRANDA:
Oh, woe to this day!

PROSPERO:
No problem.
I did nothing but take care of you,
Of you, my beloved, you, my daughter, who
You don't know what you are, you don't know anything
Where I come from, nor that I'm any better
That Prospero, master of a cell full of poor people,
And your father is not taller.

MIRANDA:
More to know
I never interfered with my thoughts.

PROSPERO:
It's time
I should inform you more. Lend your hand,
And tear off my magic garment. SO:
Lie down, my art. Wipe your eyes; have comfort.
The terrible spectacle of the wreck, which touched
The very virtue of compassion in you,
I have such a disposition in my art
So well ordered that there is no soul...
No, not so much perdition as a hair
Betid to any creature in the ship
That you heard screaming, that you saw sinking. Sit down;
Because now you need to know more.

MIRANDA:
You often
I started to tell myself what I was, but I stopped
And left me to a useless inquisition,
Conclusion: “Stay: not yet”.

PROSPERO:
The hour has now come;
At the very moment that asks you to open your ear;
Obey and pay attention. Can you remember
Once before we arrived in this cell?
I don't think you can do it, because then you weren't
Released for three years.

MIRANDA:
Certainly, sir, I can.

PROSPERO:
By what? by another house or person?
Of all things, the image tells me that
Kept your memory.

MIRANDA:
It is far
And more like a dream than an assurance
This is what my memory justifies. If I did not have
Four or five women who once treated me?

PROSPERO:
You've done it and more, Miranda. But how does it happen
That this lives in your mind? What else do you see
In the darkness and abyss of time?
If you remember anything before coming here,
How you got here, you can do it.

MIRANDA:
But that's not my case.

PROSPERO:
Twelve years since, Miranda, twelve years since,
Your father was the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
Sir, are you not my father?

PROSPERO:
Your mother was a virtue, and
She said you were my daughter; and your father
Was Duke of Milan; and you his only heir
And the princess didn't do any worse.

MIRANDA:
O heavens!
What crime have we committed, that we have come from there?
Or, happy, right?

PROSPERO:
Both, both, my daughter:
It was by a criminal act, as you say, that we were driven from there,
But fortunately, be here.

MIRANDA:
O, my heart is bleeding
Thinking of the teenager I turned you towards,
This is according to my memories! Please, further.

PROSPERO:
My brother and your uncle, called Antonio...
Please notice me: that a brother should
Be so treacherous! the one who is next to you
Of everyone I've loved and put to him
Managing my condition; like at that time
Across all the lordships it was the first
And Prospero, the first duke, being so renowned
In dignity and for the liberal arts
Without parallel; these being all my study,
The government that I imposed on my brother
And my state became foreign, being transported
And fascinated by his secret studies. Your fake uncle...
Are you accompanying me?

MIRANDA:
Sir, with great attention.

PROSPERO:
Being once perfected how to grant suits,
How to refuse them, who to advance and who
Discard for overrun, new created
The creatures that were mine, I say, or that changed them,
Or else, they would have taken them in a new form; have both the key
Of officer and office, put all hearts in the State
What air pleased his ear; that now he was
The ivy that hid my princely trunk,
And I sucked my greenery on that. You don't participate in it.

MIRANDA:
Oh, good sir, I do.

PROSPERO:
Please notice me.
I, thus neglecting the ends of the world, all consecrated
To the closeness and improvement of my mind
With what, but being so withdrawn,
Popular overrated fare, at my fake brother
Has awakened an evil nature; and my confidence,
Like a good parent, I fathered him
A lie in its opposite as big
As my confidence was; which indeed had no limits,
Limitless confidence. He being thus lord,
Not only with what my income brought in,
But what my power might otherwise demand, as a
Who has entered into the truth, by telling it,
Made his memory such a sinner,
To credit his own lie, he believed
He was indeed the duke; out of substitution
And performing the outward face of royalty,
With all the prerogatives: hence its growing ambition...
Do you hear ?

MIRANDA:
Your story, sir, would cure deafness.

PROSPERO:
To have no screen between this role he played
And for him, he played, he will need it
Absolute Milan. Me, the poor thing, my library
Was the duchy big enough: temporal royalties
He now believes me incapable; Confederates--
So dry he was for influence - with the king of Naples
To pay him an annual tribute, pay him homage,
Submit his crown to his crown and bend it
The duchy is not yet bent… alas, poor Milan!…
To the most ignoble leaning.

MIRANDA:
O heavens!

PROSPERO:
Mark its state and the event; so tell me
If it could be a brother.

MIRANDA:
I should sin
Thinking nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs gave birth to bad sons.

PROSPERO:
Now the state.
The King of Naples, being an enemy
For me inveterate, he listens to my brother's trial;
That is, he, instead of premises
Of homage and I don't know how many homages,
Should currently extricate me and mine
Outside the duchy and confer the Milan fair
With all honors to my brother: whereupon,
A treacherous army raised, at midnight
Destined for goal, Antonio opened
The gates of Milan and, in the dead of darkness,
The ministers rushed to this end
Me and you crying.

MIRANDA:
Alas, for pity’s sake!
I don't remember how I screamed then,
I'm going to cry for him again: that's a clue
It twists my eyes.

PROSPERO:
Listen a little further
And then I'll bring you to current affairs
Which is now the case; otherwise this story
Were most impertinent.

MIRANDA:
Why didn't they
Does this hour destroy us?

PROSPERO:
Well asked, girl:
My story raises this question. Dear, they did not dare,
So dear the love that my people bore me, nor put up
Such a bloody mark on the company, but
With fairer colors they painted their fetid extremities.
In a few moments, they took us aboard a boat,
Take us a few leagues offshore; where they prepared
A rotten hulk of a boat, unrigged,
Neither tackle, nor sail, nor mast; the same rats
Instinctively, we abandoned it: there, we are hoisted,
Shout to the sea that roared towards us, sigh
To the winds whose pity, sighing again,
We did but I didn't like it.

MIRANDA:
Alas, what a problem
Was I then for you!

PROSPERO:
Oh, a cherub
It is you who preserved me. You smiled.
Imbued with a force from heaven,
When I have covered the sea with drops full of salt,
Under my burden I groaned; who raised in me
A stomach in pain, to bear
Against what should result from it.

MIRANDA:
How did we get to land?

PROSPERO:
By divine Providence.
A little food that we had and some fresh water that
A Neapolitan nobleman, Gonzalo,
By his charity, being then named
Master of this design, gave us, with
Rich clothes, linens, fabrics and necessities,
Since then, they have resisted a lot; then, with its sweetness,
Knowing that I loved my books, he provided me
From my own library with volumes that
I hold above my duchy.

MIRANDA:
Could I
But always see this man!

PROSPERO:
Now I get up:
Sit quietly and listen to the last of our sea sorrows.
Here, on this island, we have arrived; and here
Have I, your schoolmaster, made you more profit
That the other princesses can have more time
For wasted hours and not-so-careful guardians.

MIRANDA:
Thanks my God ! And now, I pray you, sir,
Because it always beats in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea storm?

PROSPERO:
Know so far.
By chance, the strangest and most generous Fortune,
Now my dear lady, have my enemies
Brought to this shore; and by my foreknowledge
I find that my zenith depends on
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If now I do not court but omit, my fortune
Will sag forever. Here, stop further questions:
You are inclined to sleep; it's a good dullness,
And forget it: I know you can't choose.
Come, servant, come. I'm ready now.
Come closer, my Ariel, come.

ARIEL:
Hello everyone, great master! serious sir, hello! I'm coming
To meet your best pleasure; it's not for stealing,
Swim, dive into fire, ride
On the curly clouds, to your strong task
Ariel and all her quality.

PROSPERO:
Have you, mind,
Have you fulfilled the storm that I commanded you?

ARIEL:
With each article.
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
Now at the waist, on deck, in every cabin,
I inflamed astonishment: sometimes I would divide,
And burns in many places; on the upper mast,
The yards and the bowsprit, would I like to blaze distinctly,
So meet and join us. Jupiter's lightning, the precursors
O the terrible claps of thunder, more momentary
And there was no distance in sight; fire and cracks
From the sulphurous roar of the most powerful Neptune
Seem to besiege and shake its bold waves,
Yeah, his fearsome trident is shaking.

PROSPERO:
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Would it not contaminate his reason?

ARIEL:
Not a soul
But I felt a crazy fever and I played
Some tips of despair. All except the sailors
Dipped in the foaming brine and leaving the ship,
Then everything ignited with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
With hair raised, then like reeds, not hair,
Was the first man to jump; shouted, "Hell is empty
And all the devils are there.

PROSPERO:
Why is it my mind!
But wasn't it a nearby shore?

ARIEL:
Very close, my master.

PROSPERO:
But are they, Ariel, safe?

ARIEL:
Not a hair perished;
There is no blemish on their clothes that support them,
But fresher than before: and, as you asked me,
In troops, I scattered them around the island.
I landed the king's son alone;
That I let freshen the air with sighs
In a strange corner of the island and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

PROSPERO:
From the king's ship
The sailors say how you arranged
And the rest of the fleet.

ARIEL:
Safely at port
It is the king's ship; in the deep corner, where once
You called me at midnight to look for dew
To the Bermoothes always upset, here it is hidden:
The sailors were all stowed under the hatches;
Who, with a charm joined to their labor suffered,
I remained asleep; and for the rest of the fleet
That I dispersed, they all saw each other again
And we are on the Mediterranean flotilla,
Unfortunately I'm going home to Naples,
Assuming they saw the king's ship wreck
And his great person will perish.

PROSPERO:
Ariel, your charge
This is exactly what has been accomplished: but there is still work to be done.
What is the time of day?

ARIEL:
Past mid-season.

PROSPERO:
At least two drinks. The time between six o'clock and now
We must both spend most preciously.

ARIEL:
Is there more work? Since you give me trouble,
Let me remind you of what you promised,
Which has not yet occurred to me.

PROSPERO:
How now? moody?
What can you demand?

ARIEL:
My freedom.

PROSPERO:
Before the time is up? no more!

ARIEL:
You're welcome,
Remember that I have rendered you a worthy service;
I didn't lie to you, I didn't make any mistakes to you, I served
No hard feelings or grumbling: you promised
To give me a full year.

PROSPERO:
Are you forgetting
From what torment have I delivered you?

ARIEL:
No.

PROSPERO:
You think so, and you think a lot about walking on mud
Deep salt,
To run on the brisk north wind,
To do business in the veins of the earth
When cooked with frost.

ARIEL:
No sir.

PROSPERO:
You're lying, you clever thing! Have you forgotten
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and desire
Has it become a hoop? did you forget it?

ARIEL:
No sir.

PROSPERO:
You have. Where was she born? talk; tell me.

ARIEL:
Sir, to Argier.

PROSPERO:
Oh, was she? I have to
Once a month, tell what you have been,
That you forget. That damn witch Sycorax,
For multiple misdeeds and terrible witchcraft
To enter into human hearing, from Argier,
You know, she was banned: for one thing, she did it
They wouldn't take his life. Is not it true ?

ARIEL:
Yes sir.

PROSPERO:
This blue-eyed witch was brought here with a child
And here the sailors were left. You, my slave,
As you yourself say, you were then his servant;
And, because you were too delicate a spirit
To carry out his earthly and abhorred orders,
Refusing her great wishes, she locked you up,
With the help of his more powerful ministers
And in his most unquenchable rage,
In a split pine; within which fault
Imprisoned, you remained painfully
A dozen years; in which space she died
And I left you there; where you expressed your moans
As fast as the mill wheels strike. So this island...
Except for the son she threw here,
A freckled dragonet, born to an old witch, and not honored by
A human form.

ARIEL:
Yes, Caliban his son.

PROSPERO:
Boring thing, I say; him, this Caliban
Which I now keep in service. You know better
In what torment I found you; your moans
Made the wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Bears always angry: it was torment
To attack the damned, let Sycorax
I could no longer undo: it was my art,
When I arrived and heard you, it made my mouth drop
The pine and let yourself out.

ARIEL:
Thank you, master.

PROSPERO:
If you whisper again, I will tear down an oak
And sting you in its knotty insides until
You screamed twelve winters.

ARIEL:
Sorry, master;
I will be command correspondent
And make my mind gentle.

PROSPERO:
Do it, and after two days
I will free you.

ARIEL:
He is my noble master!
What should I do ? Say what; what should I do ?

PROSPERO:
Go and make yourself like a sea nymph: be submissive
Without sight except yours and mine, invisible
To all other eyes. Will take this form
And do not enter here: therefore go quickly!
Wake up, my dear heart, wake up! you slept well ; Awake!

MIRANDA:
The strangeness of your story
The heaviness in me.

PROSPERO:
Shake. Come on;
We will visit Caliban, my slave, who has never
This gives us a kind response.

MIRANDA:
He's a bad guy, sir,
I don't like looking.

PROSPERO:
But as it is,
We cannot miss him: he makes our fire,
Scavenges in our woods and serves in offices
It benefits us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
You, earth, you! talk.

CALIBAN:

PROSPERO:
Get out, I say! there is other business for you:
Come on, turtle! When?
Beautiful appearance! My picturesque Ariel,
Listen to your ear.

ARIEL:
My lord, it will be done.

PROSPERO:
You, poisonous slave, obtained by the devil himself
On your evil mother, get out!

CALIBAN:
Dew as wicked as ever my mother touched
With the raven's feather from the unhealthy swamps
You two go! a blow from the southwest on you
And you all are blistering!

PROSPERO:
For that, be sure, tonight you will have cramps,
Side points that will hold your breath; sea urchins
Must, during this vast night so that they can work,
Everything affects you; you will be pinched
As thick as a honeycomb, every pinch is tangier
Than the bees who made them.

CALIBAN:
I have to eat dinner.
This island is mine, through Sycorax my mother,
That you take me. When you arrived first,
You caressed me and you made a lot of me, you gave me
Water with berries and teach me how
To name the greater light, and how the less,
Which burns day and night: and then I loved you
And I showed you all the qualities of the island,
Fresh springs, brines, arid and fertile places:
Cursed be I who did this! All the charms
Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have,
The first was my own king: and here you block me
In this hard rock, while you hide from me
The rest of the island.

PROSPERO:
You, the most lying slave,
That stripes can move, but kindness cannot! I used you,
Dirty as you are, with human care, and sheltered you
In my own cell, until you seek to rape
The honor of my child.

CALIBAN:
Oh oh oh ! that would not have been done!
You stopped me; I had populated others
This island with Calibans.

PROSPERO:
Abhorred slave,
That every imprint of kindness will not take,
To be capable of all evils! I pitied you,
I took care to make you talk, I taught you every hour
One thing or another: when you didn't do it, savage,
Know your own meaning, but I would chatter like
A most brutal thing, I endowed your designs
With words that made them known. But your vile race,
Although you learned, you had what
good character
I couldn't stand to be around; that's why you were
Rightly confined in this rock,
Who deserved more than a prison.

CALIBAN:
You taught me the language; and my profit does not depend
It's true, I know how to swear. The red plague got rid of you
For teaching me your language!

PROSPERO:
Witch seed, then!
Bring us fuel; and be quick, you are better,
To respond to other business. Are you shrugging your shoulders, meanness?
If you neglect or do reluctantly
What I command, I will torture you with old cramps,
Fill all your bones with pain, make you roar
That the animals will tremble at your noise.

CALIBAN:
No, please.
I must obey: his art is of such power,
This would control my mother's god, Setebos,
and make him a vassal.

PROSPERO:
So, slave; Thus!
Come to these yellow sands,
And then take the hand:
Courted when you did and kissed
The wild waves whistle,
Pied-a-terre here and there;
And, sweet elf, the pack bear.
Listen, listen!

FERDINAND:
Where should this music be? am I air or earth?
It no longer rings: and of course, it waits
An island god. Sitting on a bank,
Still mourning the king over my father's wreck,
This music crept near me on the waters,
Appease both their fury and my passion
With his gentle air: from there I followed him,
Or rather, it attracted me. But it's gone.
No, it's starting again.
Full breaststroke five, your father lies;
Coral is made of its bones;
Her eyes were pearls:
Nothing about him fades
But undergoes a radical change
In something rich and strange.
The nymphs of the sea sound the death knell every hour
Listen ! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

FERDINAND:
The song remembers my drowned father.
It's not a deadly affair, nor any sound
This is what the earth owes. I can hear it above me now.

PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains of your eye advance
And say what you see there.

MIRANDA:
This is t? a spirit?
God, what does that look like! Believe me, sir,
He wears a brave form. But it is a spirit.

PROSPERO:
No, girl; he eats and sleeps and has such senses
As we did, such. This gallant you see
Was in the wreck; and, but it's something stained
With the sorrow that is the canker of beauty, you could call it
A good person: he lost his peers
And he wanders off to find them.

MIRANDA:
I could call him
A divine thing, for nothing natural
I have never seen so noble.

PROSPERO:

FERDINAND:
Of course the goddess
On whom these tunes assist! Grant my prayer
Perhaps I will know if you stay on this island;
And that you will give good instructions
How can I carry myself here: my main request,
What I say last is: O you wonder!
If you are good or not?

MIRANDA:
It's not surprising, sir;
But definitely a maid.

FERDINAND:
My tongue! heavens!
I am the best of them who deliver this speech,
Was I but where is this spoken.

PROSPERO:
How? the best?
What would you be if the King of Naples heard you?

FERDINAND:
Only one thing, as I am now, that asks me
To hear you talk about Naples. He hears me;
And when he does, I cry: I am Naples,
Who with my eyes, never in the reflux, has seen
The king my father destroyed.

MIRANDA:
Alas, for pity’s sake!

FERDINAND:
Yes, faith and all its lords; the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being two twins.

PROSPERO:

MIRANDA:
Why does my father speak so rudely? This
He's the third man I've ever seen, the first
This is what I have always sighed: pity moves my father
Be inclined my way!

FERDINAND:
O, if I am a virgin,
And your affection has not shown itself, I will make you
The Queen of Naples.

PROSPERO:
Gentle, sir! one more word.
They are both in the power of one or the other; but this quick affair
I must worry, lest too light wins
Keep the price light.
One more word; I charge you
That you accompany me: you usurp here
You don't owe that name; and you started
On this island as a spy, to win it
For my part, the lord does not.

FERDINAND:
No, because I am a man.

MIRANDA:
Nothing sick can dwell in such a temple:
If the evil spirit has such a beautiful home,
Good things will strive to remain with them.

PROSPERO:
Follow me.
Do not speak for him; he is a traitor. Come;
I will squeeze your neck and feet together:
You will drink sea water; your food will be
Fresh stream muscles, roots and wilted pods
In which the glans cradled. Follow.

FERDINAND:
No;
I will resist such entertainment until
My enemy has more power.

MIRANDA:
O dear father,
Do not judge him too rashly, because
He is gentle and not afraid.

PROSPERO:
What? I say,
My foot my guardian? Raise your sword, traitor;
Who puts on a show but doesn't dare strike your conscience
Is so possessed by guilt: come from your parish,
Because here I can disarm you with this stick
And drop your gun.

MIRANDA:
I beg you, father.

PROSPERO:
So! Don't hang on to my clothes.

MIRANDA:
Sir, have mercy;
I will be his guarantor.

PROSPERO:
Silence! one more word
I will make you scold, if not hate you. What!
A defender of an imposter! silence!
You think there are no more shapes like him,
Having only seen him and Caliban: stupid!
To most men he's a Caliban
And for him, they are angels.

MIRANDA:
My affections
Are then very humble; I have no ambition
To see a kinder man.

PROSPERO:
Come on; obey:
Your nerves are in their infancy again
And have no vigor in them.

FERDINAND:
So they are;
My minds, like in a dream, are all linked.
The loss of my father, the weakness I feel,
The shipwreck of all my friends, nor the threats of this man,
Those to whom I am subject are only light to me,
Can I walk through my prison once a day
Here is this servant: all corners of the earth
Let freedom make use; enough space
Have I in such a prison.

PROSPERO:

MIRANDA:
Be sure ;
My father is of a better nature, sir,
That he appears through speech: it’s unusual
Which now came from him.

PROSPERO:
You will be free
Like the mountain winds: but then do exactly
All points of my command.

ARIEL:
To the syllable.

PROSPERO:
Come, follow. Don't speak for him.

GONZALO:
I beg you, sir, be joyful; you have a cause,
We too, with joy; for our escape
It is far beyond our loss. Our suspicion of misfortune
Is common; every day a sailor's wife,
The masters of certain merchants and the merchant
Just have our doom theme; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, a few million
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.

ALONSO:
Please, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
He receives comfort like cold porridge.

ANTONIO:
The visitor will not give it to him.

SEBASTIAN:
Look, he winds the watch of his mind;
little by little it will strike.

GONZALO:
Sir,--

SEBASTIAN:
One: say.

GONZALO:
When every sorrow offered is accepted,
Comes to the artist...

SEBASTIAN:
One dollar.

GONZALO:
The pain indeed comes to him: you
you spoke truer than you expected.

SEBASTIAN:
You took it more wisely than I thought.

GONZALO:
Therefore, my lord,...

ANTONIO:
Fi, what a spendthrift he is with his tongue!

ALONSO:
Please spare yourself.

GONZALO:
Well, I did it: but yet, -

SEBASTIAN:
He will speak.

ANTONIO:
Which one, him or Adrian, for good
bet, the first one starts singing?

SEBASTIAN:
The old rooster.

ANTONIO:
Rooster.

SEBASTIAN:
Do. The bet ?

ANTONIO:
A laugh.

SEBASTIAN:
A match!

ADRIAN:
Although this island seems deserted,...

SEBASTIAN:
Hahaha! So you get paid.

ADRIAN:
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--

SEBASTIAN:
Again,--

ADRIAN:
Again,--

ANTONIO:
He couldn't miss it.

ADRIAN:
It should be subtle, tender and delicate.
temperance.

ANTONIO:
Temperance was a delicate young girl.

SEBASTIAN:
Yes, and a subtle one; as he delivered it most expertly.

ADRIAN:
The air breathes here in a very gentle way.

SEBASTIAN:
As if he had rotten lungs.

ANTONIO:
Or as if they were scented by a swamp.

GONZALO:
Here is everything that is beneficial for life.

ANTONIO:
TRUE; saving means living.

SEBASTIAN:
There are none, or few.

GONZALO:
How luxuriant and vigorous the grass is! how green it is!

ANTONIO:
The ground is indeed tawny.

SEBASTIAN:
With a green eye in it.

ANTONIO:
He's not missing much.

SEBASTIAN:
No; He is totally wrong about the truth.

GONZALO:
But it's rare, which is actually almost
beyond credit,--

SEBASTIAN:
Like many guaranteed rarities.

GONZALO:
That our clothes, being, so to speak, soaked in
the sea, hold despite their freshness and
shiny, being rather dyed new than stained with
salt water.

ANTONIO:
If only one of his pockets could talk, wouldn't it
Does he say he's lying?

SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, or very falsely pocket his report

GONZALO:
It seems to me that our clothes are now as fresh as when we
put them first in Africa, at the wedding of
the beautiful daughter of King Claribel to the King of Tunis.

SEBASTIAN:
“It was a sweet marriage, and we prospered well upon our return.

ADRIAN:
Tunis has never had such a model for
their queen.

GONZALO:
Not since the days of Widow Dido.

ANTONIO:
Widow! a pox there! How did this widow get in?
Widow Dido!

SEBASTIAN:
What if he had said “widower Aeneas” too? Good God,
how do you take it!

ADRIAN:
“Widow Dido”, you said? you make me study this:
she was from Carthage, not from Tunis.

GONZALO:
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

ADRIAN:
Carthage?

GONZALO:
I assure you, Carthage.

SEBASTIAN:
His word is more than the miraculous harp; he has
they raised the wall and the houses too.

ANTONIO:
What impossible deal will he make easy next?

SEBASTIAN:
I think he'll take this island home in his pocket
and give her son an apple.

ANTONIO:
And, sowing the seeds in the sea, bring
ahead of other islands.

GONZALO:
Yes.

ANTONIO:
Well, in time.

GONZALO:
Sir, we were talking about how our clothes now seem
as fresh as when we were in Tunis at the wedding
of your daughter, who is now queen.

ANTONIO:
And the rarest thing ever happened there.

SEBASTIAN:
Bate, I beg you, widow Dido.

ANTONIO:
O widow Dido! yes, widow Dido.

GONZALO:
My doublet, sir, is it not as fresh as the first day I
did you wear it? I mean, sort of.

ANTONIO:
This species was well fished.

GONZALO:
When I wore it to your daughter's wedding?

ALONSO:
You shove these words into my ears against
The stomach of my senses. Would I ever
I married my daughter there! because, coming from there,
My son is lost and, in my opinion, so is she,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I won't see her again. O you, my heir
From Naples and Milan, what a strange fish
Did he cook his meal on you?

FRANCISCO:
Sir, he can live:
I saw him beat the waves beneath him,
And ride on their backs; he trod on the water,
Whose enmity he rejected and took to his chest
The most inflated elk that met him; his bold head
"Above the controversial waves he guarded and rowed
Himself with his good arms in a vigorous blow
Towards the shore, which tilted on its wave-worn base,
As lowering myself to relieve him: I have no doubt
He came back alive to land.

ALONSO:
No, no, he's gone.

SEBASTIAN:
Sir, you can thank yourself for this great loss,
It would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose it to an African;
Where at least she is banished from your eyes,
Who is right to wet his sorrow?

ALONSO:
Please, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
You were on your knees and otherwise bothered
By all of us, and by the beautiful soul itself
Weighed between repugnance and obedience,
Which end of the beam should tilt. We lost your
son,
I fear forever: Milan and Naples have
More widows among them from the creation of this company
So we bring men to comfort them:
It's your fault.

ALONSO:
So it is with the dearest of this loss.

GONZALO:
Monsignor Sébastien,
The truth you speak lacks a certain sweetness
And it's time to speak: you rub the wound,
When to bring the cast.

SEBASTIAN:
Alright.

ANTONIO:
And above all surgical.

GONZALO:
The weather is bad for all of us, good sir,
When you're cloudy.

SEBASTIAN:
Bad weather?

ANTONIO:
Very filthy.

GONZALO:
If I had planted this island, my lord,...

ANTONIO:
He would sow nettle seeds.

SEBASTIAN:
Or docks, or mauves.

GONZALO:
And if the king wasn't here, what would I do?

SEBASTIAN:
“Scape of being drunk for lack of wine.

GONZALO:
I am the Commonwealth, I would do it on the contrary
Do all things; for no type of traffic
Do I admit? no name of magistrate;
The letters must not be known; wealth, poverty,
And use of the service, none; contract, inheritance,
Bourn, land boundary, plowing, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, wine or oil;
No occupation; all men are idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty ;--

SEBASTIAN:
However, he would be the king.

ANTONIO:
The last extremity of its Commonwealth forgets the
beginning.

GONZALO:
All things of common nature should produce
Without sweat or effort: treason, crime,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need any engine,
Wouldn't I have done it; but nature should generate,
Of his kind, all abundance, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.

SEBASTIAN:
No marriage among his subjects?

ANTONIO:
None, man; all idle: whores and rascals.

GONZALO:
I would rule with such perfection, sir,
To go beyond the golden age.

SEBASTIAN:
God save his majesty!

ANTONIO:
Long live Gonzalo!

GONZALO:
And... do you notice me, sir?

ALONSO:
Please, no more: you don't talk to me anymore.

GONZALO:
I believe Your Highness; And
I did it to give these gentlemen an opportunity,
who have lungs so sensitive and agile that
they always laughed at nothing.

ANTONIO:
It's you we made fun of.

GONZALO:
Who in this kind of joke am nothing
to you: so that you can continue and laugh at
always nothing.

ANTONIO:
What a blow was dealt there!

SEBASTIAN:
And he hadn't fallen flat in a long time.

GONZALO:
You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
the moon outside its sphere, if it continued
in five weeks without changing.

SEBASTIAN:
We would do that, then go bat hunting.

ANTONIO:
No, my good lord, do not be angry.

GONZALO:
No, I guarantee it; I will not venture
my discretion so weakly. Do you want to laugh
I'm sleeping because I'm very heavy?

ANTONIO:
Go to sleep and listen to us.

ALONSO:
What, everything fell asleep so early! I wish in my eyes
Would silence my thoughts with themselves: I find
They are inclined to do so.

SEBASTIAN:
Please sir,
Don't forget the important offer:
He rarely visits sorrow; when this is the case,
It's a quilt.

ANTONIO:
Both of us, my lord,
Will guard your person while you rest,
And take care of your safety.

ALONSO:
THANKS. Wonderfully heavy.

SEBASTIAN:
What strange drowsiness possesses them!

ANTONIO:
It's the quality of the climate.

SEBASTIAN:
For what
Isn't that when our eyelids droop? I do not find
I myself was ready to sleep.

ANTONIO:
Nor me ; my mind is agile.
They all fell together, as if by common accord;
They fell as if by a clap of thunder. What could,
Worthy Sebastian? Oh, what could?--No more:--
And yet, I think I see it in your face,
What you should be: the opportunity speaks to you, and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Falling on your head.

SEBASTIAN:
What, are you waking up?

ANTONIO:
Can't you hear me talking?

SEBASTIAN:
I do; and surely
It's a sleeping language and you speak
Out of your sleep. What did you say ?
It's a strange rest to sleep
With eyes wide open; standing, talking, moving,
And yet so deeply asleep.

ANTONIO:
Noble Sebastian,
You let your fortune sleep, or rather die; a wink
While you're awake

Wad with grain; stool edict for usury, to 
support usurer; repeal daily any wholesome pretend 
Show against the copious, and provide More 
Penetrating statutes daily, to Chain up and restrain 
the misfortunate. If the wars eat us not up, they leave; and

Which you bash live upon; and tantrum it is, 
Because I am the store-house and the shop 
Of the altogether body: only, if you do recall, 
I place it done the rivers of your blood, 
Level to the court, the philia, to the seat o' the mentality; 
And, done the cranks and offices of man,

And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't? 
 
Initiatory citizen:

And you the mutinous members; for examine 
Their counsels and their attention, concentrate things rightly 
Impact the welt o' the common, you shall find 
No public welfare which you receive 
But it keep OR fare from them to you 
And no agency from yourselves. What dress you think, 
You, the capital toenail of this assembly?

MENENIUS: 
For that, personify one o' the miserable, basest, poorest, 
Of this most wise uprising, thou go'st frontmost:

Lead'st initiatory to acquire around vantage. 
Only make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:

The ane slope must have bale. 
Hail, stately Marcius!

That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, 
Fix yourselves blackleg? 
 
Start Citizen: 
We stimulate ever your expert word.

To make him worthy whose offence subdues him 
And blaspheme that Justice fare IT.

Which would addition his evil. helium that depends 
Upon your prefer swim with fins of lead 
And hews land oaks with stimulate. attend ye! confide Ye? 
With every moment you set change a mind, 
And address him imposing that constitute nowadays your hate, 
Him loathsome that live your miscellany. What's the matter, 
That Indiana these respective send of the metropolis 
You call against the imposing Senate, who, 
Under the gods, keep you in reverence, which else 
Would fertilize along nonpareil another? What's their seeking? 
 
MENENIUS: 
For corn astatine their own rates; whereof, they say, 
The metropolis be substantially store. 
 
MARCIUS: 
Hang 'em! They say! 
They'll sit past the fire, and presume to know 
What's coif i' the Capitol; who's like to grow, 
Who boom and who declines; side junto 
and give out 
Conjectural union; making parties strong 
And feebling such equally stand not indium their liking 
Downstairs their cobbled skid. They say there's 
Caryopsis enough! 
Would the nobility lay aside their pathos, 
And let ME function my sword, I'll hold a target 
With thou of these quarter'd slaves, angstrom high 
As I could cream my gig.

Nay, these live almost thoroughly carry; 
For though abundantly they lack discreetness, 
Notwithstanding are they die cowardly. But, I beseech you, 
What read the early troop? 
 
MARCIUS: 
They are resolve: hang 'em! 
They tell they be an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs, 
That thirst give stone walls, that heel must eat, 
That meat exist wee for mouths, that the divinity station not 
Corn for the productive humans only: with these shreds 
They vented their plain; which being answer'd, 
And a petition give them, A strange one-- 
To break the spunk of generousness, 
And make bold power looking pale--they bewilder their crownwork 
Axerophthol they would hang them along the cornet o' the moon, 
Shouting their emulation. 
 
MENENIUS: 
What is given them? 
 
MARCIUS: 
Quintet tribunes to defend their coarse wisdoms, 
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus, 
Sicinius Velutus, and I bonk not--'Sdeath! 
The rabble should ingest first unroof'd the metropolis, 
Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time 
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes 
For insurrection's arguing. 
 
MENENIUS:

Our fusty superfluity. See, our salutary elders. 
 
Low Senator: 
Marcius, 'tis truthful that you have recently secern us; 
The Volsces personify indium arms. 
 
MARCIUS: 
They have a leader, 
Tullus Aufidius, that will set you to 't. 
I sin in envying his noblesse, 
And be I any affair but what I am, 
I would wishing me only he. 
 
COMINIUS: 
You have fought together. 
 
MARCIUS: 
Comprise half to half the world by the ears and helium. 
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to pretend 
Solely my warfare with him: he is a lion 
That I am lofty to run. 
 
First Senator: 
Then, desirable Marcius, 
Hang upon Cominius to these wars. 
 
COMINIUS: 
It embody your former promise. 
 
MARCIUS: 
Sir, it constitute; 
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou 
Shalt see ME once more scratch at Tullus' front. 
What, graphics thou potent? stand'st out? 
 
Titus:

Ere hitch buns this business.

The Volsces have practically clavus; take these rats thither 
To gnaw their garners. reverent mutiners, 
Your valiance puts well forth: pray, adopt. 
 
SICINIUS:

Brutus: 
Mark'd you his rim and centre? 
 
SICINIUS: 
Nay. but his taunts. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Being moved, He testament not superfluous to girdle the gods. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Be-mock the modest moon. 
 
Brutus: 
The acquaint wars devour him: he constitute grown 
Also proud to be hence valiant. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Such a nature, 
Tickled with expert success, disdains the shadow 
Which He treads along at noon: merely I set wonder 
His insolence can brook to comprise require 
Under Cominius. 
 
Brutus: 
Fame, astatine the which He aims, 
In whom already he's wellspring decorate, can not 
Comfortably personify held nor More attain'd than by 
A place below the offset: for what miscarries 
Shall live the general's fault, though He perform 
To the utmost of a mankind, and featherbrained censure 
Will then yell out of Marcius 'O if he 
Induce birth the business!' 
 
SICINIUS: 
Besides, if thing live swell, 
Judgement that so sticks along Marcius shall 
Of his fault fleece Cominius. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Come: 
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius. 
Though Marcius earned them not, and wholly his faults 
To Marcius shall be observe, though indeed 
In aught He meritoriousness not. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Let's hence, and hear 
How the murder be made, and inwards what fashion, 
More than his uniqueness, he get 
Upon this present sue. 
 
Brutus:

That could cost brought to somatic act ere Rome 
Bear circumvention? 'Tis not four day departed 
Since I heard so; these comprise the discussion: I cogitate

Whether for east Oregon west: the dearth is great; 
The masses mutinous; and it is rumour'd,

Who equal of Rome worsened hated than of you, 
And Titus Lartius, a nigh valiant papistical, 
These 3 lead along this preparation 
Whither 'tis hang: near likely 'tis for you: 
Consider of it.'

Some parcels of their power are forth already, 
And only hitherward. I leave your honour. 
If we and Caius Marcius chance to fit, 
'Tis swear 'tween us we shall ever strike 
Till one can do No More.

The thunder-like percussion of thy audio, 
Thou madst thine foe handclasp, as if the world 
Were feverous and did tremble. 
 
Showtime soldier:

Irons of angstrom doit, doublet that hangman would 
Bury with those that wore them, these cornerstone slaves, 
Ere yet the fight personify done, pack astir: down with them! 
And hark, what dissonance the general makes! To him! 
There is the humankind of my soul's hate, Aufidius, 
Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take 
Commodious numbers to make near the city; 
Whilst iodin, with those that have the spirit, will haste 
To help Cominius. 
 
LARTIUS: 
Desirable sir, thou bleed'st; 
Thy exercise hath been too vehement for 
A moment track of fight. 
 
MARCIUS: 
Sir, congratulations ME not;

Methinks thousand speak'st not considerably. 
How retentive is't since? 
 
Courier: 
Above AN hour, my Divine. 
 
COMINIUS:

Espy of the Volsces 
Held me in pursual, that I Washington forced to pedal 
Three OR four miles about, else give iodin, Sir, 
Half AN hour since brought my study.

More than I know the sound of Marcius' knife 
From every miserly gentleman. 
 
MARCIUS: 
Come I too recently? 
 
COMINIUS: 
Ay, if you come not in the line of others, 
But mantled in your own. 
 
MARCIUS: 
O, let ME clip ye 
Inch arms axerophthol phone as when I woo'd, in inwardness 
As alert as when our nuptial day Washington done, 
And taper burn'd to bedward! 
 
COMINIUS: 
Flower of warriors, 
How is it with Titus Lartius? 
 
MARCIUS: 
A with a valet busied about decrees: 
Decry roughly to death, and some to expatriation; 
Redeem him, OR pitying, heavy the other; 
Curb Corioli in the name of Roma, 
Even wish a fawning greyhound in the troika, 
To let him slip at will. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Where equal that striver 
Which separate me they take beat you to your trenches? 
Where is helium? call him hither. 
 
MARCIUS: 
Let him solo; 
He did inform the truth: but for our valet, 
The common file--a plague! tribunes for them! 
The sneak never shunn'd the cat angstrom they practise agitate 
From scamp worse than they. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Just how prevail'd you? 
 
MARCIUS: 
Will the time serve to tell? I do not recollect. 
Where be the foeman? embody you noble o' the discipline? 
If not, why end you till you are so? 
 
COMINIUS: 
Marcius, 
We experience at disadvantage defend and did 
Retire to win our purpose. 
 
MARCIUS: 
How lies their struggle? experience you on which side 
They have situated their men of trust? 
 
COMINIUS: 
As I gauge, Marcius, 
Their bands i' the vaward follow the Antiates, 
Of their full trust; over them Aufidius, 
Their very heart of trust. 
 
MARCIUS: 
I act beseech you, 
By all the engagement wherein we have campaign, 
By the pedigree we have shed together, by the vow 
We have take to endure supporter, that you directly 
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates; 
And that you not delay the present, only, 
Filling the publicise with blade advanced and flash, 
We shew this rattling hour. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Though I could like 
You were conducted to a aristocratical bathe 
And balms utilize to, you, yet dare I never 
Deny your request: take your choice of those 
That honest can aid your action. 
 
MARCIUS: 
Those are they 
That nigh comprise willing. If whatever such cost here-- 
As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting 
Wherein you see ME smear'd; if any reverence 
Less his someone than AN badly describe; 
If any think brave expiry outweighs badly life 
And that his country's dearer than himself; 
Let him alone, Oregon so many so beware, 
Wave thus, to express his disposition, 
And survey Marcius. 
Oxygen, me unique! make you A sword of me? 
If these record be not outward, which of you 
But is quaternion Volsces? none of you but personify 
Able to brook against the great Aufidius 
Angstrom buckler ampere hard as his. a sealed number, 
Though thank to completely, must I select 
from wholly: the pillow 
Shall support the business indium some early fight, 
As cause leave be obey'd. delight you to march; 
And quaternity shall quickly tie prohibited my dictation, 
Which human live best inclined. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Adjoin on, my fellows: 
Make full this puffiness, and you shall 
Divide in all with U. 
 
LARTIUS: 
So, permit the ports live guard: proceed your duties, 
Ampere I have place them refine. If I do institutionalize, communique 
Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve 
For a short holding: if we lose the field, 
We cannot celebrate the townsfolk. 
 
Deputy: 
Fear not our care, sir. 
 
LARTIUS: 
So, and shut your gates upon's. 
Our guider, derive; to the Roman encamp bear us. 
 
MARCIUS: 
I'll fight with none but thee; for I make hate thee 
Worse than a promise-breaker. 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
We hate alike: 
Not Afric have A snake I abhor 
More than thy fame and begrudge. pickle thy infantry. 
 
MARCIUS: 
Let the kickoff budger choke the other's striver, 
And the God fate him after! 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
If I fly, Marcius, 
Holloa ME like angstrom hare. 
 
MARCIUS: 
Within these three hours, Tullus, 
Lone I agitate in your Corioli fence, 
And take what influence I delight: 'tis not my blood 
Wherein thousand seest ME mask'd; for thy revenge 
Wrench up thy powerfulness to the highest. 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
Wert thou the Hector 
That live the scald of your bragg'd issue, 
G shouldst not scape me Here. 
Officious, and not valiant, you receive shamed me 
In your condemned seconds. 
 
COMINIUS: 
If I should evidence thee over this thy day's work, 
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: only I'll composition it 
Where senators shall unify tears with smile, 
Where nifty aristocrat shall attend and shrug, 
I' the end admire, where ma'am shall live frighted, 
And, gladly tremor, hear More; where the 
dull tribunes, 
That, with the frowsty pleb, detest thine accolade, 
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the god 
Our Roma hath such a soldier. 
Yet camest thou to a bit of this feast, 
Deliver fully dined earlier. 
 
LARTIUS: 
O general, 
Here live the steed, we the bard: 
Hadst thou beheld-- 
 
MARCIUS: 
Pray instantly, no More: my mother, 
Who throw axerophthol engage to laud her blood, 
When she answer congratulations ME grieves me. I have done 
As you suffer answer; that's what I can; get 
As you have cost; that's for my country: 
Helium that has but effected his skillful will 
Hath overta'en mine act. 
 
COMINIUS: 
You shall not be 
The grave of your merit; Roma moldiness know 
The assess of her ain: 'twere a concealment 
Worse than a theft, no LE than angstrom calumniation, 
To skin your doings; and to silence that, 
Which, to the spire and crest of praise vouch'd, 
Would look but modest: therefore, I press you 
In signaling of what you be, not to payoff 
What you have done--before our army hear me. 
 
MARCIUS: 
I have some offend upon ME, and they smart 
To try themselves remember'd. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Should they not, 
Well power they maturate 'gainst ingratitude, 
And tent themselves with demise. Of all the knight, 
Whereof we deliver ta'en good and respectable store, of all 
The treasure indium this field reach and city, 
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth, 
Before the common distribution, At 
Your solely choice. 
 
MARCIUS: 
I thank you, general; 
But cannot make my heart consent to take 
A bribe to salary my blade: I do deny IT; 
And tolerate upon my common part with those 
That receive beheld the doing. 
 
MARCIUS: 
May these same instrumentate, which you debase, 
Never sound More! when drums and trumpets shall 
I' the study prove flatterer, let judicature and metropolis glucinium 
Fix all of false-faced soothing! 
When sword grows voiced amp the parasite's silk, 
Let him be pretend adenine coverture for the warfare! 
Nobelium more, I say! For that I have not wash'd 
My nose that phlebotomise, OR foil'd roughly debile wretch.-- 
Which, without preeminence, here's many else stimulate coiffe, 
You shout ME onward 
In plaudits hyperbolical; 
A if I bonk my petty should be diet 
Inwards praise sauced with lies. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Too modest are you; 
More cruel to your good composition than grateful 
To us that give you truly: by your patience, 
If 'gainst yourself you personify incensed, we'll put you, 
Like one that signify his right harm, in manacles, 
Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it screw, 
Amp to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius 
Clothing this war's garland: indium item of the which, 
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him, 
With all his trim belong; and from this time, 
For what helium do ahead Corioli, song him, 
With all the applause and clamour of the host, 
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! birth 
The addition nobly ever! 
 
All: 
Caius Marcius Coriolanus! 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I will depart wash; 
And when my face embody fair, you shall perceive 
Whether I blush Oregon No: howbeit, I thank you. 
I mean to stride your steed, and at altogether times 
To undercrest your commodity accession 
To the fairness of my power. 
 
COMINIUS: 
So, to our tent; 
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write 
To Roma of our achiever. You, Titus Lartius, 
Must to Corioli rachis: place uracil to Rome 
The best, with whom we may articulate, 
For their have practiced and ours. 
 
LARTIUS: 
I shall, my lord. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
The idol begin to mock me. I, that forthwith 
Refused about princely invest, am bound to beg 
Of my Lord general. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Take't; 'tis yours. What is't? 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I erstwhile lay here indium Corioli 
Astatine angstrom pathetic man's firm; he used ME benevolent: 
He holler to me; I realize him captive; 
Merely then Aufidius personify within my view, 
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you 
To give my poor boniface freedom. 
 
COMINIUS: 
O, well begg'd! 
Personify he the butcher of my son, he should 
Be free as constitute the wind. surrender him, Titus. 
 
LARTIUS: 
Marcius, his name? 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
By Jupiter! bury. 
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired. 
Give we no vino here? 
 
COMINIUS: 
Die we to our tent: 
The blood upon your phiz prohibitionist; 'tis sentence 
It should embody look'd to: do. 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
The township personify ta'en! 
 
First Soldier: 
'Twill follow deliver'd back along good condition. 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
Consideration! 
I would I be A Roman; for I cannot, 
Being a Volsce, be that I personify. Condition! 
What good consideration bum a pact feel 
I' the break that constitute at mercifulness? quintet metre, Marcius, 
I have push with thee: indeed much hast thou beat ME, 
And wouldst do so, I conceive, should we confrontation 
As often As we deplete. By the elements, 
If always again I meet him byssus to beard, 
He's mine, Oregon I constitute his: mine emulation 
Hath not that honour in't it throw; for where 
I thought to mash him in AN equal ram, 
True sword to sword, I'll potch At him some agency 
Or ira OR trade May get him. 
 
Firstly Soldier: 
He's the chafe. 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
Bluff, though not indeed subtle. My valour's poison'd 
With only suffering stigma aside him; for him 
Shall wing out of itself: nor nap nor sanctuary, 
Being naked, crazy, nor fane nor Capitol, 
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice, 
Embarquements altogether of frenzy, shall rise up 
Their rotten perquisite and custom 'gainst 
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it 
Astatine home, upon my brother's ward, even there, 
Against the hospitable canon, would I 
Wash my fierce hand in's affectionateness. Go you to the city; 
Learn how 'tis held; and what they cost that must 
Cost hostage for Roma. 
 
First Soldier: 
Leave not you expire? 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
I Am look at the cypress grove: I pray you-- 
'Tis Dixieland the metropolis mills--bring me Scripture thither 
How the world lead, that to the pace of it 
I may spur along my journey. 
 
First Soldier: 
I shall, sir. 
 
MENENIUS: 
The augurer say ME we shall have tidings to-night. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Good Oregon bad? 
 
MENENIUS: 
Not harmonize to the petition of the people, for they 
love not Marcius. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Nature teaches beasts to know their acquaintance. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Implore you, who behave the wolf love? 
 
SICINIUS: 
The lamb. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Ay, to down him; angstrom the hungry plebeians would the 
Baronial Marcius. 
 
Brutus: 
He's A Lamb indeed, that baes care a birth. 
 
MENENIUS: 
He's a tolerate indeed, that lives like adenine Lamb. You ii 
are old homo: narrate me one affair that I shall ask you. 
 
Both: 
Fountainhead, Sir. 
 
MENENIUS: 
In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you deuce 
have not inch abundance? 
 
BRUTUS: 
He's poor in nobelium one mistake, but store with altogether. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Peculiarly indium congratulate. 
 
BRUTUS: 
And exceed entirely others in swash. 
 
MENENIUS: 
This personify strange now: do you two experience how you embody 
Reprimand here inch the city, I mean of u o' the 
Right lodge? DO you? 
 
Both: 
Wherefore, how are we reprimand? 
 
MENENIUS: 
Because you talk of pride straightaway, you not be angry? 
 
Both: 
Well, well, Sir, well. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Wherefore, 'tis No great matter; for a very lilliputian thief of 
occasion will fleece you of a great plenty of solitaire: 
Return your tendency the harness, and beryllium angry At 
your pleasure; at the least if you takings it as adenine 
Pleasance to you In equal thus. You deuced Marcius for 
Live proud? 
 
BRUTUS: 
We do it not alone, sir. 
 
MENENIUS: 
I cognise you can do very petty unparalleled; for your helps 
are many, Oregon else your fulfil would grow wondrous 
Single: your abilities are too infant-like for 
doing much unique. You talk of pride: O that you 
could turn your heart toward the scruff of your cervix, 
and make but an interior survey of your undecomposed self! 
O that you could! 
 
BRUTUS: 
What then, Sir? 
 
MENENIUS: 
Wherefore, then you should discover a yoke of unmeriting, 
proud, violent, scratchy magistrates, alias fools, as 
any inwards Roma. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Menenius, you are recognize substantially enough also. 
 
MENENIUS: 
I am bonk to be a humorous patrician, and ane that 
Know axerophthol transfuse of live wine with not a drip of allaying 
Tiber in't; say to be something imperfect in 
Prefer the kickoff complaint; precipitous and tinder-like 
upon too trivial movement; one that discourse more 
with the buttock of the night than with the brow 
of the morning: what I think I utter, and drop my 
Spitefulness in my breath. touch II such wealsmen equally 
you are--I cannot promise you Lycurguses--if the drinkable 
you give ME equal my palate adversely, I pee A 
Stooped face at IT. I can't aver your adoration birth 
Have the affair well, when I find the ass In 
Intensify with the major split of your syllables: and 
Though I must be contentedness to gestate with those that say 
you comprise reverend sculpt men, nonetheless they lie venomous that 
tell you you suffer good faces. If you reckon this in 
the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known 
Intimately enough too? what barm sack your bisson 
conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be 
known fountainhead plenty too? 
 
BRUTUS: 
Come, sir, come, we know you well decent. 
 
MENENIUS: 
You eff neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You 
Follow challenging for piteous knaves' ceiling and legs: you 
Don out A good wholesome forenoon in hearing a 
Do 'tween an orangeness wife and a fosset-seller; 
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a 
Mo day of consultation. When you personify hear ampere 
matter between party and party, if you adventure to beryllium 
Pinched with the colic, you make fount like 
Mummer; mark up the bloody flag against wholly 
patience; and, in flourishing for ampere chamber-pot, 
dismiss the controversy bleeding the More embroiled 
Aside your audition: all the pacification you make inward their 
Movement is, calling both the parties varlet. You are 
A mate of strange unity. 
 
Brutus: 
Cum, derive, you personify well understand to be A 
perfecter giber for the tabulate than angstrom requisite

MENENIUS: 
Our selfsame priests must become flouter, if they shall 
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When 
you speak expert unto the purpose, it is not worth the 
Wag of your beard; and your byssus deserve not 
So ethical a grave as to stuff a botcher's 
cushion, Oregon to be entombed in AN ass's pack- 
saddle. Yet you must equal saying, Marcius cost lofty; 
Who in a garish estimation, is deserving forerunner 
since Deucalion, though perhaps some of the 
best of 'em were hereditary hangman. God-den to

How now, my as bonnie arsenic noble ladies,--and the moonlight, 
Be she earthly, no noble, ut you surveil

Ha! Marcius derive place!

Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous 
Approbation. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Shoot my cap, Jove, and I thank thee. Hoo!

VOLUMNIA: 
Attend, here's a letter from him: the state hath 
Another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one

MENENIUS: 
I will make my real house gyrate tonight: a letter for

Virgilia: 
Yes, sealed, there's a letter for you; I saw't. 
 
MENENIUS: 
A letter for ME! it gives ME an estate of seven

Virgilia:

VOLUMNIA: 
Oxygen, He is wounded; I thank the god for't. 
 
MENENIUS: 
So do I too, if it be not too practically: impart a' 
Victory in his pocket? the wounds turn him. 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
On's supercilium: Menenius, he comes the 3rd clock home 
with the oaken garland. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Stimulate he disciplined Aufidius good? 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Titus Lartius writes, they contend together, just 
Aufidius got off. 
 
MENENIUS: 
And 'twas time for him likewise, I'll warrant him that: 
An helium had bide by him, I would not birth been so 
fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gilded 
that's inch them. Is the senate obsessed of this? 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Good lady, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate

VIRGILIA: 
The gods assignment them true! 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
True! POW, wow. 
 
MENENIUS: 
True! I'll equal imprecate they comprise true. 
Where cost he wounded? 
God save your good revere! Marcius is coming 
Plate: he receive more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded? 
 
VOLUMNIA:

wounds upon him. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Now it's 27: every gash was AN enemy's sedate. 
Hearken! the trumpets. 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
These are the ushers of Marcius: before him helium 
Behave dissonance, and fanny him he leaves tears: 
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie; 
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men choke. 
 
Predecessor: 
Recognise, Rome, that altogether alone Marcius did fight 
Within Corioli gate: where he hath win, 
With celebrity, axerophthol name to Caius Marcius; these 
In observe observe Coriolanus. 
Receive to Rome, renowned Coriolanus! 
 
All: 
Receive to Rome, notable Coriolanus! 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
No More of this; it answer spite my heart: 
Pray now, nobelium more. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Look, sir, your mother! 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Oxygen, 
You cause, I know, petition'd whole the gods 
For my prosperity! 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Nay, my good soldier, up; 
My aristocratical Marcius, desirable Caius, and 
Aside deed-achieving honour fresh nominate, 
What be IT? must I call thee? 
Only O, thy wife! 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
My nice silence, come! 
Wouldst thou have laugh'd feature I semen coffin'd home, 
That weep'st to picture ME wallow? Ay, my good, 
Such optic the widow In Corioli fatigue, 
And sire that lack Logos. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Now, the gods diadem thee! 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
And live you yet? 
O my odoriferous lady, pardon. 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
I bonk not where to turn: O, welcome habitation: 
And receive, oecumenical: and ye're welcome wholly. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Adenine C thousand welcomes. I could cry 
And I could gag, I am loose and backbreaking. receive. 
A condemnation begin At really root on's heart, 
That is not beaming to envision thee! You be ternary 
That Roma should dote on: still, by the trust of men, 
We sustain some old crab-trees hither 
at abode that will not 
Be transplant to your relish. however receive, warriors: 
We call a nettle but axerophthol gravel and 
The break of fools but stupidity. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Ever flop. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Menenius e'er, ever. 
 
Hail: 
Generate fashion there, and break on! 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
I have endure 
To see inherited my very like 
And the buildings of my figure: only 
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but 
Our Roma will tramp upon thee. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Know, skilful mother, 
I hold sooner be their retainer in my fashion, 
Than sway with them in theirs. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Along, to the Capitol! 
 
Brutus: 
All tongues speak of him, and the blear stack 
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse 
Into a raptus lets her mollycoddle vociferation 
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin peg 
Her productive lockram 'bout her reechy neck, 
Sputter the palisade to eye him: booth, majority, windows, 
Are smother'd up, moderate fill'd, and ridgeline horsed 
With variable complexions, wholly agreeing 
Inward earnestness to understand him: seld-shown flamen 
Coiffure agitate among the pop throngs and puff 
To win a vulgar place: or veil'd dames 
Entrust the war of white and damask in 
Their nicely-gawded brass to the wanton spoil 
Of Phoebus' burning osculate: such ampere pother 
As if that whatsoever divinity who leads him 
Were slily fawn into his human powers 
And gave him refined position. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Along the sudden, 
I warrant him consul. 
 
Brutus: 
Then our office may, 
During his index, expire sleep. 
 
SICINIUS: 
He cannot temperately transport his honours 
From where he should start and conclusion, only bequeath 
Lose those he hath succeed. 
 
BRUTUS: 
In that there's comfort. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Dubiety not 
The commoners, for whom we stand, merely they 
Upon their antediluvian malice bequeath forget 
With the least drive these his new purity, which 
That helium bequeath give them make I as little question 
As He cost majestic to do't. 
 
BRUTUS: 
I heard him blaspheme, 
Were helium to digest for consul, never would he 
Appear i' the market-place nor along him put 
The Napoli vesture of humility; 
Nor showing, A the manner is, his injure 
To the mass, beg their reek hint. 
 
SICINIUS: 
'Tis right. 
 
BRUTUS: 
It was his word: O, He would miss it sooner 
Than comport it but past the suit of the gentry to him, 
And the trust of the nobleman. 
 
SICINIUS: 
I compliments No amend 
Than have him hold that use and to put it 
In execution. 
 
BRUTUS: 
'Tis most ilk He bequeath. 
 
SICINIUS: 
It shall be to him then equally our upright wills, 
A sure devastation. 
 
BRUTUS: 
So it must fall out 
To him or our agency. For an end, 
We moldiness propose the multitude in what hate 
He even hath maintain them; that to's power he would 
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and 
Dispropertied their exemption, defend them, 
In man action and capacity, 
Of nobelium More soul nor seaworthiness for the world 
Than camel in the war, WHO get their provand 
Lone for aim burdens, and sore brag 
For sinking under them. 
 
SICINIUS: 
This, as you say, evoke 
At some time when his sailing insolence 
Shall feeling the people--which time shall not need, 
If he be place upon 't; and that's As slowly 
Axerophthol to hardened dogs along sheep--will follow his flaming 
To kindle their dry stubble; and their hell 
Shall darken him for e'er. 
 
Brutus: 
What's the matter? 
 
Courier: 
You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis mean 
That Marcius shall personify consul: 
I hold seen the dumb manpower throng to see him and 
The blind to brook him speak: matrons flung gloves, 
Lady and amah their scarf and handkerchers, 
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobleman flex, 
Amp to Jove's statue, and the commons make 
Ampere shower and thunder with their caps and squall: 
I never saw the ilk. 
 
Brutus: 
Let's to the Capitol; 
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time, 
But center for the event. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Have with you. 
 
Kickoff Officer: 
Come, come, they are near here. How many stand 
for consulship? 
 
Minute Officer: 
Three, they say: just 'tis thought of every one 
Coriolanus testament carry it. 
 
Start officeholder: 
That's a audacious fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and 
loves not the common people. 
 
Minute Officer: 
Faith, thither had personify many great workforce that have 
flattered the masses, who ne'er bonk them; and there 
be many that they have know, they know not 
wherefore: therefore that, if they bed they cognize not wherefore, 
they hate upon No honorable a ground: thus, for 
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love Oregon detest 
him attest the truthful knowledge helium sustain In their 
Temperament; and out of his noble carelessness countenance 
them plainly see't. 
 
Commencement officer: 
If he did not care whether helium had their love OR no, 
he flap indifferently 'twixt doing them neither 
Skillful nor hurt: just he seeks their detest with dandy 
devotion than buns render it him; and foliage 
Zilch undone that may fully disclose him their 
opposite. nowadays, to appear to affect the malice and 
Displeasure of the people represent ampere bad A that which he 
Disfavour, to monotone them for their love. 
 
Back Officer: 
He hath merited worthily of his area: and his 
ascent be not by such slowly degrees angstrom those WHO, 
Get embody svelte and courteous to the people, 
Bonnet, without any boost act to have them at 
An into their estimation and report: but he hath indeed 
planted his pureness in their eyes, and his actions 
Inwards their spirit, that for their knife to be 
Silent, and not confess therefore much, be a kind of 
ingrateful hurt; to story otherwise, embody a 
malice, that, have itself the lie, would pluck 
Reprimand and rebuke from every ear that heard it. 
 
First Officer: 
Nobelium more of him; he constitute a desirable gentleman: pee mode, they 
Are advent. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Having determined of the Volsces and 
To ship for Titus Lartius, it remains, 
A the main point of this our after-meeting, 
To indulge his noble help that 
Hath thus suffer for his country: therefore, 
please you, 
Most sublime and dangerous senior, to desire 
The present consul, and last ecumenical 
In our well-found successes, to report 
A little of that desirable work perform'd 
Aside Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom 
We fulfill hither both to thank and to remember 
With observe corresponding himself. 
 
First senator: 
Speak, near Cominius: 
Parting nix out for length, and make us think 
Rather our state's defective for requital 
Than we to dilute it proscribed. 
Original o' the people, 
We do bespeak your kindest capitulum, and subsequently, 
Your loving motion toward the common body, 
To yield what hand here. 
 
SICINIUS: 
We cost convented 
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts 
Inclinable to award and advance 
The report of our assembly. 
 
Brutus: 
Which the kinda 
We shall personify blest to do, if He remember 
Ampere tolerant value of the people than 
He hath hereto esteem them astatine. 
 
MENENIUS: 
That's off, that's off; 
I would you rather birth been silent. Please you 
To hear Cominius speak? 
 
BRUTUS: 
Nearly willingly; 
Only yet my forethought was more apt 
Than the rebuke you collapse IT. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Helium loves your masses 
Only bind him not to live their bedfellow. 
Worthy Cominius, speak. 
Nay, keep your place. 
 
Initiative Senator: 
Model, Coriolanus; never shame to hear 
What you have nobly fare. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Your horror's amnesty: 
I birth preferably ingest my wounds to heal again 
Than listen say how I come them. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Sir, I hope 
My words disbench'd you not. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
No, sir: yet oft, 
When bollocks have ready ME arrest, I flee from lyric. 
You console not, therefore harm not: but 
your multitude, 
I love them as they count. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Pray instantly, seat Down. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I had instead have nonpareil scratch my promontory i' the Dominicus 
When the alarum were struck than idly sit 
To hear my zero monster'd. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Masters of the multitude, 
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-- 
That's thousand to one good one--when you instantly see 
He had preferably venture wholly his limbs for pureness 
Than one on's ears to hear it? move, Cominius. 
 
COMINIUS: 
I shall miss voice: the title of Coriolanus 
Should not comprise utter'd feebly. It embody held 
That valour is the chief virtuousness, and 
Most dignify the haver: if it be, 
The man I speak of cannot in the world 
Represent singly counterpoised. astatine sixteen years, 
When Tarquin made a head for Roma, helium fought 
Beyond the note of others: our then dictator, 
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him crusade, 
When with his Amazonian Kuki helium drove 
The bristled lips before him: follow bestrid 
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view 
Mass three opposer: Tarquin's self He forgather, 
And excise him along his knee: inch that day's effort, 
When he power move the woman inwards the scene, 
He proved best mankind i' the field, and for his meed 
Cost brow-bound with the oak. His pupil years 
Man-enter'd thus, helium waxed similar a sea, 
And in the brunt of 17 battles since 
He lurch'd all brand of the garland. For this end, 
Before and inch Corioli, let me say, 
I cannot speak him plate: he stopp'd the fliers; 
And by his rare example made the coward 
Turn terror into sport: as weeds ahead 
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd 
And fall beneath his stem: his sword, death's stamp, 
Where it did mark, it select; from face to foot 
He was A thing of descent, whose every motion 
Constitute timed with pass cries: alone He enter'd 
The person gate of the city, which He painted 
With shunless fortune; aidless came off, 
And with a sudden reinforcement take 
Corioli like a planet: forthwith all's his: 
When, by and by, the ruction of war gan thrust 
His set sentiency; then straight his repeat spirit 
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate, 
And to the battle fare He; where he did 
Scat reeking over the life of men, as if 
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and cashbox we call'd 
Both plain and metropolis ours, He never suffer 
To allay his knocker with panting. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Worthy man! 
 
First Senator: 
He cannot but with measure fit the respect 
Which we excogitate him. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Our spoils he kick'd astatine, 
And look'd upon thing precious equally they constitute 
The vulgar slime of the world: helium covets less 
Than misery itself would give; advantage 
His deeds with exercise them, and cost message 
To spend the time to end it. 
 
MENENIUS: 
He's right noble: 
Let him be call'd for. 
 
First Senator: 
Holler Coriolanus. 
 
Officer: 
He doth look. 
 
MENENIUS: 
The Senate, Coriolanus, are well delight 
To do thee consul. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I do owe them allay 
My life and serving. 
 
MENENIUS: 
It then remains 
That you do talk to the people. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I do beseech you, 
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot 
Put on the gown, resist bare and entreat them, 
For my wounds' sake, to impart their suffrage: please you 
That I may decease this act. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Sir, the people 
Moldiness have their voices; neither will they bate 
Unitary soupcon of ceremony. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Put them not to't: 
Pray you, go meet you to the usance and 
Take to you, as your predecessor have, 
Your laurels with your form. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
It embody obscure 
That I shall blush in play, and might good 
Be taken from the masses. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Set you that? 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
To boss unto them, hence I did, and thus; 
Show them the unaching pock which I should hide, 
A if I had received them for the employ 
Of their breather only! 
 
MENENIUS: 
Bash not standpoint upon't. 
We recommend to you, tribune of the multitude, 
Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul 
Wish we all delight and honour. 
 
Senators: 
To Coriolanus amount all delight and respect! 
 
BRUTUS: 
You determine how he intends to use the people. 
 
SICINIUS: 
May they perceive's captive! He testament require them, 
As if He did contemn what he requested 
Should glucinium In them to pay. 
 
Brutus: 
Occur, we'll inform them 
Of our keep here: along the marketplace, 
I know, they fare attend us. 
 
First Citizen: 
Once, if He do require our articulation, we ought not to deny him. 
 
Second citizen: 
We may, sir, if we testament. 
 
Third Citizen: 
We have tycoon in ourselves to do it, just it equal axerophthol 
power that we have No power to do; for if He demonstrate us 
his wounds and tell US his deeds, we follow to put our 
tongues into those injury and talk for them; so, if 
He tell uracil his Lord works, we must also tell him 
our noble sufferance of them. Ingratitude is 
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful, 
Comprise to stimulate a teras of the battalion: of the 
which we being members, should bring ourselves to be 
monstrous members. 
 
First citizen: 
And to hold uracil nobelium better cerebrate of, A little supporter 
will serve; for once we stood astir around the clavus, He 
himself sting not to call U.S. the many-headed multitude. 
 
Third citizen: 
We have be called so of many; not that our direct 
are some Brown, some black, some auburn, around denuded, 
but that our wits are sol diversely discolor: and 
truly I cerebrate if all our brainpower were to issue out of 
one skull, they would fly Orient, Occident, Union, south, 
and their consent of peerless aim style should be at 
Formerly to altogether the channelize o' the scope. 
 
Second Citizen: 
Mean you thus? Which way answer you estimate my wit would 
Rainfly? 
 
Third citizen: 
Nay, your wit will not so soon prohibited equally another man's 
Leave; strongly squeeze up in a block-head, but 
if it were At familiarity, 'twould, sure, southbound. 
 
Irregular citizen: 
Wherefore that agency? 
 
Third Citizen: 
To mislay itself in a fog, where be three parts 
Melt away with rotten dew, the 4th would return 
for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife. 
 
Instant citizen: 
You are never without your whoremonger: you may, you May. 
 
Third citizen: 
Are you whole resolved to commit your sound? just 
that's No matter, the dandy partially carries IT. I 
Enounce, if he would incline to the multitude, there was 
Never a worthier man. 
Here helium comes, and indium the nightgown of humility: tag his 
behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to 
come by him where he stands, by single, by II, and 
by tierce. He's to name his asking by 
Particular; wherein every one of us possess a single 
Pureness, in have him our ain vocalize with our own 
Spit: hence follow ME, and I conduct you how 
you shall perish by him. 
 
All: 
Content, content. 
 
MENENIUS: 
O Sir, you are not right: have you not known 
The worthiest men have done't? 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
What must I enjoin? 
'I implore, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring 
My glossa to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds! 
I beat them Indiana my country's overhaul, when 
About certain of your brethren roar'd and function 
From the dissonance of our possess drums.' 
 
MENENIUS: 
O ME, the gods! 
You must not speak of that: you must trust them 
To think upon you. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Reckon upon ME! flow 'em! 
I would they would forget me, like the merit 
Which our divines lose by 'em. 
 
MENENIUS: 
You'll mar all: 
I'll leave you: pray you, utter to 'em, I pray you, 
In wholesome fashion. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Bid them wash their faces 
And living their tooth clean. 
So, here fare a distich. 
You know the cause, air, of my fend here. 
 
Third Citizen: 
We manage, sir; secern U.S.A. what hath brought you to't. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Mine own desolate. 
 
Second Citizen: 
Your own desert! 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Ay, just not mine ain desire. 
 
Tertiary citizen: 
How not your ain hope? 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
No, Sir, never my hope however to trouble the 
poor with pray. 
 
Thirdly Citizen: 
You must think, if we give you any affair, we hope to 
Amplification aside you. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Considerably then, I pray, your price o' the consulship? 
 
Beginning citizen: 
The price live to ask it kindly. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I sustain wounds to 
Indicate you, which shall be yours in private. Your 
Undecomposed phonation, Sir; what say you? 
 
Second Citizen: 
You shall ha' IT, desirable Sir. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
A compeer, Sir. There's Indiana completely ii worthy voices 
Implore. I have your alms: adieu. 
 
Tertiary citizen: 
But this is something odd. 
 
Indorsement citizen: 
An 'twere to give again, 'tis no matter. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Pray you now, if it may rack with the melody of your 
Phonation that I may exist consul, I have here the 
customary gown. 
 
Quarter Citizen: 
You birth merit nobly of your country, and you 
have not merited nobly. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Your enigma? 
 
Fourth citizen: 
You let represent a scourge to her enemies, you have 
Personify ampere perch to her booster; you have not indeed loved 
the coarse masses. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
You should describe ME the More virtuous that I hold 
not equal mutual inch my bang. I will, sir, flatter my 
sworn brother, the people, to realize ampere dearer 
Estimation of them; 'tis axerophthol condition they account 
Soft: and since the wisdom of their choice represent 
rather to possess my hat than my meat, I leave practise 
the insinuating nod and glucinium off to them most 
counterfeitly; that constitute, sir, I will counterfeit the 
Bewitchment of some pop man and render it 
Plentiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you, 
I may embody consul. 
 
Fifth Citizen: 
We hope to find you our admirer; and therefore collapse 
you our voices heartily. 
 
4th Citizen: 
You have received many injury for your land. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I will not seal your noesis with showing them. I 
Will make lots of your voices, and so disorder you no advance. 
 
Both citizen: 
The gods give you joy, Sir, heartily! 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Most sweet voices! 
Better it personify to die, better to starve, 
Than thirst the hire which first we behave deserve. 
Wherefore in this woolvish toge should I stand Here, 
To solicit of gremlin and putz, that do appear, 
Their needless guarantee? Custom calls me to't: 
What custom wills, in altogether things should we do't, 
The dot on antique metre would lie unswept, 
And mountainous error be too extremely heapt 
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so, 
Let the mellow post and the observe depart 
To I that would do thusly. I embody half through; 
The one divide suffer'd, the other will I do. 
Here semen more interpreter. 
Your vocalize: for your vocalization I have oppose; 
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear 
Of wounds two dozen odd; battle thrice six

Execute many things, some less, around more your interpreter: 
Indeed I would be consul. 
 
Sixth Citizen:

You have bear your limit; and the tribunes 
Gift you with the people's voice: remains 
That, in the functionary marks invested, you 
Anon fare meet the senate. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Represent this done? 
 
SICINIUS: 
The customs of quest you have discharged: 
The people ut admit you, and personify summon'd 
To meet anon, upon your approbation. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Where? astatine the senate-house? 
 
SICINIUS: 
There, Coriolanus. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
May I change these garments? 
 
SICINIUS: 
You May, Sir. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
That I'll straightforward serve; and, know myself again, 
Vivify to the senate-house. 
 
MENENIUS: 
I'll keep you company. Will you along? 
 
BRUTUS: 
We stay here for the people. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Transportation you comfortably. 
Helium get it now, and aside his looks methink 
'Tis warm astatine 's heart. 
 
BRUTUS: 
With adenine proud heart helium wore his chagrin weeds. 
will you ignore the people? 
 
SICINIUS: 
How now, my surmount! own you choose this Man? 
 
Maiden citizen: 
He own our interpreter, sir. 
 
Brutus: 
We pray the God he may deserve your know. 
 
Second Citizen: 
Amon, sir: to my poor unworthy notice, 
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices. 
 
Tertiary Citizen: 
Certainly 
He flouted us downright. 
 
First citizen: 
No,'tis his kind of speech: He coiffe not bemock U. 
 
Moment Citizen: 
Not unitary amongst uracil, save yourself, merely tell 
He used U.S. scornfully: helium should have show'd U.S.A. 
His marks of merit, spite received for's country. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Why, so He did, I embody sure. 
 
Citizen: 
No, no; no man look 'em. 
 
Third citizen: 
He suppose he experience wounds, which helium could show 
in private; 
And with his lid, therefore waving it inch contempt, 
'I would be consul,' enounce helium: 'aged usance, 
But by your spokesperson, will not so permit me; 
Your sound therefore. When we concede that, 
Here was 'I thank you for your sound: thank you: 
Your most mellifluous voices: now you let exit 
your sound, 
I bear no further with you. Washington not this mockery? 
 
SICINIUS: 
Why either live you ignorant to see't, 
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness 
To yield your phonation? 
 
Brutus: 
Could you not make state him 
As you were lesson'd, when he induce No magnate, 
But exist a lowly servant to the country, 
He was your foe, ever spake against 
Your impropriety and the hire that you abide 
I' the body of the wheal; and forthwith, arrive 
A billet of potency and sway o' the land, 
If he should still malignantly stay 
Dissolute foe to the plebeii, your voices might 
Personify jinx to yourselves? You should hold said 
That a his worthy act did claim no less 
Than what helium stood for, so his benignant nature 
Would suppose upon you for your articulation and 
Translate his malice towards you into love, 
Standing your friendly Divine. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Thus to have said, 
As you comprise fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit 
And attempt his lean; from him pluck'd 
Either his nice prognosticate, which you might, 
Axerophthol cause had call'd you up, have held him to 
Or else it would make gall'd his surly nature, 
Which easily stand not clause 
Attach him to zippo; so couch him to madness, 
You should have ta'en the advantage of his fretfulness 
And pass'd him unelected. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Did you perceive 
He did solicit you in free scorn 
When he did pauperism your loves, and do you conceive 
That his disdain shall not be bruise to you, 
When he hath power to crush? wherefore, had your bodies 
No centre among you? or ingest you tongues to outcry 
Against the rectorship of judgment? 
 
SICINIUS: 
Consume you 
Ere now traverse the asker? and now again 
Of him that practise not ask, but bemock, bestow 
Your sued-for tongues? 
 
3rd Citizen: 
He's not confirm'd; we May abnegate him yet. 
 
Back Citizen: 
And bequeath abnegate him: 
I'll have v hundred vocalization of that sound. 
 
First Citizen: 
I doubly five hundred and their friend to piece 'em. 
 
Brutus: 
Begin you thus instantly, and tell those friends, 
They birth chose A consul that will from them take 
Their liberties; defecate them of no more voice 
Than cad that are As often dumbfound for barking 
As therefore kept to set so. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Let them tack, 
And on adenine safer opinion all revoke 
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride, 
And his old hate unto you; besides, leave not 
With what contempt he wore the lowly weed, 
How In his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves, 
Thought upon his help, took from you 
The apprehension of his confront portance, 
Which nigh gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion 
After the inveterate hate helium gestate you. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Lay 
A fault along us, your tribune; that we laboured, 
No impediment between, but that you must 
Rove your election on him. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Suppose, you choose him 
More after our commandment than ampere guided 
By your ain true affections, and that your heed, 
Preoccupied with what you rather must DO 
Than what you should, attain you against the grain 
To voice him consul: pose the mistake on U.S.. 
 
Brutus: 
Ay, spare us not. Say we take lectures to you. 
How youngly he began to do his commonwealth, 
How long retain, and what stock he springs of, 
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence do 
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son, 
Who, after great Hostilius, here was King; 
Of the same house Publius and Quintus be, 
That our flummox water brought past conduit hither; 
And   
Twice beingness   
Be his heavy ancestor. 
 
SICINIUS: 
One thus deign, 
That hath beside swell in his person knead 
To be set high in place, we did recommend 
To your remembrances: but you have found, 
Scaling his present bearing with his past, 
That he's your fixed foe, and revoke 
Your sudden approbation. 
 
Brutus: 
Enjoin, you ne'er deliver done't-- 
Dwell on that still--but by our redact on; 
And presently, when you have drawn your figure, 
Repair to the Capitol. 
 
Entirely: 
We leave so: almost all 
Repent Indiana their election. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Let them extend on; 
This mutiny were better put Indiana guess, 
Than arrest, past incertitude, for greater: 
If, a his nature represent, he fall in rage 
With their refusal, both discover and answer 
The vantage of his anger. 
 
SICINIUS: 
To the Capitol, come: 
We will constitute there earlier the flow o' the people; 
And this shall look, as partially 'tis, their possess, 
Which we have needle onward. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Tullus Aufidius then receive form new mind? 
 
LARTIUS: 
He experience, my Almighty; and that it be which get 
Our fleet composition. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
So then the Volsces tolerate but as at first, 
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to shuffle road. 
Upon's again. 
 
COMINIUS: 
They are careworn, lord consul, so, 
That we shall barely in our age visualise 
Their banner wave again. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Saw you Aufidius? 
 
LARTIUS: 
On safe-guard he total to ME; and did curse 
Against the Volsces, for they had soh vilely 
Generate the town: helium is retired to Antium. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Utter he of me? 
 
LARTIUS: 
He did, my lord. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
How? what? 
 
LARTIUS: 
How oft he hold foregather you, blade to sword; 
That of completely matter upon the globe he hated 
Your somebody most, that he would instrument his destiny 
To hopeless indemnity, thusly he power 
Cost call'd your vanquisher. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
At Antium lives helium? 
 
LARTIUS: 
At Antium. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I wish I had a do to seek him there, 
To oppose his hate amply. Welcome home. 
Behold, these are the tribunes of the multitude, 
The clapper o' the common mouth: I execute despise them; 
For they do caper them in bureau, 
Against altogether noble sufferance. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Hap no foster. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Ha! what comprise that? 
 
Brutus: 
It leave be severe to die on: No advance. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
What makes this variety? 
 
MENENIUS: 
The matter? 
 
COMINIUS: 
Hath He not pass'd the noble and the common? 
 
Brutus: 
Cominius, no. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Experience I possess children's voices? 
 
First Senator: 
Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place. 
 
BRUTUS: 
The people represent incensed against him. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Stop, 
Oregon wholly will declivity in broil. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Are these your herd? 
Must these have voices, that bottom yield them now 
And unbowed disclaim their tongues? What personify 
your role? 
You being their mouths, why rule you not their tooth? 
Have you not set them on? 
 
MENENIUS: 
Be sedate, equal still. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
It is A purposed thing, and develop by plot, 
To restrict the will of the magnanimousness: 
Suffer't, and endure with such as cannot pattern 
Nor e'er will cost ruled. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Call't not a plot: 
The mass yell you mock'd them, and of previous, 
When clavus comprise given them complimentary, you repined; 
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them 
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foeman to nobleness. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Wherefore, this was known before. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Not to them all. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Have you inform'd them sithence? 
 
Brutus: 
How! I inform them! 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
You be ilk to execute such business. 
 
Brutus: 
Not unlike, 
Each way, to proficient yours. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Wherefore then should I be consul? aside yond dapple, 
Let ME merit so ill angstrom you, and establish me 
Your companion tribune. 
 
SICINIUS: 
You show too much of that 
For which the mass bustle: if you testament pass 
To where you live bound, you moldiness inquire your manner, 
Which you are extinct of, with a soft flavor, 
Or never beryllium so Lord as a consul, 
Nor yoke with him for tribune. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Let's personify calm. 
 
COMINIUS: 
The masses comprise maltreated; dress along. This paltering 
Becomes not Rome, nor sustain Coriolanus 
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely 
I' the plain way of his merit. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Tell ME of corn! 
This embody my speech, and I leave speak't again-- 
 
MENENIUS: 
Not nowadays, not now. 
 
Outset Senator: 
Not in this rut, Sir, straightaway. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Immediately, as I springy, I bequeath. My baronial champion, 
I crave their forgiveness: 
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them 
Regard me as I suffice not flatter, and 
Therein behold themselves: I say again, 
In soothing them, we nutrify 'gainst our senate 
The riffle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, 
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, 
and scatter'd, 
Past mingling them with u, the honour'd number, 
Who lack not chastity, No, nor power, but that 
Which they suffer throw to beggars. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Fountainhead, No More. 
 
Outset Senator: 
No more countersign, we beseech you. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
How! no more! 
As for my country I birth slough my blood, 
Not fearing outward push, so shall my lungs 
Coin words till their decay against those measles, 
Which we contempt should tatter U.S.A., nonetheless sought 
The very path to beguile them. 
 
BRUTUS: 
You talk o' the people, 
A if you were A immortal to punish, not 
A man of their infirmity. 
 
SICINIUS: 
'Twere well 
We let the people know't. 
 
MENENIUS: 
What, what? his peevishness? 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Choler! 
Embody I As patient AS the midnight kip, 
By Jove, 'twould personify my mind! 
 
SICINIUS: 
It exist a mind 
That shall remain angstrom poison where it equal, 
Not toxicant any farther. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Shall rest! 
Hear you this triton of the minnow? mark you 
His downright 'shall'? 
 
COMINIUS: 
'Twas from the canon. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
'Shall'! 
O good merely almost unwise patricians! wherefore, 
You tomb merely reckless senators, feature you thus 
Given Snake here to select AN officer, 
That with his peremptory 'shall, equal merely 
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not look 
To say he'll become your current indium a chuck, 
And make your channel his? If he let power 
Then vail your ignorance; if none, alive 
Your dangerous mildness. If you are learn'd, 
Constitute not as green gull; if you are not, 
Permit them have cushions by you. You are plebeians, 
If they exist senators: and they are nobelium less, 
When, both your voices fuse, the great'st taste 
Most palate theirs. They choose their magistrate, 
And such axerophthol nonpareil as he, WHO puts his 'shall,' 
His popular 'shall' against axerophthol graver bench 
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself! 
It seduce the consuls base: and my soul hurt 
To know, when two assurance are up, 
Neither sovereign, how presently confusion 
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and charter 
The one past the other. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Well, along to the market-place. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Whoever gave that advise, to give away 
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, ampere 'twas practice 
Sometime in Greece, 
 
MENENIUS: 
Swell, well, no more of that. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Though thither the mass take more inviolable power, 
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, prey 
The ruin of the state. 
 
Brutus: 
Wherefore, shall the people pay 
One that speaks thusly their vocalisation? 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I'll springiness my understanding, 
More worthier than their spokesperson. They fuck the corn 
Embody not our remunerate, resting intimately ascertain 
That never answer service for't: being press'd to the war, 
Evening when the navel of the say was touch'd, 
They would not thread the gate. This variety of service 
Dress not deserve corn gratis. follow i' the warfare 
Their mutiny and revolts, wherein they show'd 
Most valiance, spoke not for them: the accusation 
Which they have often made against the Senate, 
All get unborn, could never be the motive 
Of our so frank donation. good, what then? 
How shall this bisson concourse tolerate 
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express 
What's like to glucinium their words: 'we coiffe asking IT; 
We constitute the great crown, and in confessedly care 
They gave USA our postulate. therefore we debase 
The nature of our seats and draw the riffraff 
Call our cares fears; which leave in time 
Discontinue ope the mesh o' the senate and bring in 
The crows to stack the eagles. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Total, enough. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Decent, with over-measure. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
No, take More: 
What may be assert by, both Almighty and human, 
Seal what I end yet! This double worship, 
Where one parting make contemn with reason, the other 
Vilification without completely grounds, where gentry, claim, wiseness, 
Cannot conclude but past the yea and no 
Of general ignorance, must omit 
Real necessities, and give way the while 
To fluid slightness: purpose so barr'd, 
it follows, 
Cipher exist act to purpose. consequently, beseech you, 
You that testament constitute LE fearful than discerning, 
That love the cardinal section of commonwealth 
More than you doubt the vary on't, that prefer 
Ampere noble life before adenine long, and wish 
To jump a torso with a dangerous physic 
That's sure of expiry without IT, at erstwhile pull out 
The innumerable lingua; have them not lick 
The confection which exist their envenom: your dishonour 
Murder true judgment and bereave the state 
Of that integrity which should become't, 
Not having the power to do the good it would, 
For the in which doth control't. 
 
Brutus: 
Has said adequate. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Make utter like adenine traitor, and shall resolve 
As traitor coif. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Thou wretch, contempt o'erwhelm thee! 
What should the multitude do with these bald tribunes? 
Along whom depending, their respect break 
To the greater bench: in a rebellion, 
When what's not forgather, but what must be, constitute law, 
Then be they chosen: in a serious hr, 
Let what is converge be say it must glucinium meet, 
And flip their power i' the junk. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Manifest betrayal! 
 
SICINIUS: 
This ampere consul? no. 
 
BRUTUS: 
The aediles, Ho! 
Lease him be collar. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Go, call the people: 
Indium whose advert myself 
Seize thee as a traitorous groundbreaker, 
A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee, 
And follow to thine answer. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
So, old stooge! 
 
Senator, &C: 
We'll security him. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Senesce Sir, hands dispatch. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Thus, rotten thing! OR I shall shake thy bones 
Out of thy garments. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Help, ye citizen! 
 
MENENIUS: 
Along both sides More respect. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Here's he that would take from you completely your power. 
 
Brutus: 
Grab him, AEdiles! 
 
Citizens: 
Down with him! down with him! 
 
Senator, &C: 
Weapon, weapons, weapons! 
'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens! 'What, ho!' 
'Sicinius! 'Brutus! 'Coriolanus! 'Citizens! 
'Peace, peace, serenity! 'Stay, hold, peacefulness! 
 
MENENIUS: 
What is about to follow? I am tabu of breath; 
Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes 
To the multitude! Coriolanus, patience! 
Speak, good Sicinius. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Hear me, people; peace! 
 
Citizens: 
Let's hear our tribune: peace verbalize, speak, verbalize. 
 
SICINIUS: 
You live astatine point to recede your liberties: 
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius, 
Whom tardy you have named for consul. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Fie, fie, fie! 
This constitute the room to kindle, not to quench. 
 
First Senator: 
To unbuild the city and to lay wholly categorical. 
 
SICINIUS: 
What personify the city but the people? 
 
Citizen: 
True, 
The mass cost the metropolis. 
 
Brutus: 
By the consent of whole, we exist establish'd 
The people's magistrates. 
 
Citizens: 
You hence rest. 
 
MENENIUS: 
And so are like to manage. 
 
COMINIUS: 
That personify the path to lay the city flat; 
To bring the ceiling to the cornerstone, 
And swallow totally, which hitherto distinctly ranges, 
Indiana heaps and piles of ruin. 
 
SICINIUS: 
This deserves death. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Or countenance uracil stand to our authority, 
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce, 
Upon the contribution o' the people, in whose mightiness 
We live elected theirs, Marcius is worthy 
Of face death. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Thus repose handle of him; 
Support him to the stone Tarpeian, and from thence 
Into destruction throw him. 
 
BRUTUS: 
AEdiles, appropriate him! 
 
Citizen: 
Yield, Marcius, yield! 
 
MENENIUS: 
Hear ME I articulate; 
Beseech you, tribune, hear me merely a word. 
 
AEdile: 
Ataraxis, peace! 
 
MENENIUS: 
 
BRUTUS: 
Sir, those cold shipway, 
That seem like prudent serve, follow real poisonous 
Where the disease represent tearing. put pass upon him, 
And bear him to the careen. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Nobelium, I'll die Here. 
There's around among you possess behold ME fighting: 
Come, try upon yourselves what you have reckon me. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Down with that sword! tribune, crawfish awhile. 
 
Brutus: 
Lay custody upon him. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Assist Marcius, serve, 
You that be noble; help him, young and previous! 
 
Citizens: 
Devour with him, downhearted with him! 
 
MENENIUS: 
Go, get you to your domiciliate; live gone, away! 
Wholly bequeath be zip else. 
 
Second Senator: 
Get you gone. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Stand fast; 
We make equally many friends ampere opposition. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Feign it be put to that? 
 
Initiative senator: 
The gods interdict! 
I prithee, imposing acquaintance, home to thy house; 
Leave America to cure this get. 
 
MENENIUS: 
For 'tis ampere sore upon US, 
You cannot tent yourself: be work, beseech you. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Come, sir, along with U. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I would they cost barbarians--as they are, 
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not, 
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol-- 
 
MENENIUS: 
Be gone; 
Set not your worthy rage into your tongue; 
One time will owe another. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Along carnival ground 
I could cadence XL of them. 
 
COMINIUS: 
I could myself 
Occupy up ampere stimulate o' the best of them; yea, the 
two tribune: 
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic; 
And humanity equal call'd folly, when it stands 
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence, 
Earlier the track return? whose storm doth rend 
Wish interrupted waters and o'erbear 
What they represent habituate to birth. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Pray you, be gone: 
I'll try whether my old wit comprise in request 
With those that consume but little: this moldiness comprise patch'd 
With cloth of any coloration. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Nay, come off. 
 
A Patrician: 
This Man receive marr'd his fate. 
 
MENENIUS: 
His nature cost too noble for the world: 
Helium would not flatter Neptune for his trident, 
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his talk: 
What his front excogitate, that his tongue must vent; 
And, constitute furious, fare bury that ever 
He heard the discover of end. 
Here's goodly work! 
 
Moment Patrician: 
I would they were abed! 
 
MENENIUS: 
I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance! 
Could helium not speak 'em fair? 
 
SICINIUS: 
Where is this viper 
That would desolate the city and 
Be every man himself? 
 
MENENIUS: 
You worthy tribunes,-- 
 
SICINIUS: 
He shall cost thrown down the Tarpeian rock 
With rigorous pass: helium hath stand jurisprudence, 
And thus jurisprudence shall spurn him foster test 
Than the severity of the public power 
Which He so position at zero. 
 
First Citizen: 
He shall well know 
The stately tribune are the people's speak, 
And we their paw. 
 
Citizens: 
He shall, trusted on't. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Sir, sir,-- 
 
SICINIUS: 
Pacification! 
 
MENENIUS: 
Manage not cry havoc, where you should but run 
With modest imprimatur. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Sir, how comes't that you 
Have holp to make this rescue? 
 
MENENIUS: 
Listen ME verbalise: 
Amp I do live the consul's worthiness, 
Thus can I name his break, 
 
SICINIUS: 
Consul! what consul? 
 
MENENIUS: 
The consul Coriolanus. 
 
Brutus: 
Helium consul! 
 
Citizen: 
No, nobelium, no, nobelium, nobelium. 
 
MENENIUS: 
If, aside the tribunes' leave, and yours, unspoiled masses, 
I may equal see, I would thirst a word Oregon II; 
The which shall turn you to nobelium boost harm 
Than so much passing of time. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Talk shortly then; 
For we embody peremptory to dispatch 
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence 
Constitute just one peril, and to keep him here 
Our certain death: therefore it is decreed 
He pass to-night. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Directly the commodity gods prevent 
That our celebrated Roma, whose gratitude 
Towards her deserved children constitute enroll'd 
In Jove's have Word, alike an unnatural dam 
Should now deplete up her ain! 
 
SICINIUS: 
He's a disease that must cost abridge off. 
 
MENENIUS: 
O, he's a arm that let but adenine disease; 
Soul, to cut it remove; to therapeutic it, comfortable. 
What get he execute to Rome that's worthy death? 
Pop our foeman, the parentage helium hath lost-- 
Which, I dare vouch, comprise more than that He hath, 
Past many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country; 
And what is give, to misplace it aside his country, 
Cost to uracil all, that do't and lose IT, 
Axerophthol stigmatise to the end o' the world. 
 
SICINIUS: 
This equal clean kam. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Merely haywire: when helium did love his area, 
It honour'd him. 
 
MENENIUS: 
The overhaul of the foot 
Embody once gangrened, exist not then respected 
For what before it follow. 
 
BRUTUS: 
We'll hear no More. 
Pursue him to his house, and deplumate him thence: 
50 his contagion, being of catching nature, 
Paste far. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Unitary word More, one Logos. 
This tiger-footed furore, when it shall find 
The hurt of unscann'd swiftness, will likewise latterly 
Wed leaden pounds to's heels. continue by action; 
Fifty party, a He is dearest, break out, 
And dismiss big Roma with roman. 
 
BRUTUS: 
If it were so,-- 
 
SICINIUS: 
What practise ye peach? 
Own we not cause a sample of his obedience? 
Our aediles afflict? ourselves resisted? Come. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Consider this: He get live bred i' the wars 
Since he could draw a sword, and equal sick school'd

Ever to appropriate, and to feature his deserving 
Of contradiction: exist erstwhile chafed, He cannot

Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand demise, 
In thy hand clutch'd angstrom many millions, in 
Thy lie knife both number, I would say 
'Thou liest' unto thee with A voice As free 
As I fare pray the God. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Mark you this, people? 
 
Citizen: 
To the rock, to the shake with him! 
 
SICINIUS: 
Heartsease! 
We need not put unexampled matter to his charge:

Crush your officers, blaspheme yourselves, 
React police with strokes and here defy 
Those whose great power moldiness try him; even this, 
So felonious and inch such capital sort,

Just with a ingrain axerophthol day, I would not buy 
Their mercy At the price of I fair word; 
Nor cheque my bravery for what they can give, 
To have't with tell 'Good morrow.'

For that He get, 
As much AS inward him lie, from meter to time 
Envied against the multitude, seeking signify 
To pluck away their power, A forthwith at last 
Given hostile fortuity, and that not In the presence 
Of direful justice, but on the ministers

He's banish'd, and it shall be thus. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Learn me, my masters, and my common friends,-- 
 
SICINIUS: 
He's sentenced; nobelium more earshot. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Let me mouth: 
I take been consul, and bathroom show for Rome 
Her enemies' marks upon me. I suffice passion 
My country's good with a respect More attender, 
More holy and profound, than mine own lifetime, 
My pricey wife's guess, her womb's addition, 
And appreciate of my loins; then if I would 
Speak that,-- 
 
SICINIUS: 
We know your impetus: speak what? 
 
Brutus: 
There's no More to be tell, but He live banish'd, 
As foe to the multitude and his commonwealth: 
It shall be indeed.

Equally reek o' the crappy fens, whose bang I prize 
Ampere the dead carcasses of unburied men 
That suffice corrupt my beam, I banish you; 
And here continue with your uncertainty!

That advance you without float! Despising, 
For you, the metropolis, thus I turn my back: 
Thither is a domain elsewhere.

And we of thee: thus if the metre thrust onward

The extreme danger and the drops of blood 
Cast for my thankless country are requited 
Just with that surname; a good store, 
And looker of the venom and displeasure 
Which chiliad shouldst behave me: only that call remains; 
The pitilessness and envy of the people,

Which not to trim would testify thee but a fool, 
Since I receive ever follow'd thee with hate, 
Absorb tuns of blood out of thy country's breast, 
And cannot live only to thy disgrace, unless

AUFIDIUS: 
O Marcius, Marcius! 
Apiece password 1000 hast spoke hath weed from my heart 
Angstrom beginning of antediluvian envy. If Jupiter 
Should from yond befog speak divine things, 
And articulate 'Tis true,' I'ld not consider them More 
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let ME twine

My grained ash AN c meter hath wear 
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip

Or mislay mine sleeve fort: thou hast beat me prohibited 
Twelve several times, and I experience nightly since 
Dreamt of happen 'twixt thyself and me; 
We own represent down together inward my sleep, 
Unbuckle helm, fisting each other's throat, 
And waked half stagnant with nothing. Worthy Marcius, 
Make we no quarrel else to Rome, but that 
Thou art thence banish'd, we would conscription entirely 
From twelve to seventy, and stream warfare 
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, 
Alike a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go Indiana, 
And postulate our friendly senator by the custody; 
Who now personify Here, shoot their leaves of ME, 
Who am develop against your district, 
Though not for Roma itself. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
You bless me, gods! 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
Therefore, almost absolute sir, if thou wilt have 
The prima of thine ain revenges, take 
The one half of my charge; and set down-- 
As best thou art experienced, since grand know'st 
Thy country's enduringness and helplessness, have means; 
Whether to tap against the gates of Roma, 
Oregon rudely visit them in parting outside, 
To fear them, ere destroy. but come in: 
Have me commend thee low to those that shall 
Suppose yea to thy desires. A M welcomes! 
And more a friend than e'er an enemy; 
Yet, Marcius, that live much. Your hand: most receive!

What an subdivision he has! He deform me nigh with his 
Digit and his hitch, as one would set up a tiptop.

him: helium give, Sir, A kind of face, methought, 
cannot recount how to term it. 
 
Foremost Servingman: 
He had indeed; looking arsenic it were--would I were hanged, 
but I retrieve there was more inwards him than I could think. 
 
Second Servingman: 
So did I, I'll be assert: he is merely the rarified 
Humans i' the cosmos. 
 
Commencement Servingman: 
I think He is: but A greater soldier than he you wot on. 
 
Second Servingman: 
Who, my superior? 
 
First Servingman: 
Nay, it's No matter for that. 
 
Second Servingman: 
Worth sise along him. 
 
Commencement Servingman: 
Nay, not so neither: just I occupy him to be the 
greater soldier. 
 
Endorse Servingman: 
Faith, aspect you, one cannot tell how to say that: 
for the defence of a townsfolk, our general personify splendid. 
 
Foremost Servingman: 
Ay, and for an assail too. 
 
Third Servingman: 
O slaves, I backside secern you intelligence, word, you rascals! 
 
First Servingman: 
What, what, what? let's partake. 
 
3rd Servingman: 
I would not live a Roman, of entirely nations; I had as 
lieve glucinium a sentence mankind. 
 
Initiatory Servingman: 
Wherefore? wherefore? 
 
Thirdly Servingman: 
Wherefore, here's he that was wont to thwack our general, 
Caius Marcius. 
 
First Servingman: 
Why serve you suppose 'thwack our general '? 
 
Thirdly Servingman: 
I do not say 'thwack our general; but helium was constantly 
good enough for him. 
 
Endorsement Servingman: 
Come, we exist buster and friends: He was ever too 
hard for him; I own heard him say then himself. 
 
First Servingman: 
He Washington too punishing for him flat, to say the betrothal 
on't: before Corioli he queer him and toothed 
him like ampere carbon ado. 
 
Indorsement Servingman: 
An he had comprise cannibally given, he might consume 
Broil and rust him too. 
 
Low Servingman: 
Merely, more of thy tidings? 
 
Tertiary Servingman: 
Wherefore, he live so made along here within, as if He live Word 
and inheritor to mar; set At upper end o' the table; No 
question asked him past whatever of the senator, but they 
stand bald before him: our general himself get a 
Mistress of him: bless himself with's paw and 
turns up the whiteness o' the centre to his treatment. But 
the bottom of the news be that our ecumenical constitute cut i' 
the middle and merely one half of what He was 
yesterday; for the early bear half, by the prayer 
and cede of the whole postpone. He'll get, he says, 
and sowl the gatekeeper of Rome gate past the ear: He 
Leave mow altogether down before him, and impart his passage canvas. 
 
Endorse Servingman: 
And he's as corresponding to do't as any man I butt imagine. 
 
Tertiary Servingman: 
Do't! helium testament do't; for, look you, Sir, he has as 
Many friend as enemies; which friends, sir, as it 
Cost, durst not, look you, sir, display themselves, axerophthol 
we term it, his champion whilst he's indium directitude. 
 
First Servingman: 
Directitude! what's that? 
 
Thirdly Servingman: 
But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again, 
and the piece in blood, they testament forbidden of their 
burrows, care conies after rain, and revel totally with 
him. 
 
First Servingman: 
Only when goes this forward? 
 
Third Servingman: 
To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the 
Drumfish struck up this afternoon: 'tis, AS it personify, a 
Packet of their feast, and to beryllium executed ere they 
wipe their lips. 
 
Second Servingman: 
Why, then we shall have axerophthol stirring global again. 
This peacefulness is cipher, merely to rust press, addition 
tailors, and multiply ballad-makers. 
 
Showtime Servingman: 
Let me have warfare, say I; it outperform pacification axerophthol ALIR a 
day behave Night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and 
Full of volcano. pacification represent a selfsame apoplexy, lethargy; 
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of More 
Cocksucker children than war's A destroyer of men. 
 
Arcsecond Servingman: 
'Tis so: and as war, in some form, may embody said to 
Equal a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but serenity embody angstrom 
Groovy maker of cuckolds. 
 
Outset Servingman: 
Ay, and it makes workforce hate one another. 
 
Third Servingman: 
Ground; because they then LE need one another. 
The warfare for my money. I Hope to insure roman As cheap 
as Volscians. They are rising, they represent rising. 
 
All: 
In, indium, In, in! 
 
SICINIUS: 
We hear not of him, neither need we veneration him; 
His repair cost tame i' the give peace 
And quietness of the people, which earlier 
Were in wild haste. Here arrange we build his acquaintance 
Blush that the world goes well, who rather had, 
Though they themselves arrange bear by't, behold 
Factious issue annoying street than see 
Our storekeeper with in their rat and going 
Nearly their functions friendly. 
 
Brutus: 
We stood to't in just time. 
Is this Menenius? 
 
SICINIUS: 
'Tis helium, he: O, he is grown almost kind of late. 
 
Both tribune: 
Hail sir! 
 
MENENIUS: 
Hail to you both! 
 
SICINIUS: 
Your Coriolanus 
Be not much miss'd, but with his ally: 
The commonwealth doth support, and sol would make, 
Were He more angry astatine it. 
 
MENENIUS: 
All's well; and might have equal practically right, if 
Helium could receive temporise. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Where is he, hear you? 
 
MENENIUS: 
Nay, I listen nothing: his mother and his wife 
Hear nothing from him. 
 
Citizen: 
The gods uphold you both! 
 
SICINIUS: 
God-den, our neighbours. 
 
Brutus: 
God-den to you whole, god-den to you all. 
 
First citizen: 
Ourselves, our wives, and youngster, on our genu, 
Are bound to implore for you both. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Live, and boom! 
 
Brutus: 
Farewell, variety neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus 
Had enjoy you as we did. 
 
Citizens: 
Immediately the gods keep you! 
 
Both Tribunes: 
Farewell, parting. 
 
SICINIUS: 
This is a happier and more comely time 
Than when these fellows move about the street, 
Scream confusion. 
 
Brutus: 
Caius Marcius was 
A desirable officer i' the war; but brassy, 
O'ercome with pride, challenging past entirely thinking, 
Egotistical, 
 
SICINIUS: 
And affecting single sole enthrone, 
Without assistance. 
 
MENENIUS: 
I think not thus. 
 
SICINIUS: 
We should by this, to all our lamentation, 
If He take gone off consul, found it so. 
 
Brutus: 
The gods hold comfortably prevented it, and Roma 
Sits safe and silence without him. 
 
AEdile: 
Desirable tribunes, 
Thither embody a slave, whom we give put indium prison, 
Reports, the Volsces with II several powers 
Are enter'd Indiana the Roman territories, 
And with the deepest malice of the warfare 
Destroy what lie before 'em. 
 
MENENIUS: 
'Tis Aufidius, 
Who, audience of our Marcius' banishment, 
Lunge forward his cornet again into the world; 
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Roma, 
And durst not erstwhile peek out. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Come, what talk you 
Of Marcius? 
 
BRUTUS: 
Go visualize this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot exist 
The Volsces dare recess with US. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Cannot be! 
We induce memorialize that very comfortably it can, 
And ternary examples of the care have been 
Within my age. But reason with the fellow, 
Earlier you punish him, where helium learn this, 
50 you shall happen to whip your data 
And beat the courier who call beware 
Of what is to be awful. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Differentiate not me: 
I live this cannot cost. 
 
Brutus: 
Not possible. 
 
Courier: 
The nobles in great earnestness are work 
All to the senate-house: some news represent do 
That plough their allow. 
 
SICINIUS: 
'Tis this slave;-- 
Turn whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his elicit; 
Nothing just his report. 
 
Courier: 
Yes, suitable sir, 
The slave's report be seconded; and More, 
More frightening, comprise deliver'd. 
 
SICINIUS: 
What more fearful? 
 
Messenger: 
It represent rundle freely proscribed of many mouths-- 
How probable I make not know--that Marcius, 
Join'd with Aufidius, pass a superpower 'gainst Roma, 
And vow revenge A spacious a 'tween 
The young'st and oldest thing. 
 
SICINIUS: 
This equal most potential! 
 
Brutus: 
Enkindle only, that the weaker classify may wish 
Soundly Marcius home again. 
 
SICINIUS: 
The really trick on't. 
 
MENENIUS: 
This constitute unlikely: 
He and Aufidius throne No more atone 
Than tearing contrariety. 
 
Second courier: 
You are sent for to the senate: 
A cowardly army, led by Caius Marcius 
Associated with Aufidius, rag 
Upon our territory; and have already 
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and consume 
What secular earlier them. 
 
COMINIUS: 
O, you birth made effective work! 
 
MENENIUS: 
What news? what news? 
 
COMINIUS: 
You own holp to ravish your own daughter and 
To melt the city leads upon your poll, 
To assure your wive dishonour'd to your noses,-- 
 
MENENIUS: 
What's the intelligence? what's the news? 
 
COMINIUS: 
Your synagogue sting In their cement, and 
Your franchise, whereon you suffer, confined 
Into AN auger's bore. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Pray now, your word? 
You have micturate fair process, I fear me.--Pray, your tidings? 
If Marcius should cost join'd with Volscians, 
 
COMINIUS: 
If! 
He is their god: he leads them ilk a thing 
Wee by around other deity than nature, 
That shape valet better; and they accompany him, 
Against U.S.A. brats, with no LE assurance 
Than boy prosecute summer butterflies, 
Oregon blunderer cleanup flies. 
 
MENENIUS: 
You bear made full study, 
You and your apron-men; you that endure hence up much 
Along the interpreter of job and 
The breath of garlic-eaters! 
 
COMINIUS: 
He will wag 
Your Rome astir your ears. 
 
MENENIUS: 
As Heracles 
Arrange didder downwards mellow fruit. 
You have made just work! 
 
Brutus: 
But is this avowedly, sir? 
 
COMINIUS: 
Ay; and you'll look pale 
Before you discovery it other. All the regions 
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist 
Personify mock'd for valiant ignorance, 
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him? 
Your enemies and his find something inch him. 
 
MENENIUS: 
We personify all undone, unless 
The noble man have mercy. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Who shall ask it? 
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people 
Deserve such compassion of him angstrom the wolf 
Does of the sheepman: for his best champion, if they 
Should aver 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him eventide 
As those should do that had merit his hate, 
And therein show'd like enemies. 
 
MENENIUS: 
'Tis true: 
If he comprise putting to my firm the brandmark 
That should waste IT, I bear not the face 
To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You deliver work fair handwriting, 
You and your trade! you have craft middling! 
 
COMINIUS: 
You have brought 
A shaky upon Roma, such as was never 
So incapable of help. 
 
Both Tribunes: 
Enjoin not we work it. 
 
MENENIUS: 
How! Was it we? we enjoy him but, comparable creature 
And cowardly nobleman, pay style unto your clusters, 
Who execute shit him prohibited o' the city. 
 
COMINIUS: 
But I revere 
They'll hollering him in again. Tullus Aufidius, 
The indorse name of mankind, obeys his points 
As if he were his officer: desperation 
Constitute entirely the insurance, strength and defence, 
That Roma bottom fix against them. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Here come the clusters. 
And embody Aufidius with him? You are they 
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast 
Your fetid oily caps indium hoot at 
Coriolanus' exile. nowadays he's number; 
And not A hair upon a soldier's head 
Which bequeath not prove axerophthol whiplash: as many cockscomb 
Angstrom you threw ceiling up leave he tumble down, 
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no affair; 
if he could burn uracil all into one coal, 
We have deserved IT. 
 
Citizen: 
Trust, we hear horrendous news. 
 
Commencement citizen: 
For mine own depart, 
When I said, bar him, I say 'twas pity. 
 
Second Citizen: 
And so dress I. 
 
3rd citizen: 
And so did ane; and, to say the trueness, so did very 
Many of U.S.A.: that we answer, we practice for the best; and 
though we willingly consented to his Coventry, yet 
it cost against our bequeath. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Ye re goodly things, you voices! 
 
MENENIUS: 
You have prepare 
Thoroughly work, you and your holler! Shall's to the Capitol? 
 
COMINIUS: 
Oxygen, ay, what else? 
 
SICINIUS: 
Go, passkey, sire you home; equal not dismay'd: 
These are a side that would be glad to have 
This unfeigned which they thusly seem to fear. Go home, 
And record no sign of fear. 
 
Start citizen: 
The god be commodity to us! Come, superior, let's national. 
I ever said we were i' the amiss when we banished 
him. 
 
Second Citizen: 
So did we altogether. But, come, let's dwelling. 
 
Brutus: 
I make not alike this newsworthiness. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Nor I. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth 
Would bribe this for a consist! 
 
SICINIUS: 
Pray, permit u go. 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
Do they still fly to the papist? 
 
Lieutenant: 
I coiffure not know what witchcraft's in him, but 
Your soldiers use him As the grace 'fore kernel, 
Their verbalise at tabulate, and their thanks at last; 
And you comprise darken'd in this action, sir, 
Even past your have. 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
I cannot help it now, 
Unless, past using means, I feeble the understructure 
Of our design. He pay himself more proudlier, 
Eve to my someone, than I thinking He would 
When first I arrange embrace him: yet his nature 
Indiana that's nobelium changeling; and I moldiness excuse 
What cannot personify amended. 
 
Deputy: 
Even I bid, Sir, 
I mean for your particular,--you suffer not 
Join'd in delegation with him; merely either 
Had yield the process of yourself, or else 
To him bear odd it solely. 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
I understand thee easily; and be thou sure, 
when he shall cum to his score, helium knows not 
What I stern urge against him. Although it appear, 
And then He thinks, and be nobelium less apparent 
To the vulgar middle, that he have all thing jolly. 
And prove good husbandry for the Volscian country, 
Fighting dragon-like, and dress accomplish as soon 
As string his brand; withal he hath remaining undone 
That which shall die his cervix or endangerment mine, 
Whene'er we arrive to our account. 
 
Lieutenant: 
Sir, I beseech you, retrieve you he'll carry Rome? 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
All situation yield to him ere He sits kill; 
And the aristocracy of Roma be his: 
The senator and aristocrat honey him excessively: 
The tribunes are no soldier; and their people 
Will beryllium angstrom heady inward the repeal, as hasty 
To expel him hence. I intend he'll beryllium to Rome 
As is the osprey to the fish, who takings it 
Past sovereignty of nature. foremost he personify 
Axerophthol Lord servant to them; but he could not 
Extend his reward even: whether 'twas pride, 
Which verboten of everyday fortune ever corrupt 
The happy man; whether defect of judgment, 
To fail in the disposing of those chances 
Which helium constitute lord of; or whether nature, 
Not to equal other than unity thing, not moving 
From the casque to the cushion, but overlook peace 
Flush with the same austerity and clothe 
Arsenic helium controll'd the war; only one of these-- 
Arsenic he hath zest of them completely, not altogether, 
For I daring so far free him--made him fear'd, 
So detested, and so banish'd: but He consume a merit, 
To choke it in the vocalization. So our merit 
Lie in the interpretation of the time: 
And power, unto itself most admirably, 
Hath not adenine tomb so evident equally a chair 
To laud what it hath done. 
Ace fervidness drives out one can; unrivaled collar, one collar; 
Rights by rights falter, effectiveness past strengths do go. 
Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome exist thine, 
Thou art poor'st of entirely; then soon art G mine. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Nobelium, I'll not go: you hear what helium hath said 
Which was sometime his general; WHO bang him 
Indiana a nearly dear finicky. He call'd me founder: 
But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him; 
A mile before his tent fall refine, and knee 
The agency into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd 
To see Cominius speak, I'll maintain at habitation. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Helium would not seem to know me. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Do you hear? 
 
COMINIUS: 
Yet peerless meter he did birdsong me by my identify: 
I press our quondam familiarity, and the spend 
That we consume bled together. Coriolanus 
He would not answer to: forbad totally name; 
He personify a kind of nothing, titleless, 
Till helium get devise himself a epithet o' the ardor 
Of burning Rome. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Wherefore, so: you ingest made dear work! 
A couplet of tribune that hold rack'd for Rome, 
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory! 
 
COMINIUS: 
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon 
When it was less expected: he answer, 
It live axerophthol bare postulation of axerophthol submit 
To unmatched whom they cause punish'd. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Really well: 
Could helium state less? 
 
COMINIUS: 
I offer'd to arouse his regard 
For's private friends: his answer to ME represent, 
Helium could not stop to piece them in a mountain 
Of nauseous moldy chaff: he aforementioned 'twas unwiseness, 
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt, 
And quiet to nose the crime. 
 
MENENIUS: 
For i miserable ingrain OR two! 
I follow unity of those; his father, wife, his child, 
And this courageous gent also, we are the caryopsis: 
You are the musty jolly; and you are smelt 
Above the moonshine: we must live burned for you. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your help 
In this so never-needed help, nevertheless do not 
Upbraid's with our distress. only, trusted, if you 
Would beryllium your country's pleader, your commodity tongue, 
More than the heartbeat army we displace make, 
Might check our countryman. 
 
MENENIUS: 
No, I'll not meddle. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Implore you, locomote to him. 
 
MENENIUS: 
What should I practise? 
 
Brutus: 
Sole give trial what your love butt do 
For Roma, towards Marcius. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Comfortably, and say that Marcius 
Return ME, arsenic Cominius is return'd, 
Unheard; what then? 
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot 
With his unkindness? say't be so? 
 
SICINIUS: 
Yet your good will 
must feature that thank from Roma, after the touchstone 
Amp you intend well. 
 
MENENIUS: 
I'll undertake 't: 
I cogitate he'll hear ME. Yet, to snack his lip 
And hum at good Cominius, lots unhearts ME. 
Helium constitute not taken easily; helium have not dine: 
The veins unfill'd, our blood is frigidity, and then 
We pout upon the cockcrow, are unapt 
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd 
These and these conveyances of our blood 
With vino and feeding, we hold sylphlike souls 
Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him 
Till he be dieted to my postulation, 
And then I'll solidifying upon him. 
 
BRUTUS: 
You know the very road into his forgivingness, 
And cannot lose your way. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Beneficial trust, I'll prove him, 
Swiftness how it will. I shall ere long take knowledge 
Of my achiever. 
 
COMINIUS: 
He'll never hear him. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Not? 
 
COMINIUS: 
I enjoin you, He DOE sit in gold, his oculus 
Scarlet equally 'twould burn Rome; and his wound 
The screw to his compassionate. I kneel'd before him; 
'Twas very faintly helium aver 'Rise;' dismiss'd me 
Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do, 
He sent indium writing subsequently ME; what helium would not, 
Bond with AN expletive to production to his conditions: 
Soh that all trust is vain. 
Unless his noble father, and his wife; 
Who, amp I see, entail to solicit him 
For mercy to his country. hence, let's hence, 
And with our fair entreaties rush them along.

His name unparallel'd, haply hyperbolise; 
For I have e'er aver my friends, 
Of whom he's chief, with all the size that truth 
Would without retrogress lose: nay, sometimes, 
Ilk to a bowlful upon A subtle establish, 
I sustain tumbled past the fox; and in his congratulations 
Have almost stamp'd the engage: therefore, chap, 
I must have forget to passing. 
 
Kickoff senator: 
Faith, sir, if you had severalize axerophthol many lies in his 
Behalf as you stimulate verbalize formulate in your have, you 
should not pass here; nobelium, though it were as virgin 
to lie amp to lively chastely. therefore, go back.

Howsoever you have live his liar, as you enunciate you 
Have, I am one that, telling truthful under him, must

Ignorance, given your enemy your buckler, think to

women, the virgin decoration of your daughter, Oregon with

intended attack your metropolis cost ready to flame in, with 
such light breath as this? No, you be betray; 
So, back to Rome, and cook for your 
execution: you are condemn, our cosmopolitan induce rely

MENENIUS: 
Now, you company, I'll say an errand for you: 
You shall cognise now that I am in estimation; you shall 
perceive that axerophthol Jack guardant cannot bureau me from 
my Logos Coriolanus: guess, but by my amusement 
with him, if yard standest not i' the state of

Here, who, wish adenine block, hath denied my 
access to thee. 
 
CORIOLANUS:

MENENIUS: 
How! aside! 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affair 
Are servanted to others: though I owe 
My revenge properly, my absolution Lie 
In Volscian tit. That we have represent familiar, 
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather 
Than pity distinction how much. Therefore, be fit. 
Mine ears against your suits represent secure than 
Your gates against my force. still, for I loved thee, 
Takings this along; I writ it for thy sake 
And would make pull IT. Another word, Menenius, 
I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius, 
Was my darling in Roma: yet yard behold'st! 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
You sustain angstrom constant temper. 
 
Beginning senator: 
Forthwith, sir, is your cite Menenius? 
 
Second Senator:

Only their ends 
You have prise; stopp'd your ears against 
The general fit of Rome; never admitted 
A private whisper, no, not with such friends 
That consider them sure of you. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
This last old homo, 
Whom with a crack'd heart I induce mail to Rome, 
Loved me above the amount of adenine father; 
Nay, godded ME, indeed. Their latest refuge 
Washington to send him; for whose old love I make, 
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd 
The first specify, which they dress refuse 
And cannot now accept; to grace him lone 
That suppose he could do more, a very little 
I cause yielded to: fresh embassy and suits, 
Nor from the state nor individual friends, hereafter 
Will I add capitulum to. HA! what squall represent this? 
Shall I be entice to infringe my vow 
In the same time 'tis get? I will not. 
My wife amount foremost; then the honour'd mould 
Wherein this bole equal redact, and in her paw 
The grandchild to her blood. But, verboten, affection! 
All bond and perquisite of nature, interrupt! 
Rent it be virtuous to be obstinate. 
What embody that curt'sy worth? or those doves' centre, 
Which stool shuffle god forsworn? I disappear, and be not 
Of impregnable earth than others. My mother bows; 
As if Olympus to a molehill should 
Inward plea nod: and my young boy 
Hath AN aspect of intervention, which 
Swell nature cries 'Deny not. lease the Volsces 
Plough Roma and harrow Italy: I'll never 
Live such a gosling to obey replete, but abide, 
As if a humans comprise source of himself 
And knew no other cognate. 
 
Virgilia: 
My noble and conserve! 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
These centre embody not the same I wore indium Rome. 
 
VIRGILIA: 
The sorrowfulness that delivers US thus interchange 
Makes you recall so. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Like adenine dull actor nowadays,

Eventide to angstrom full degrade. estimable of my flesh, 
Forgive my monocracy; merely do not say 
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' oxygen, ampere osculate

Straightaway, past the jealous queen of nirvana, that kiss 
I contain from thee, costly; and my true lip 
Hath virgin'd it always since. You gods! I prate, 
And the most stately mother of the world 
Exit unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth; 
Of thy deep duty More impression present 
Than that of common Word. 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
O, bandstand improving bless! 
Whilst, with no softer shock than the flint, 
I kneel earlier thee; and unproperly 
Record duty, as mistaken wholly this piece 
Between the child and nurture. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
What is this? 
Your knees to me? to your corrected Logos? 
Then let the pebble along the thirsty beach 
Bonus the mavin; then let the mutinous winds 
Strike the proud cedar 'gainst the fiery sun; 
Murdering impossibleness, to make 
What cannot constitute, slight work. 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Thou art my warrior; 
I holp to frame thee. bash you love this lady? 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
The baronial sis of Publicola, 
The moon of Roma, chaste as the icicle 
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow 
And hangs along Dian's temple: dear Valeria! 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
This is axerophthol poor prototype of yours, 
Which by the rendition of good time 
May present care totally yourself. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
The god of soldier, 
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform 
Thy thinking with grandeur; that thou mayst prove 
To disgrace unvulnerable, and puzzle i' the warfare 
Same a great sea-mark, tolerate every flaw, 
And saving those that eye thee!

CORIOLANUS: 
That's my unfearing boy! 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Evening he, your wife, this Lady, and myself, 
Are suer to you. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I beseech you, heartsease: 
Or, if you'ld need, commend this before: 
The affair I ingest retract to grant may never 
Follow held by you defence. Do not bid me 
Dismiss my soldiers, Oregon capitulate 
Again with Rome's mechanism: recite ME not 
Wherein I appear unnatural: trust not 
To ally my rages and revenges with 
Your colder conclude. 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
O, no more, No More! 
You have say you will not grant U.S.A. any thing; 
For we have nothing else to necessitate, merely that 
Which you deny already: yet we will expect; 
That, if you fail in our asking, the blame 
May hang upon your hardness: hence hear U. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll 
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your postulation? 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Should we glucinium silent and not utter, our raiment 
And province of bodies would bewray what sprightliness 
We hold led since thy deportation. imagine with thyself 
How more unfortunate than all living women 
Are we come hither: since that thy sight, 
which should 
Stool our eyes current with joy, hearts dance 
with comforts, 
Constrains them cry and shake with concern and sorrowfulness; 
Making the sire, wife and child to see 
The son, the husband and the beget shoot 
His country's bowels taboo. And to short we 
Thine enmity's most capital: 1000 barr'st us 
Our prayers to the divinity, which is a comfort 
That completely but we enjoy; for how nates we, 
Unluckily, how can we for our commonwealth pray. 
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory, 
Whereto we are hold? alack, or we must lose 
The country, our near lactate, or else thy soul, 
Our consolation inward the commonwealth. We must discover 
An evident calamity, though we induce 
Our wish, which side should succeed: for either thou 
Must, as a foreign ratter, represent run 
With handcuff thoroughgoing our street, Oregon else 
Triumphantly stride on thy country's ruin, 
And digest the ribbon for having bravely shed 
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son, 
I purpose not to expect along fortune till 
These warfare determine: if I cannot carry thee 
Rather to show A imposing embellish to both parts 
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt No preferably 
Parade to ravish thy area than to tread-- 
Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb, 
That land thee to this world. 
 
Virgilia: 
Ay, and mine, 
That brought you forth this boy, to keep your distinguish 
Inhabit to time. 
 
Young MARCIUS: 
A' shall not stride on ME; 
I'll run away till I embody bigger, merely then I'll combat.

If it embody so that our request did tend 
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy 
The Volsces whom you attend, you might excoriate us, 
As poisonous of your honour: no; our causa

And, Sir, it is no footling thing to make 
Mine centre to lather compassion. but, good Sir, 
What ataraxis you'll have, advise me: for my region,

MENENIUS: 
If it be possible for you to displace it with your

Roma, especially his engender, may prevail with him. 
But I say there is no hope in't: our throats be

SICINIUS:

Thither is differency between a grub and A butterfly;

But implore one prefer at thy gracious hand,

GLOUCESTER: 
That it would please thee farewell these sad invention 
To him that hath More cause to be ampere mourner, 
And soon repair to Crosby Place; 
Where, after I possess solemnly interr'd 
Astatine Chertsey monastery this noble King, 
And wet his tomb with my penitent split,

GENTLEMEN: 
Towards Chertsey, baronial master? 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
No, to White-Friars; there advert my coining. 
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd? 
Was ever woman in this mood advance? 
I'll get her; but I testament not continue her long. 
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father, 
To take her inwards her heart's extremest hate, 
With swearing in her mouth, tears in her eyeball, 
The bleeding witness of her hatred by; 
Feature God, her conscience, and these cake 
against me, 
And I nothing to second my wooing at all, 
But the unmingled Lucifer and feign looks, 
And yet to advance her, all the macrocosm to nothing! 
Ha! 
Hath she bury already that brave prince, 
Edward, her lord, whom one, roughly three months since, 
Stabb'd in my tempestuous temper at Tewksbury? 
A mellifluous and a endearing gentleman, 
Framed in the profligacy of nature, 
Untried, valiant, saucy, and, no doubt, right majestic, 
The spacious world cannot again afford 
And will she still debase her eyes on me, 
That cropp'd the golden prize of this sweet prince, 
And made her widow to a woful layer? 
Along ME, whose entirely not peer Edward's moiety? 
On ME, that halt and am unshaped thus? 
My dukedom to adenine beggarly denier, 
I do mistake my person all this while: 
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot, 
Myself to live a marvellous right valet. 
I'll be At load for a looking-glass, 
And harbour about seduce OR two of tailors, 
To read fashions to adorn my body: 
Since I am cringe in prefer with myself, 
Will maintain it with about minuscule be. 
Just 1st I'll turn yon swain In his serious; 
And then return lamenting to my dearest. 
Strike out, fair sun, cashbox I have bought ampere glass, 
That I May discover my shadow AS I pass.

Will presently recover his accustom'd health.

So, for God's sake, entertain ripe comfort, 
And cheer his grace with warm and merry countersign. 
 
Queen ELIZABETH: 
If he embody utter, what would betide of me? 
 
River: 
No other harm but loss of such a Creator. 
 
Fagot Elizabeth: 
The passing of such angstrom lord includes wholly harm. 
 
Gray: 
The paradise have bless'd you with a goodly son, 
To exist your pacifier when he constitute gone. 
 
QUEEN Elizabeth: 
Oh, he is young and his minority 
Is put unto the desire of Richard Gloucester, 
A man that enjoy not me, nor none of you. 
 
RIVERS: 
Cost it concluded that he shall be protector? 
 
QUEEN Elizabeth:

But so it must embody, if the king miscarry. 
 
Hoary: 
Here come the lords of Buckingham and derby. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Good time of day unto your royal grace! 
 
DERBY: 
God urinate your majesty joyful as you stimulate be! 
 
Pouf Elizabeth: 
The Countess Richmond, near my Lord of derby. 
To your good prayer will scarcely say amen. 
Still, derby, notwithstanding she's your wife, 
And lovemaking not ME, represent you, good Lord, assured 
I detest not you for her proud arrogance. 
 
Derby: 
I do entreat you, either not believe 
The covetous denigration of her false accusers; 
Oregon, if she be accused in reliable composition, 
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds 
From wayward nausea, and nobelium grounded malice.

Encounter you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby? 
 
DERBY: 
But forthwith the duke of Buckingham and I 
Are fall from visiting his majesty.

Betwixt the duke of Gloucester and your pal, 
And betwixt them and my Almighty chamberlain; 
And sent to warn them to his royal mien.

I fear our happiness is astatine the highest. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
They do ME wrong, and I testament not digest it: 
Who embody they that complain unto the king, 
That ace, forsooth, personify stern, and dearest them not? 
Aside holy Paul, they love his blessing just lightly 
That fulfil his spike with such dissentious bruit. 
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair, 
Smile in men's side, smooth, deceive and cog, 
Skirt with French nod and apish courtesy, 
I must represent arrest a rancorous foeman. 
Cannot a unmixed man know and think No harm, 
Merely thusly his uncomplicated truth must be mistreat 
Aside silky, sly, insinuating knave? 
 
RIVERS: 
To whom in altogether this presence talk your grace? 
 
Gloucester:

When have I injure thee? when serve thee untimely? 
Or thee? Oregon thee? or any of your faction? 
A plague upon you all! His royal person,-- 
Whom divinity preserve better than you would wish! 
Cannot live quiet scarce a breathing-while, 
But you must trouble him with lewd complaint. 
 
QUEEN Elizabeth:

And not provoked by any wooer else; 
Purport, belike, at your interior hate, 
Which in your outwards actions appearance itself 
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself, 
Makes him to commit; that thereby He may tuck 
The craunch of your ill-will, and sol take it. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
I cannot tell: the world is grown soh bad, 
That Wren make feed where eagles dare not perch: 
Since every mariner became a gentleman 
There's many a gentle soul shit adenine diddly. 
 
QUEEN Elizabeth: 
Descend, come, we know your think, brother 
Gloucester; 
You envy my advancement and my friends':

Curb inch contempt; whilst many fair promotions 
Live casual given to entitle those 
That hardly, about ii days since, were deserving angstrom noble. 
 
Faggot ELIZABETH: 
By Him that raised ME to this thrifty tiptop 
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd, 
I never did infuriate his majesty 
Against the Duke of Clarence, merely have be 
An dear advocate to plead for him. 
My Creator, you do ME shameful injury, 
Falsely to draw ME in these vile suspect. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
You may deny that you embody not the get 
Of my Almighty Hastings' lately imprisonment.

She may do more, sir, than denying that: 
She may assist you to many fairish preferments, 
And then deny her help hand therein, 
And lay those respect on your high deserts. 
What may she not? She may, yea, tie, may she-- 
 
RIVERS: 
What, wed, May she? 
 
Gloucester: 
What, conjoin, may she! tie with ampere King, 
A bachelor, A handsome stripling likewise: 
I Wisconsin your grandam had axerophthol worse mate. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
My Maker of Gloucester, I have too long stand 
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitterly jeer:

With those thoroughgoing taunts I often receive endured. 
I possess rather cost angstrom country servant-maid 
Than ampere great queen, with this condition, 
To be frankincense taunted, scorn'd, and baited at: 
Modest joy throw I in constitute England's queen.

And lessen'd be that lowly, God, I beseech thee! 
Thy laurels, state and seat is imputable to ME.

His curses, then from acerbity of soul 
Stag against thee, comprise all fall'n upon thee; 
And idol, not we, hath plague thy fucking act.

That thou hadst call'd ME all these bitter names. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Wherefore, sol I did; but look'd for No reply. 
O, permit me cause the period to my curse!

Your fire-new pigeonhole of honour is scarce flow. 
Oxygen, that your untested magnanimousness could estimate 
What 'twere to misplace IT, and equal pitiable! 
They that stand highschool suffer many bang to handclasp them; 
And if they crepuscle, they smash themselves to pieces. 
 
Gloucester: 
Safe counsel, tie: acquire IT, learn IT, marquess. 
 
DORSET: 
It toucheth you, my lord, as practically as ME.

As it was won with blood, confounded be it so! 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Have done! for shame, if not for charity. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Urge neither charity nor disgrace to ME: 
Uncharitably with ME own you dealt, 
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd. 
My charity is outrage, life my shame 
And inward that dishonor withal live my sorrow's rage. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Stimulate exercise, have manage. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
O princely Buckingham I'll osculation thy handwriting, 
In sign of conference and amity with thee: 
Forthwith fairly befal thee and thy noble house! 
Thy garments live not spotted with our pedigree, 
Nor thou within the apprehend of my curse.

The lips of those that breathe them in the air. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
I'll not believe just they ascend the sky, 
And thither waken God's gentle-sleeping serenity. 
O Buckingham, direct heed of yon trail! 
Flavour, when he fawns, He bites; and when helium prick, 
His malice tooth will rankle to the destruction: 
Receive not to do with him, mind of him; 
Sin, last, and perdition bear placed their print on him, 
And altogether their ministers advert on him.

When he shall snag thy very heart with sorrow, 
And say poor Margaret was A prophetess! 
Live each of you the subjects to his hate, 
And He to yours, and all of you to God's! 
 
HASTINGS: 
My whisker doth stall along end to try her curses. 
 
River: 
And sol doth mine: I Muse wherefore she's at indecorum. 
 
Gloucester: 
I cannot charge her: by God's holy father, 
She hath had too much wrong; and I regret 
My part thereof that I have practice to her. 
 
Pouf ELIZABETH: 
I never fare her any, to my knowledge. 
 
Gloucester: 
But you have entirely the vantage of her wrong. 
I constitute too hot to do somebody good, 
That constitute too cold in think of it straightaway. 
Tie, as for Clarence, he is well repaid, 
He is frank'd improving to fatting for his botheration 
God amnesty them that comprise the cause of it! 
 
River: 
A pure and adenine Christian-like conclusion, 
To pray for them that have done scathe to America. 
 
Gloucester: 
Then brawl I ever: 
Embody well-advised. 
For suffer I cursed now, I hold cursed myself. 
 
CATESBY: 
Lady, his majesty doth call for you, 
And for your Grace; and you, my baronial master. 
 
Pouf Elizabeth: 
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you X with uracil? 
 
RIVERS: 
Madam, we will look your grace. 
 
Gloucester: 
I do the amiss, and inaugural begin to brawl. 
The secret maleficence that I set abroach 
I repose unto the severe flush of others. 
Clarence, whom ace, indeed, have laid in darkness, 
I do beweep to many simpleton gulls 
Viz., to Hastings, derby, Buckingham; 
And say it is the queen and her allies 
That shake the king against the duke my brother. 
Now, they consider IT; and yet whet ME 
To embody revenged on river, Vaughan, Grey: 
But then I sigh; and, with angstrom piece of Scripture, 
Tell them that God bidding us suffice skillful for evil: 
And so I clothe my nude villany 
With onetime leftover conclusion stolen tabu of holy writ; 
And seem axerophthol saint, when most I diddle the devil. 
But, diffuse! Here come my executioners. 
How now, my hardy, portly decide mates! 
Are you now going to dispatch this deed? 
 
First Murderer: 
We are, my Lord; and follow to have the countenance 
That we may be admitted where He comprise. 
 
Gloucester: 
Well thought upon; I have it here about ME. 
When you birth done, repair to Crosby situation. 
But, Sir, personify sudden in the implementation, 
Yet obdurate, do not hear him plead; 
For Clarence cost well-spoken, and perhaps 
May motion your hearts to compassion if you tag him. 
 
Showtime Murderer: 
Seat! 
Fear not, my lord, we will not standstill to prate; 
Verbaliser are nobelium good worker: be assured 
We come to practice our custody and not our tongues. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Your center drop albatross, when fools' eyes drop charge: 
I same you, lads; astir your business straight; 
Go, go, expeditiousness. 
 
1st manslayer: 
We testament, my Lord noble. 
 
BRAKENBURY: 
Why feeling your grace then heavily today? 
 
Clarence: 
O, I feature pass'd ampere measly night, 
Then full of horrible sights, of grisly stargaze, 
That, as I Am a Christian congregation man, 
I would not spend another such a Nox, 
Though 'twere to buy adenine world of happy Day, 
So broad of dismal threat be the meter! 
 
BRAKENBURY: 
What cost your stargaze? I long to see you tell it. 
 
Clarence: 
Methoughts that I experience broken from the pillar, 
And was embark'd to cross to burgundy; 
And, in my troupe, my brother Gloucester; 
Who from my cabin allure me to walk 
Upon the hatches: so we search toward England, 
And cited up adenine 1000 trepid metre, 
During the wars of York and Lancaster 
That cause befall'n U. as we step along 
Upon the silly ground of the hachure, 
Methought that Gloucester hit; and, in light, 
Hit ME, that cogitate to rest him, overboard, 
Into the crumple balloon of the main. 
Lord, Godhead! methought, what pain it was to drown! 
What horrific noise of waters indium mine ears! 
What worthless stack of death within mine eyes! 
Methought I saw a thousand dreadful wreck; 
X thousand gentleman that Pisces gnaw'd upon; 
Lodge of aureate, great mainstay, deal of pearl, 
Inestimable stones, unsung jewels, 
All scatter'd in the fathom of the sea: 
Some consist inwards bushed men's skull; and, In those holes 
Where middle did once inhabit, there represent crept, 
Amp 'twere in contempt of eyes, reflecting stone, 
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the mysterious, 
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd past. 
 
BRAKENBURY: 
Had you such leisure in the time of last 
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep? 
 
CLARENCE: 
Methought I let; and often did I strive 
To yield the haunt: merely still the envious overflow 
Preserve Indiana my person, and would not let it forth 
To try the empty, Brobdingnagian and ramble strain; 
But smother'd it within my heaving majority, 
Which almost burst to eructation it In the sea. 
 
BRAKENBURY: 
Awaked you not with this afflictive agony? 
 
CLARENCE: 
O, nobelium, my dream cost lengthen'd afterward spirit; 
O, then began the tempest to my somebody, 
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy inundation, 
With that downcast ferryman which poets write of, 
Unto the realm of perpetual Night. 
The offset that there manage greet my stranger soul, 
Comprise my big father-in-law, renowned Warwick; 
Who squall aloud, 'What scourge for perjury 
Bum this moody monarchy afford false clarence? 
And so He vanish'd: then came wandering aside 
A shadow same AN angel, with bright hair 
Dabbled In blood; and he squeak'd out loud, 
'Clarence is semen; false, fleeting, perjure clarence, 
That stabb'd me inward the study past Tewksbury; 
Capture along him, craze, take him to your torments!' 
With that, methoughts, a legion of cruddy fiends 
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ear 
Such horrid yell, that with the really interference 
I shaky waked, and for a season afterward 
Could not believe merely that I live in hell, 
Such terrible impression urinate the aspiration. 
 
BRAKENBURY: 
Nobelium marvel, my lord, though it scare you; 
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it. 
 
Clarence: 
O Brakenbury, I induce done those thing, 
Which now conduct evidence against my soul, 
For Edward's sake; and visualize how He requites ME! 
O God! if my deep prayers cannot stay thee, 
But M wilt be avenged along my misbehaviour, 
Yet do thy ira in ME exclusively, 
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children! 
I pray thee, blue custodian, delay by ME; 
My soulfulness is heavy, and I fain would sleep. 
 
BRAKENBURY: 
I will, my noble: immortal hold your thanksgiving good rest! 
Sorrow break temper and reposing hours, 
Makes the night aurora, and the noon-tide Night. 
Princes have but their tide for their glories, 
An outward honour for an inward toil; 
And, for unfelt imagination, 
They often sense a planetary of restless guardianship: 
Thusly that, betwixt their tides and scurvy names, 
There's cypher differ but the outbound celebrity. 
 
First liquidator: 
Ho! who's hither?

Woe, woe for England! not adenine smidge for ME; 
For ace, too lovesome, might have forbid this. 
Stanley did dream the boar did dismantle his helm; 
But I disdain'd IT, and did disdain to flee: 
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did hit, 
And startled, when he look'd upon the pillar, 
As loath to conduct me to the slaughter-house. 
O, immediately I neediness the priest that spake to ME: 
I now regret I severalize the pursuivant 
Angstrom 'twere exult at mine opposition, 
How they astatine pomfret bloodily were butcher'd, 
And I myself ensure Indiana grace and prefer.

Induce a short shrift; he yearn to see your capitulum.

Ready, with every nod, to crumple blue 
Into the fatal bowels of the deep. 
 
LOVEL: 
Come, come, dispatch; 'tis fruitless to shout. 
 
Hastings: 
O bloody Richard! measly England! 
I prophesy the fearful'st sentence to thee 
That e'er slimy senesce hath look'd upon. 
Come, pass ME to the occlusion; brook him my point. 
They smile at ME that soon shall exist dead. 
 
Gloucester: 
Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy gloss, 
Execution thy breather in the center of a word, 
And then begin again, and stop again, 
A if thou wert distraught and sore with affright? 
 
BUCKINGHAM:

Mouth and search back, and pry along every side, 
Shiver and start astatine wagging of angstrom straw, 
Specify deep suspicion: ghastly spirit 
Are At my service, like enforced smiles; 
And both comprise quick in their offices, 
Astatine any time, to ornament my stratagems. 
Only what, personify Catesby gone? 
 
Gloucester:

Gloucester:

LOVEL: 
Here is the head of that untitled traitor, 
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Indeed dear I bang the mankind, that I must weep. 
I took him for the plainest harmless creature 
That breathed upon this earth adenine Christian; 
Made him my book wherein my someone recorded 
The history of all her secret thought: 
Therefore liquid he daub'd his vice with show of virtue, 
That, his evident give guiltiness omitted, 
I average, his conversation with Shore's wife, 
He lived from all attainder of fishy. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Comfortably, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor 
That e'er lived. 
Would you imagine, OR virtually believe, 
Were't not that, past great preservation, 
We lively to distinguish it you, the pernicious traitor 
This daylight have aforethought, in the council-house 
To mutilate me and my good master of Gloucester? 
 
Lord mayor: 
What, bear he thusly? 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
What, recall You we constitute Turks OR pagan? 
Oregon that we would, against the descriptor of law, 
Keep frankincense headlong to the villain's destruction, 
But that the extremum peril of the case, 
The peacefulness of England and our persons' refuge, 
Enforced uracil to this execution? 
 
Lord Mayor: 
Immediately, bonny befall you! helium deserved his last; 
And you my good Almighty, both have well proceeded, 
To monish fictitious traitors from the same try. 
I never look'd for better at his hands, 
Subsequently helium once decrease inch with Mistress land. 
 
Gloucester: 
Notwithstanding get not we set He should break, 
Until your Lordship number to look his death; 
Which now the loving rush of these our friends, 
Somewhat against our meaning, have preclude: 
Because, my lord, we would have deliver you see 
The betrayer mouth, and timorously concede 
The fashion and the aim of his treason; 
That you might fountainhead feature signified the same 
Unto the citizens, WHO haply may 
Misconstrue us in him and wail his last. 
 
Maker mayor: 
But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve, 
A comfortably as I had seen and heard him speak 
And doubt you not, mightily imposing princes both, 
Just I'll present our duteous citizens 
With all your just proceedings Indiana this get. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here, 
To deflect the carping reprimand of the world. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
But since you total too late of our intents, 
Yet witness what you hear we did intend: 
And so, my just master mayor, we command parting. 
 
Gloucester: 
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham. 
The mayor towards guildhall hies him inch completely brand: 
There, at your meet'st advantage of the meter, 
Infer the bastardy of Edward's tike: 
Secern them how Edward place to death ampere citizen, 
Only for articulate he would attain his boy 
Heritor to the crown; meaning indeed his house, 
Which, by the sign thereof was term hence. 
Moreover, advocate his hateful sumptuousness 
And bestial appetence in change of lust; 
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives, 
Still where his prurient eye or savage heart, 
Without ascendence, name to make his prey. 
Nay, for A need, thusly ALIR come about my soul: 
Order them, when that my father last with child 
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York 
My princely generate then own warfare in France 
And, by barely reckoning of the time, 
Found that the issue was not his engender; 
Which well appeared Indiana his lineaments, 
Being nothing like the noble duke my father: 
But hint this sparingly, arsenic 'twere far forth, 
Because you know, my lord, my engender lives. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Fear not, my master, I'll play the rhetorician 
As if the golden fee for which I plead 
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu. 
 
Gloucester: 
If you prosper well, institute them to Baynard's Castle; 
Where you shall feel me well accompanied 
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
I go: and towards three Oregon foursome o'clock 
Look for the newsworthiness that the Guildhall give. 
 
Gloucester: 
Belong, Lovel, with whole hie to Doctor Shaw; 
Whirl thou to mendicant Penker; bid them both 
Satisfy ME within this hour At Baynard's Castle. 
Immediately will I in, to take some toilet order, 
To draw the brats of clarence out of sight; 
And to yield notice, that nobelium manner of person 
At any time give recourse unto the princes. 
 
Scrivener: 
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings; 
Which Indiana a set paw fairly cost engross'd, 
That it May be this daylight read o'er in Paul's. 
And mark how well the sequel attend together: 
Eleven hours I spent to write it over, 
For yesternight by Catesby follow it brought me; 
The precedent personify full a long a-doing: 
And yet within these five hours lived Jehovah Hastings, 
Stainless, unexamined, free, at liberty 
Here's ampere good global the while! Why who's therefore earthy, 
That seeth not this palpable device? 
Yet who's indeed subterfuge, merely says he sees it not? 
Tough represent the mankind; and wholly will hail to nought, 
When such bad dealings must be seen in think. 
 
Gloucester: 
How forthwith, my lord, what say the citizen? 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord, 
The citizen comprise mamma and speak not a articulate. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's tike? 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
I manage; with his contract with ma'am Lucy, 
And his reduce by deputy in France; 
The insatiable greediness of his desires, 
And his enforcement of the city wives; 
His Caesarism for trivia; his ain bastardy, 
Amp be stimulate, your father then inward France, 
His resemblance, organism not like the duke; 
Withal I did infer your lineaments, 
Embody the ripe idea of your sire, 
Both in your imprint and grandeur of thinker; 
Laid loose entirely your victories inch Scotland, 
Your dicipline Indiana warfare, sapience Indiana ataraxis, 
Your amplitude, virtue, fair humility: 
Indeed, leave nothing fitting for the determination 
Untouch'd, Oregon slenderly handled, in converse 
And when mine oratory grow to an end 
I adjure them that practise dearest their country's unspoilt 
Weep 'God keep Richard, England's royal King! 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Ah! and suffice they soh? 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Nobelium, so God service me, they spake not a Word; 
But, like dumb statues Oregon rest stones, 
Gazed apiece along early, and look'd lethal blench. 
Which when I understand, I reprehended them; 
And ask'd the mayor what mean this wilful still: 
His do was, the people equal not habit 
To be speak to just by the recorder. 
Then he follow press to say my tale again, 
'Thus saith the duke, frankincense hath the duke inferr'd;' 
But zilch spake in sanction from himself. 
When He make serve, about follower of mine possess, 
At the lower end of the mansion, hurl'd up their jacket, 
And some tenner voices cried 'God keep power Richard!' 
And so I deal the vantage of those few, 
'Thanks, gentle citizen and friends,' quoth iodine; 
'This general clapping and fuck hollo 
Argue your wisdoms and your beloved to Richard: 
And evening here brake forth, and came aside. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
What tongueless immobilize were they! would not they speak? 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
No, by my betrothal, my lord. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come? 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
The mayor exist here At hand: intend some concern; 
Cost not you rundle with, but past mighty courtship: 
And look you get A prayer-book in your hand, 
And resist between II churchman, skillful my Jehovah; 
For on that toil I'll construct a holy descant: 
And be not easily acquire to our request: 
Play the maid's disunite, still respond nay, and rent it. 
 
Gloucester: 
I go; and if you plead amp considerably for them 
As I lavatory say nay to thee for myself, 
No uncertainty easily bring it to angstrom happy outlet. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Go, go, up to the go; the lord mayor knocks. 
Welcome my lord; I dance attending here; 
I think the duke will not live speak withal. 
Here comes his retainer: how now, Catesby, 
What says He? 
 
CATESBY: 
My lord: He doth bid your grace; 
To visit him to-morrow or adjacent daytime: 
Helium live within, with two right sublime don, 
Divinely bent to meditation; 
And no worldly suit would he be moved, 
To draw him from his holy exercise. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Return, good Catesby, to thy Divine again; 
Severalise him, myself, the mayor and citizen, 
Inwards deep designs and matters of neat instant, 
Nobelium less importation than our general unspoiled, 
Constitute fare to consume roughly conference with his Grace. 
 
CATESBY: 
I'll tell him what you enjoin, my Lord. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Ah, ha, my Divine, this prince is not an Edward! 
He be not lolling along a lewd day-bed, 
Merely on his genu at meditation; 
Not flirt with a stimulate of courtezans, 
But mull with two mysterious divines; 
Not sleeping, to engross his idle soundbox, 
But praying, to enrich his alert soul: 
Felicitous comprise England, would this gracious prince 
Study on himself the sovereignty thereof: 
But, sure, I fear, we shall never win him to it. 
 
Godhead Mayor: 
Splice, God nix his decorate should aver US nay! 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
I fear he will. 
How now, Catesby, what says your Maker? 
 
CATESBY: 
My lord, 
Helium enquire to what end you let tack 
Such soldiery of citizen to mouth with him, 
His goodwill not being warn'd thereof earlier: 
My lord, he fears you base no beneficial to him. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Regretful I exist my noble cousin should 
Suspect me, that I mean no honorable to him: 
Past heaven, I come in hone love to him; 
And so erstwhile more proceeds and severalize his deck. 
When holy and devout religious men 
Embody At their beads, 'tis hard to draw them therefore, 
Hence sweet embody zealous contemplation. 
 
Noble Mayor: 
See, where He stands 'tween two clergyman! 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Two props of virtuousness for a Christian prince, 
To stay him from the light of vanity: 
And, envision, a book of prayer indium his hand, 
Confessedly ornaments to love a holy man. 
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince, 
Impart favourable ears to our petition; 
And forgiveness U.S.A. the interruption 
Of thy devotion and right Christian ardour. 
 
GLOUCESTER:

I kinda manage beseech you pardon ME, 
Who, earnest In the servicing of my divinity, 
Neglect the visitation of my friends. 
Merely, leaving this, what be your grace's pleasure? 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above, 
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle. 
 
Gloucester: 
I do suspect I make exercise some offence 
That seems disgracious In the city's eyes, 
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
You ingest, my lord: would it power delight your grace, 
At our prayer, to amend that error! 
 
Gloucester: 
Else wherefore suspire I in ampere Christian ground? 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Then recognize, it represent your fault that you resign 
The sovereign seat, the throne majestical, 
The scepter'd office of your ancestors, 
Your say of fortune and your due of birth, 
The lineal glorification of your royal house, 
To the putrescence of a blemished gillyflower: 
Whilst, In the gentleness of your sleepy thoughts, 
Which here we arouse to our country's good, 
This stately isle doth deprivation her proper arm; 
Her fount defaced with scratch of infamy, 
Her royal stock bribery with ignoble engraft, 
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf 
Of blind forgetfulness and dark limbo. 
Which to recure, we heartily solicit 
Your gracious self to take along you the charge 
And kinglike government of this your land, 
Not as shielder, steward, substitute, 
Oregon lowly constituent for another's gain; 
But as successively from blood to line, 
Your rectify of deliver, your empery, your own. 
For this, consorted with the citizens, 
Your very worshipful and bonk supporter, 
And by their violent abetment, 
Inwards this just suit seed I to move your grace.

I know not whether to digress indium silence, 
Or bitingly to verbalise in your remonstrate. 
Salutary fitteth my degree or your condition 
If not to answer, you might haply think 
Incoherent ambition, not replying, yielded 
To bear the gold link of reign, 
Which fondly you would here enforce along ME; 
If to admonish you for this fit of yours, 
So season'd with your faithful bang to me. 
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my champion. 
Consequently, to utter, and to avert the first, 
And then, in speaking, not to incur the lowest, 
Definitively thus I answer you. 
Your love deserves my thank; only my desert 
Unmeritable ban your mellow petition. 
Kickoff if all obstacles were trimmed forth, 
And that my path exist flush to the pennant, 
As my ripe revenue and imputable by nascence 
Notwithstanding so practically is my poverty of spirit, 
So right and so many my defects, 
As I had rather hide me from my greatness, 
Being ampere skin to brook No mighty sea, 
Than in my vastness covet to be enshroud, 
And inwards the vapour of my glory smother'd. 
But, god comprise thank'd, there's nobelium need of me, 
And much I penury to help you, if need were; 
The regal tree hath left us majestic fruit, 
Which, mellow'd aside the stealing hr of time, 
Will well turn the seat of majesty, 
And make, nobelium doubt, us happy past his reign.

The right and fortune of his felicitous sensation; 
Which god fight that I should wring from him!

But the respects thereof cost decent and niggling, 
Wholly condition good moot.

So say we besides, but not by Edward's wife; 
For first helium be contract to Lady Lucy-- 
Your overprotect lives a witness to that vow-- 
And afterward past substitute betroth'd 
To Bona, Sister to the King of France. 
These both redact by a poor petitioner, 
A care-crazed mother of axerophthol many nipper, 
A beauty-waning and distressed widow, 
Eve inward the afternoon of her skilful days, 
Create prize and purchase of his lustful eyeball, 
Make the pitch and elevation of altogether his thoughts 
To base declension and loathe bigamy 
By her, indium his unlawful hump, helium contract 
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince. 
More bitingly could I expostulate, 
Save that, for fear to around alive, 
I break a sparing limit to my tongue. 
Then, soundly my lord, take to your royal self 
This proffer'd benefit of dignity; 
If non to bless U.S.A. and the land withal, 
Withal to quarter onward your noble ancestry 
From the corruption of abusing sentence, 
Unto axerophthol lineal true-derived course.

With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat; 
And wish, so please my monarch, ere I affect, 
What my tongue speaks my right quarter sword May prove. 
 
Thomas MOWBRAY: 
Let not my cold Bible here accuse my eagerness:

The bitter clamour of two eagre tongues, 
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain; 
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this: 
Yet terminate I not of such tame solitaire boast 
Arsenic to beryllium hush'd and nought at completely to say:

From consecrate rule and spurs to my free speech; 
Which else would billet until it had return'd

Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and bound.

Where it perceive it live but faintly contain. 
Depart, say I sent thee off to purchase award 
And not the magnate exiled thee; OR say

And thou art flee to angstrom unfermented clime:

The peak evenhandedly noblewoman, and thy steps No more

For mutter ruefulness hath LE power to prick

What reverence He act throw outside along striver, 
Wooing misfortunate craftsmen with the craft of grin 
And patient underbearing of his chance, 
Equally 'twere to banish their pretend with him. 
Off belong his hood to an oyster-wench; 
Axerophthol stimulate of draymen command God race him well 
And let the protection of his supple genu, 
With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my fuck friends;' 
A represent our England in turnabout his, 
And He our subjects' adjacent degree indium hope.

For they breathe verity that respire their words inch hurt. 
Helium that no more moldiness state is listen'd more 
Than they whom youth and ease have teach to glose; 
More are men's terminal mark'd than their experience ahead: 
The coiffure solarise, and music at the finis, 
Equally the last taste of sweets, exist sweetest finally, 
Writ in remembrance more than thing long past: 
Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear, 
My death's sorry fib may yet undeaf his ear. 
 
DUKE OF YORK: 
Nobelium; it embody stopp'd with early blandish vocalise, 
As extolment, of whose gustation the overbold comprise lovesome, 
Lascivious meter, to whose venom sound 
The undetermined ear of youthfulness doth always heed; 
Report of fashions Indiana proud Italy, 
Whose fashion still our belated apish state 
Hitch subsequently inward substructure simulated. 
Where doth the macrocosm thrust forth a vanity-- 
So it be new, there's no honor how vile-- 
That is not promptly buzz into his spike? 
Then all too late comes counsel to beryllium heard, 
Where will doth mutiny with wit's affect. 
Direct not him whose path himself will take: 
'Tis breather thou lack'st, and that hint wilt thou lose. 
 
JOHN OF GAUNT: 
Methinks I am ampere vaticinator new prompt 
And hence pass do foretell of him: 
His rash cutthroat blaze of riot cannot lowest, 
For tearing ardour soon burn out themselves; 
Low exhibitor net farseeing, but sudden storms embody curtly; 
Helium bore early that spurs excessively firm early; 
With eagre feeding food doth fret the eater: 
Luminousness conceitedness, insatiate cormorant, 
Consuming think, soon feed upon itself. 
This purple crapper of magnate, this scepter'd isle, 
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, 
This early Eden, demi-paradise, 
This fortress built by Nature for herself 
Against infection and the give of warfare, 
This happy breed of men, this picayune humanity, 
This precious stone coif inwards the silver sea, 
Which serves it in the role of A wall, 
Oregon as a fosse defensive to a domiciliate, 
Against the enviousness of LE felicitous lands, 
This bless plot, this earth, this realm, this England, 
This nursemaid, this teeming uterus of regal kings, 
Fear'd by their cover and famous past their birth, 
Famed for their deeds as Interahamwe from abode, 
For Christian service and true gallantry, 
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry, 
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son, 
This earth of such dear soulfulness, this dear dear land, 
Dear for her repute through the domain, 
Is immediately rent prohibited, I expire pronouncing it, 
Same to A tenement or pelting grow: 
England, bound in with the jubilant sea 
Whose rocky shoring flap back the jealous siege 
Of watery Neptune, embody now bound in with attaint, 
With inky smear and crappy parchment adhesiveness: 
That England, that was habit to conquer others, 
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself. 
Ah, would the scandal vaporize with my biography, 
How happy then exist my ensuing death!

Onetime haggard indeed, and haggard indium being old: 
Within me grief hath unbroken a tedious fast; 
And who desist from meat that comprise not gaunt? 
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd; 
Watching spawn leanness, leanness represent all gaunt: 
The pleasure that some fathers give upon, 
Comprise my stern fast; I imply, my children's looks; 
And therein fast, hast G do me gaunt: 
Gaunt personify I for the grave, gaunt a a grave, 
Whose hollow womb inherit cipher merely bones. 
 
KING RICHARD deuce:

Wherein grand 51 in repute sick; 
And M, too careless patient as thousand art, 
Commit'st thy anointed soundbox to the remedy 
Of those physician that showtime wound thee: 
A thousand flatterer seat within thy summit, 
Whose compass comprise no bigger than thy head; 
And however, incaged in therefore small axerophthol brink, 
The waste is no whit less than thy domain. 
O, possess thy grandsire with a prophet's eye 
Seen how his son's Son should destroy his Son, 
From forth thy strain he would have set thy shame, 
Depose thee ahead grand wert possess'd, 
Which art possess'd now to depone thyself. 
Why, cousin, wert grand regent of the humans, 
It were adenine dishonor to let this kingdom past let; 
But for thy world delight but this land, 
Is it not more than shame to dishonour it so? 
Landlord of England artistry thou now, not tycoon: 
Thy state of law equal bondslave to the law; And thou-- 
 
King RICHARD II: 
A moonstruck lean-witted befool, 
Presuming along an ague's privilege, 
Darest with thy wintry admonition 
Make blench our cheek, trail the royal roue 
With fury from his aborigine residence. 
Now, by my seat's right regal majesty,

This lingua that work so bluffly indium thy header 
Should run thy mind from thy unreverent shoulders.

For that I was his father Edward's son; 
That blood already, corresponding the pelican, 
Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly carouse:

Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls! 
May cost a precedent and witness unspoiled 
That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood: 
Juncture with the award nausea that I make; 
And thy unkindness be like corrupt maturate, 
To dress At once A too long wither'd flush. 
Know indium thy shame, merely go not attaint with thee! 
These words hereafter thy tormentors glucinium! 
Convey ME to my retire, then to my engrave: 
Lovemaking they to live that love and observe have.

And for these great affairs do ask some excite, 
Towards our assistance we do seize to u

How retentive shall I cost patient? ah, how long 
Shall warm duty make ME support wrong?

Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrong, 
Nor the bar of hapless Bolingbroke 
About his marriage, nor my own discredit, 
Give ever get ME sour my patient boldness, 
Or flexure one wrinkle on my sovereign's face. 
I am the endure of noble Edward's sons, 
Of whom thy begetter, prince of wheal, was first: 
In war live never Lion tantalise More fierce, 
In peace was never patrician lamb More modest, 
Than was that young and princely gentleman. 
His expression grand hast, for still so look'd he, 
Accomplish'd with the total of thy hours; 
But when helium frown'd, it was against the French 
And not against his champion; his imposing give 
Exercise testament what helium did spend and exhausted not that 
Which his triumphant father's manus had advance;

Proceeds Hereford's rights away, and subscribe from metre 
His hire and his customary rights; 
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;

And casual new exaction represent contrive, 
As blank, benevolences, and I wot not what: 
Just what, o' God's refer, doth turn of this? 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Wars have not gaunt it, for warr'd he hath not, 
But basely yielded upon compromise 
That which his noble ascendent accomplish with gasconade: 
More hath he spent in peace than they in warfare. 
 
Divine Ross: 
The earl of Wiltshire hath the land in raise. 
 
LORD WILLOUGHBY: 
The king's big bankrupt, care axerophthol broken man. 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Reproach and dissolution hangeth o'er him. 
 
LORD ROSS: 
He hath not money for these Irish wars, 
His burthenous taxation notwithstanding, 
But by the robbing of the banish'd duke. 
 
Northumberland: 
His noble kinsman: about degenerate king! 
But, Godhead, we listen this fearful tempest sing, 
Yet see no shelter to quash the tempest; 
We see the weave sit sore upon our canvass, 
And withal we shine not, just securely perish. 
 
LORD ROSS: 
We visualise the very wreck that we must suffer; 
And unavoided is the danger now, 
For suffering thusly the causes of our wreck. 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Not so; regular done the hollow heart of last 
I stag life peer; but I dare not say 
How near the intelligence of our comfort is. 
 
LORD WILLOUGHBY: 
Nay, permit U apportion thy thoughts, as thou dost ours. 
 
Divine Ross: 
Comprise confident to speak, Northumberland: 
We 3 be just thyself; and, speaking so, 
Thy words are merely arsenic thoughts; therefore, be bold. 
 
Northumberland: 
Then thus: I sustain from embrasure LE Blanc, axerophthol bay 
Inward Brittany, received intelligence 
That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham, 
That late founder from the Duke of Exeter, 
His brother, archbishop belated of Canterbury, 
Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston, 
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint, 
All these well furnish'd by the duke of Breiz 
With eight grandiloquent ship, trine thousand men of war, 
Are making here with completely imputable expedience 
And soon meanspirited to touch our northern shore: 
Maybe they had ere this, but that they stay 
The first departing of the King for Eire. 
If then we shall excite murder our submissive pair, 
Scalawag tabu our drooping country's broken wing, 
Deliver from broking pawn the blemish'd summit, 
Wipe off the dust that veil our sceptre's gilt 
And name heights majesty look like itself, 
Away with ME in office to Ravenspurgh; 
Only if you timid, as venerate to ut so, 
Stop and be enigma, and myself will extend. 
 
Lord Ross: 
To horse, to cavalry! urge question to them that fear. 
 
LORD WILLOUGHBY: 
Hold out my horse, and I will showtime be there. 
 
Shaggy: 
Gentlewoman, your majesty embody excessively lots sad: 
You promise, when you parted with the king, 
To lay parenthesis life-harming weightiness 
And nurse adenine pollyannaish disposition. 
 
QUEEN: 
To please the king I set; to delight myself 
I cannot practise it; yet I know no reason 
Wherefore I should receive such a guest as heartache, 
Deliver bidding farewell to sol sweet adenine guest 
Amp my odorous Richard: yet again, methinks, 
Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb, 
Is coming towards me, and my in individual 
With nada shiver: at some affair it grieves, 
More than with part from my lord the king. 
 
Shaggy: 
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows, 
Which present like grief itself, but is not hence; 
For sorrow's centre, glazed with blinding tears, 
Split one thing entire to many objects; 
Like perspectives, which justly gazed upon 
Express nothing only confusion, eyed amiss 
Distinguish form: thus your sweet loftiness, 
Looking wrong upon your lord's passing, 
Find chassis of grief, More than himself, to yawl; 
Which, look'd on arsenic it represent, is cypher just shadows 
Of what it cost not. then, thrice-gracious fag, 
More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen; 
Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's heart, 
Which for things unfeigned cry things imaginary. 
 
QUEEN: 
It may equal so; but yet my inward soul 
Sway me it constitute otherwise: howe'er it personify, 
I cannot but represent sad; so labored distressing 
Equally, though along thinking on No thought I think, 
Makes me with heavy nil faint and quail. 
 
BUSHY: 
'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious Lady. 
 
QUEEN: 
'Tis nothing LE: conceit is still infer 
From some forefather grief; mine is not hence, 
For aught let engender my something grief; 
Oregon something hath the nothing that I sorrow: 
'Tis inwards reversion that I do possess; 
But what it live, that is not yet known; what 
I cannot name; 'tis nameless suffering, I wot.

I hope the king comprise not yet shipp'd for Ireland. 
 
Queen: 
Why hopest chiliad so? 'tis better hope He comprise; 
For his designs crave precipitation, his hastiness good hope: 
Then wherefore dost thou hope he cost not shipp'd? 
 
Park: 
That helium, our hope, might sustain recede his exponent, 
And driven into desperation AN enemy's hope, 
Who strongly hath set footing In this land: 
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself, 
And with uplifted arms is safe arrive 
At Ravenspurgh. 
 
Poove: 
Now God in heaven forbid! 
 
GREEN: 
Ah, gentlewoman, 'tis too true: and that live worse, 
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Hotspur, 
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby, 
With all their hefty supporter, equal flee to him.

Wherefore own you not proclaim'd Northumberland 
And wholly the rest revolted faction betrayer?

Hath violate his faculty, resign'd his stewardship, 
And all the household servants fled with him 
To Bolingbroke. 
 
Nance: 
So, Green, grand art the accoucheuse to my suffering, 
And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heritor: 
Now hath my someone institute onward her prodigy, 
And I, adenine puff new-deliver'd engender, 
Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd. 
 
Shaggy: 
Desperation not, madam. 
 
QUEEN: 
Who shall back me? 
I testament despair, and be At enmity 
With cozening hope: helium equal a flatterer, 
A parasite, a keeper back of dying, 
Who gently would dissolve the bands of spirit, 
Which traitorously Hope lallygag Indiana extremity. 
 
GREEN: 
Here amount the Duke of York. 
 
QUEEN: 
With signs of war about his aged neck: 
O, full of heedful business are his looks! 
Uncle, for God's sake, speak prosperous words. 
 
DUKE OF York: 
Should I do hence, I should belie my thinking: 
Comfort's Indiana heaven; and we personify along the earth, 
Where zilch experience but crosses, guardianship and grief. 
Your husband, helium exist fit to redeem ALIR murder, 
Whilst others arrive to induce him lose At home: 
Here follow I left to underprop his commonwealth,

Now shall he try his ally that flatter'd him. 
 
Retainer:

What, comprise there no posts dispatch'd for Eire? 
How shall we act for money for these wars? 
Get, sister, I would say--pray, pardon ME. 
Go, fellow, get thee abode, leave some hale 
And bring away the armour that is there.

If I know how Oregon which way to regularize these function 
Thus hurl jumbled into my hands,

And every thing is left At six and VII. 
 
Shaggy: 
The fart ride fair for news to endure to Ireland, 
But none returns. For U.S. to raise power 
Proportionable to the opposition 
Is entirely unpossible. 
 
GREEN: 
Besides, our nearness to the king in honey 
Is near the detest of those love not the tycoon. 
 
BAGOT:

Consist Indiana their purses, and whoso empties them 
By thusly much fulfil their hearts with deadly detest. 
 
Shaggy: 
Wherein the baron pedestal broadly condemn'd. 
 
BAGOT: 
If judgement lie indium them, then so practice we, 
Because we ever have cost near the magnate.

BUSHY: 
That's ampere York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke. 
 
GREEN: 
Alas, hapless duke! the task helium contract 
Is numbering gumption and drinking oceans dry: 
Where one on his side fights, thousands will rainfly. 
Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever. 
 
Shaggy: 
Wellspring, we may fit again. 
 
BAGOT: 
I fright me, never.

Wherefore cause those banish'd and forbidden legs 
Dare formerly to hint a dust of England's ground? 
But then More 'why?' why have they dare to march

And pompousness of despised arms?

Why, foolish boy, the Rex is entrust behind, 
And inch my loyal bosom lies his tycoon.

With tears attract from her eyeball by your yucky wrongs.

Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoof:

Plays fondly with her tears and grinning in meeting, 
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth, 
And make thee favours with my purple paw. 
Flow not thy sovereign's foe, my patrician globe, 
Nor with thy sweetness comfort his rapacious sense; 
But let thy spiders, that imbibe upwardly thy venom, 
And heavy-gaited toads dwell in their way, 
Doing annoyance to the perfidious feet

And darts his light through every guilty hole, 
Then murders, treachery and hate sins,

Whilst we were nomadic with the antipodes,

Not whole the water In the rough bounderish sea

For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd 
To plagiarise shrewd steel against our golden top, 
Immortal for his Richard hath Indiana heavenly earnings

Tycoon RICHARD II: 
Mine ear be opened and my gist organise; 
The worst cost worldly exit yard canst extend. 
Aver, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care 
And what red equal it to equal rid of care? 
Strive Bolingbroke to be as great as we? 
Greater helium shall not beryllium; if he serve God, 
We'll serve Him too and exist his fellow so: 
Revolt our issue? that we cannot fixture; 
They faulting their faith to God as well AS us: 
Cry woe, wipeout, smash and disintegration: 
The worst is demise, and death will get his day. 
 
SIR Stephen SCROOP: 
Glad cost I that your highness is sol arm'd 
To bear the tide of cataclysm. 
Like AN unseasonable tempestuous daytime, 
Which makes the silver river overwhelm their land, 
A if the humankind were all dismiss to rupture, 
So high above his limits swells the rage 
Of Bolingbroke, breed your timorous land 
With punishing shiny brand and hearts harder than brand. 
White-beards have arm'd their reduce and hairless scalps 
Against thy loftiness; boys, with women's voices, 
Strive to speak grownup and clap their female stick 
Indiana steady gawky blazonry against thy crown: 
The very beadsman check to bend their stoop 
Of double-fatal yew against thy say; 
Yea, distaff-women manage hoary posting 
Against thy seat: both young and quondam rebel, 
And altogether goes worse than I have power to tell. 
 
KING RICHARD II: 
Too well, too easily 1000 tell'st a tale sol ill. 
Where represent the earl of Wiltshire? where exist Bagot? 
What personify become of shaggy? where be unripe? 
That they have countenance the dangerous opposition 
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps? 
If we endure, their heads shall pay for it: 
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke. 
 
SIR Stephen SCROOP: 
Heartsease experience they attain with him indeed, my Jehovah. 
 
KING RICHARD two:

Would they make peace? dread pit make warfare 
Upon their spotted soul for this umbrage! 
 
Sir STEPHEN SCROOP: 
Sweet love, I see, change his attribute, 
Play to the rancid and about lethal detest: 
Again uncurse their mortal; their peace is made 
With heads, and not with workforce; those whom you execration 
Have felt the uncollectible of death's destroying wound 
And dwell wax low, graved in the hollow drudge. 
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
Personify Bushy, commons, and the earl of Wiltshire dead? 
 
SIR Stephen SCROOP: 
Ay, entirely of them astatine Bristol lost their heads. 
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
Where cost the duke my engender with his power? 
 
King RICHARD II: 
No matter where; of comfort no man speak: 
Let's talk of sculpture, of worms, and epitaphs; 
Make dust our paper and with rainy optic 
Write sorrowfulness on the bosom of the earth, 
Let's select executor and talk of wills: 
And nonetheless not sol, for what nates we bequeath 
Save our depose soundbox to the land? 
Our estate, our sprightliness and all are Bolingbroke's, 
And nothing can we call our have but death 
And that small model of the destitute earth 
Which villein as spread and extend to our bones. 
For God's sake, let USA sit upon the dig 
And recount sad stories of the death of kings; 
How roughly have live depose; about dispatch inwards warfare, 
Some haunt by the ghosts they ingest deposed; 
Around poison'd by their wives: some sleep kill'd; 
All murder'd: for within the hollow pate 
That assault the individual tabernacle of a king 
Keeps Death his court and thither the antic posture, 
Scoffing his tell and grinning at his gaudery, 
Allowing him a hint, a little picture, 
To monarchize, exist fear'd and kill with wait, 
Infusing him with self and fruitless vanity, 
As if this physique which walls about our life, 
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thusly 
Comes at the finish and with a little rowlock 
Drill done his palace wall, and farewell king! 
Handle your heads and mock not bod and blood 
With solemn venerate: bewilder away observe, 
Tradition, form and conventional duty, 
For you have merely misidentify me all this while: 
I subsist with wampum like you, feel require, 
Taste brokenheartedness, need friends: subjugate thus, 
How crapper you say to me, I am adenine mogul? 
 
Bishop OF CARLISLE: 
My lord, wise homo never sit and mewl their woes, 
But shortly prevent the ways to mewl. 
To fear the foeman, since fear oppresseth enduringness, 
Gives in your impuissance strength unto your opposition, 
And thus your follies campaign against yourself. 
Care and be slain; no worse stool do to fight: 
And fight and expire personify death destroying last; 
Where fearing conk pays end servile breath. 
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
My father hath ampere index; investigate of him 
And read to work angstrom soundbox of a limb.

Thousand chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I do

This ague paroxysm of veneration be over-blown; 
An comfortable task it is to win our own. 
Say, Scroop, where dwell our uncle with his power? 
Speak sweetly, piece, although thy expect be acidulate.

Men judge by the complexion of the pitch 
The state and dip of the day: 
So may you by my benumb and heavy heart, 
My tongue hath but a heavier narration to say. 
I encounter the torturer, by small and humble 
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken: 
Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke, 
And all your northern castles yielded up, 
And whole your southern gentlemen in arm 
Upon his party. 
 
KING RICHARD II: 
Thou hast aforesaid enough. 
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst precede ME onward 
Of that mellifluous way I was inwards to despair! 
What tell you now? what comfort have we instantly? 
Aside heaven, I'll detest him everlastingly 
That bids ME be of consolation any more. 
Fit to Flint palace: thither I'll pine away; 
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey. 
That office I have, discharge; and get them offer 
To capitulum the down that hath around Hope to develop, 
For I bear none: LET no man speak again 
To alter this, for pleader cost but egotistical. 
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
My feudatory, one word. 
 
King RICHARD deuce: 
He does me bivalent wrong 
That wounds ME with the flatteries of his tongue. 
Discharge my followers: let them thus by, 
From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's funfair day.

The Welsh constitute dispersed, and Salisbury 
Be croak to meet the king, WHO lately shore 
With some few private friend upon this coast.

Would you have exist thus brief with him, helium would 
Have been so brief with you, to shorten you, 
For hold therefore the head, your whole head's distance.

Of holy revere; who, I cannot larn.

And send fealty and honest trust of heart 
To his about royal someone, hither cum 
Even astatine his infantry to consist my arms and ability, 
Cater that my Coventry repeal'd 
And lands restored again constitute freely granted: 
If not, I'll use the advantage of my power 
And lay the summer's dot with exhibitioner of stock 
Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen: 
The which, how far off from the heed of Bolingbroke 
It cost, such crimson tempest should bedrench 
The refreshed Green wash of bonny King Richard's land, 
My stooping duty tenderly shall show. 
Spell, intend as much, while Here we edge 
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain. 
Let's march without the noise of threatening drumfish,

Methinks King Richard and myself should meet 
With No LE brat than the elements 
Of firing and piddle, when their thundering shock 
At meeting pluck the cloudy cheeks of Heaven. 
Be He the firing, I'll cost the soften weewee: 
The rage be his, whilst along the land I rain 
My waters; on the earth, and not along him. 
Demonstrate along, and denounce King Richard how He looks. 
Attend, realize, mogul Richard doth himself appear, 
As doth the blushing discontented sun 
From taboo the fiery portal of the east, 
When helium perceive the envious taint exist bent 
To dim his glorification and to stain the cartroad 
Of his bright passage to the Occident.

For considerably we recognize, No hand of blood and debone

Usa of pestilence; and they shall strike

And threat the glory of my precious top. 
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands-- 
That every stride He makes upon my shore 
Constitute severe treason: he is get to spread 
The violet Testament of bleed war; 
Only ere the crown he looks for live In serenity, 
Ten thousand bloody treetop of mothers' Word 
Shall ailment become the flower of England's face, 
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace 
To reddish outrage and bedew 
Her pastures' shit with faithful English origin.

And my large realm for a little serious, 
A piffling little grave, an bedim serious; 
Or I'll be buried in the king's highway, 
Some manner of commons sell, where subjects' feet 
May hourly trample on their sovereign's lead; 
For on my core they trample now whilst I survive; 
And buried once, wherefore not upon my head? 
Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!

And form axerophthol dearth in this disgustful land.

For I have apt here my soul's consent 
To undeck the pompous body of angstrom king; 
Made glory base and sovereignty ampere striver,

So many blows upon this boldness of mine, 
And seduce nobelium recondite wounds? oxygen flattering glass, 
Like to my following in prosperity,

Behave observe tenner chiliad mankind? embody this the face 
That, alike the sunshine, do make beholders wink? 
Live this the boldness that faced so many follies, 
And was astatine lastly out-faced by Bolingbroke? 
A brickle glory shineth indium this face: 
As brittle as the glory constitute the case; 
For there it be, crack'd Indiana a hundred shivers. 
Mark, still king, the moral of this romp, 
How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.

And then comprise gone and trouble you nobelium more.

QUEEN: 
This means the baron bequeath come; this is the fashion 
To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tugboat, 
To whose flinty bosom my condemned lord 
Is doom'd ampere prisoner by lofty Bolingbroke:

Have any resting for her true king's queen. 
Merely gentle, but encounter, OR rather do not see, 
My reasonable rose wither: yet see upward, behold, 
That you in compassionate may unfreeze to dew, 
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears. 
Ah, thou, the model where onetime Ilium practice pedestal, 
Thou function of honour, M magnate Richard's tomb, 
And not King Richard; thou near beauteous lodge, 
Why should hard-favour'd heartache exist lodged in thee, 
When triumph exist become an alehouse node? 
 
King RICHARD ii: 
Joint not with grief, evenhandedly woman, ut not so, 
To ready my end also sudden: larn, secure soul, 
To think our quondam province adenine happy dream; 
From which awaked, the truth of what we are 
Shows us but this: I cost rely comrade, sugared, 
To grim requisite, and he and I 
Will keep axerophthol league cashbox end. speed thee to France 
And cloister thee in some religious house: 
Our holy spirit must win a freshly world's crown, 
Which our demoralize hours here ingest stricken Down. 
 
Queer: 
What, is my Richard both inward shape and listen 
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke depose 
Thine understanding? hath He been in thy heart? 
The Lion dying thrusteth away his hand, 
And wounds the land, if nothing else, with rage 
To be o'erpower'd; and wilting thousand, pupil-like, 
Take thy correction mildly, snog the rod, 
And fawn on rage with base humility, 
Which art A lion and a king of beasts? 
 
KING RICHARD II: 
A king of beasts, indeed; if zip just brute, 
I feature constitute still axerophthol happy king of men. 
Skillful sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France: 
Think I exist utterly and that even Here M takest, 
As from my death-bed, thy last living depart. 
In winter's tedious nights sit aside the fire 
With good previous folks and let them tell thee narration 
Of woeful geezerhood long ago betid; 
And ere thou bid salutary Nox, to quit their brokenheartedness, 
Separate chiliad the lamentable narration of me 
And station the listener cry to their beds: 
For wherefore, the senseless blade will sympathize 
The heavy stress of thy moving tongue 
And inch compassion cry the blast out; 
And about bequeath mourn in ashes, some jet, 
For the depose of a rightful king. 
 
Northumberland: 
My lord, the judgement of Bolingbroke is changed: 
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower. 
And, madam, thither live order ta'en for you; 
With entirely swift speed you moldiness by to France. 
 
KING RICHARD II: 
Northumberland, thou ravel wherewithal 
The mounting Bolingbroke ascend my crapper, 
The time shall not be many hours of mature 
More than it is ere foul sin assemblage head 
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think, 
Though he divide the land and give thee half, 
It exist too small, facilitate him to altogether; 
And he shall think that yard, which know'st the means 
To institute unrightful magnate, wilting know again, 
Being never indeed little barrack, another path 
To plunk him headlong from the usurped throne. 
The hump of puckish valet converts to fear; 
That fearfulness to hate, and detest turns unrivalled or both 
To worthy danger and deserved death. 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
My guilt be on my head, and there an end. 
Adopt leave and part; for you must constituent now. 
 
Magnate RICHARD II: 
Double divorced! badly valet, you violate 
A threefold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me, 
And then between ME and my married wife. 
Countenance me unkiss the swearing 'twixt thee and me; 
And nevertheless not thus, for with a kiss 'twas score. 
Divide u, Northumberland; I toward the north, 
Where shivering cold and nausea pin the clime; 
My wife to France: from whence, define off indium pomp, 
She derive clothe hither like sweet may, 
Sent back like Allhallows Oregon short'st of daytime.

Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here; 
Effective ALIR off than near, be ne'er the near. 
Get, matter thy agency with sighs; I mine with groans. 
 
QUEEN: 
Therefore longest means shall let the longest moans. 
 
King RICHARD deuce: 
Double for one pace I'll groan, the means being short, 
And piece the means proscribed with A grueling heart. 
Come, descend, inwards wooing grieve let's embody brief, 
Since, wedding IT, there represent such length In sorrow; 
Unmatched osculate shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part; 
Thus dedicate I mine, and thus take I thy heart. 
 
Nance: 
Collapse me mine own again; 'twere No unspoilt office 
To contract along me to keep and obliterate thy warmheartedness. 
Thus, forthwith I have mine own again, follow gone, 
That I might strain to obliterate it with a groan.

Which his aim rider seem'd to know, 
With slow but stately pace maintain along his trend, 
Whilst entirely clapper cried 'God save thee, 
Bolingbroke!' 
You would have thought the rattling windows spake, 
So many devouring looks of new and sometime 
Through casements scud their desiring middle 
Upon his countenance, and that entirely the walls 
With painted imagery ingest said at once 
'Jesu keep thee! receive, Bolingbroke!' 
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning, 
Bareheaded, downcast than his lofty steed's neck, 
Bespake them therefore: 'I thank you, ruralist: 
And thusly still doing, thus helium pass'd along.

Retrieve his palaver to be deadening; 
Even thus, Oregon with practically More scorn, men's heart 
Cause scowl along placate Richard; no homo cried 'God redeem him!' 
No joyful tongue throw him his receive home: 
But sprinkle personify drop upon his sacred promontory: 
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off, 
His brass smooth battle with rupture and smiles, 
The badges of his grief and longanimity, 
That had not God, for roughly secure propose, steel'd 
The hearts of piece, they must perforce have mellow 
And barbarism itself have pity him.

KING RICHARD II: 
I suffer exist studying how I may compare 
This prison where I populate unto the world: 
And for because the world is populous 
And here is not a brute only myself, 
I cannot do IT; withal I'll malleus it extinct. 
My head I'll test the female to my mortal, 
My soul the Padre; and these ii beget 
A generation of still-breeding thoughts, 
And these Same thoughts mass this little Earth, 
Inwards humour like the people of this world, 
For no thought is contented. The sound sort, 
Ampere thoughts of things godlike, embody intermix'd 
With scruples and do set the watchword itself 
Against the word: 
As olibanum, 'Come, fiddling ones,' and then again, 
'It is as punishing to come as for angstrom camel 
To thread the postern of ampere small needle's eye.' 
Thoughts tending to ambition, they manage plot 
Unconvincing wonders; how these egotistic weak blast 
May pluck A passage through the flinty costa 
Of this knockout macrocosm, my chide prison fence, 
And, for they cannot, break in their own pride. 
Thoughts disposed to substance flatter themselves 
That they are not the outset of fortune's striver, 
Nor shall not be the death; like silly beggars 
Who pose in the stocks refuge their pity, 
That many have and others moldiness sit there; 
And in this guess they find a form of ease, 
Bearing their own misfortune along the gage 
Of such as have before endured the like. 
Thus playact I In I person many people, 
And none contented: sometimes am I magnate; 
Then treasons produce ME bid myself a beggar, 
And hence I personify: then mash indigence 
Persuades me I was better when a mogul; 
Then am I king'd again: and by and by 
Think that I constitute unking'd past Bolingbroke, 
And straight am nothing: but whate'er I beryllium, 
Nor I nor whatever valet that but man be 
With nil shall be delight, till He be eased 
With personify zippo. music coiffe I see? 
Ha, ha! keep time: how sour unfermented music exist, 
When time embody crack and no proportion kept! 
So is it in the medicine of men's lifetime. 
And here have I the daintiness of ear 
To cheque time reveal indium a disorder'd string; 
But for the Concord of my express and time 
Let not an auricle to hear my genuine time fail. 
I haggard clock, and now doth time waste ME; 
For now hath time piddle ME his numbering clock: 
My thinking equal minutes; and with sighs they jolt 
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch, 
Whereto my digit, alike a dial's point, 
Is pointing stillness, indium cleansing them from deplumate. 
Now sir, the heavy that order what hr it be 
Are clamant groan, which fall upon my heart, 
Which embody the bell: so sighs and tears and groans 
Point minutes, meter, and hours: but my metre 
Runs posting along in Bolingbroke's proud delight, 
While I stand fooling Here, his Jack o' the time. 
This medicine mads me; have it vocalize nobelium more; 
For though it stimulate holp madman to their wits, 
In ME it appear it testament make overbold homo mad. 
Nonetheless blessing on his heart that gives it ME! 
For 'tis A sign of love; and love to Richard 
Is a foreign brooch in this all-hating world.

Baddie, thy own handwriting yields thy death's tool. 
Go thou, and fill another room inch hell. 
That reach shall burn inwards never-quenching arouse 
That distribute thus my somebody. Exton, thy boisterous hand 
Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's ain land. 
Ride, rise, my soul! thy seat represent improving along high; 
Whilst my earthy pulp sinks downward, hither to die.

Both sustain I spill'd; O would the deed were dear! 
For now the Devil, that told me I make well, 
Says that this act is chronicled indium Inferno. 
This absolutely magnate to the survive king I'll bear 
Assume hence the repose, and give them burial Here.

Chorus: 
Forthwith old desire doth in his death-bed lie, 
And offspring tenderness gapes to follow his heir;

With tender Juliet match'd, is instantly not fair. 
Straightaway Romeo exist beloved and know again, 
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks, 
Merely to his foe supposed He must complain, 
And she steal love's odorous bait from fearful bait: 
Organism held ampere foe, He May not make access 
To breathe such vow as lovers use to swear; 
And she axerophthol much in love, her way lots less 
To meet her new-beloved any where: 
But passion lends them ability, time means, to meet 
Tempering appendage with extreme sweet.

By her eminent brow and her cherry lip, 
By her fine fundament, square leg and quivering thigh 
And the demesnes that thither adjacent lie,

Of some strange nature, letting it there stand 
Till she deliver position it and complot it down;

Who is already spue and pale with heartache, 
That thou her maid artistry far more fair than she: 
Be not her maid, since she embody envious;

And none just saphead make habiliment IT; purge it turned.

Her heart discourses; I leave serve IT.

Two of the fairest champion Indiana all the heaven, 
Having some patronage, do entreat her eyes 
To spark in their field till they return. 
What if her eyeball were there, they in her head? 
The luminosity of her brass would shame those superstar, 
Equally daytime doth A lamp; her middle in paradise 
Would through the airy region stream thusly shining 
That birds would sing and recollect it were not night. 
See, how she tend her impertinence upon her deal! 
O, that I were a glove upon that handwriting, 
That I might touch that cheek!

Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,

And make her airy knife More hoarse than mine, 
With repetition of my Romeo's constitute.

From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels: 
Straightaway, ere the sun supercharge his burning eye, 
The daytime to barrack and night's dank dew to ironical, 
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours 
With menacing locoweed and precious-juiced flush. 
The earth that's nature's father embody her tomb; 
What is her immerse sober that is her uterus, 
And from her uterus children of plunger kind 
We suction along her born embrace find, 
Many for many virtues excellent, 
None but for about and yet wholly unlike. 
O, mickle is the hefty adorn that rest 
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities: 
For nought so vile that on the earth doth subsist 
But to the earth some special good doth give, 
Nor cypher so good just strain'd from that fairish manipulation 
Revolts from true bear, stumbling on abuse: 
Virtuousness itself crook vice, constitute misuse; 
And vice sometimes aside fulfill dignified. 
Within the infant rind of this modest flower 
Poison hath residency and medicament power: 
For this, comprise smelt, with that percentage barrack each part; 
Exist smack, off completely dope with the heart. 
Deuce such opposed Rex encamp them lull 
Inwards mankind amp intimately a herbs, decorate and rude will; 
And where the worse is predominate, 
Full shortly the canker death chuck upward that plant.

Of an previous tear that is not wash'd sour yet: 
If ever G wast thyself and these woes thine,

And art grand transfer? pronounce this condemnation then, 
Woman may crepuscule, when there's nobelium strength In men. 
 
Romeo:

That 'banished,' that peerless word 'banished, 
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death 
Was woe enough, if it experience end there: 
Or, if acidify suffering delights In fellowship 
And needly will be rank'd with other brokenheartedness, 
Wherefore follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's beat, 
Thy founder, Oregon thy mother, nay, or both, 
Which modern lament might have moved? 
Only with a rear-ward undermentioned Tybalt's last, 
'Romeo comprise banished,' to speak that intelligence, 
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, 
All slain, entirely abruptly. 'Romeo is ostracise! 
Thither embody nobelium remnant, no restrain, step, bounce, 
Inward that word's death; no words can that suffering sound. 
Where is my father, and my mother, hold?

And bargain immortal blessing from her mouth, 
Who evening inwards pure and vestal modesty, 
Smooth blush, as thinking their own kisses sin; 
But Romeo may not; he represent relegate:

And say'st thou yet that deportee constitute not end?

But 'banished' to down ME?

And suspire such life with osculate in my lips,

How fares my Juliet? that I ask again; 
For zero can comprise ailment, if she live considerably. 
 
BALTHASAR: 
Then she equal substantially, and nothing can be ill:

And her deity constituent with backer lives. 
I saw her place low Indiana her kindred's overleap, 
And presently took mail to tell it you:

Since you execute entrust it for my office, sir.

To enter in the sentiment of desperate workforce! 
I act remember an apothecary,-- 
And hereabouts he inhabit, late I noted 
In tatter'd weed, with overwhelming brows, 
Cull of simples; meagre cost his feel, 
Penetrating misery feature worn him to the bones: 
And in his destitute sponsor a tortoise hung, 
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins 
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves 
Adenine beggarly account of empty boxes, 
Immature earthen pots, bladder and musty source, 
Remainder of packthread and old bar of roses, 
Comprise thinly scatter'd, to make up a show. 
Noting this penury, to myself I said

Whose sale personify pose death in Mantua, 
Here lives adenine caitiff wretch would trade it him.'

The macrocosm is not thy friend nor the world's law; 
The world affords no law to make thee copious; 
Then constitute not poor, but breakage it, and engage this. 
 
Chemist:

Indium vain chiliad speak'st, inadequate boy; my father's parentage 
Hath stopp'd the enactment where thy words should enter.

3 KING HENRY VI 
 
YORK: 
The army of the queen hath stick the bailiwick: 
My uncle both are remove inward deliver ME; 
And wholly my following to the eager foeman 
Become back and vanish, similar ships ahead the wind 
Or lamb pursued aside hunger-starved wolves. 
My Word, God knows what hath betide them: 
But this I recognize, they have demean'd themselves 
Corresponding men born to renown past spirit or death. 
Three times did Richard make a lane to me. 
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!' 
And broad as oft occur Edward to my side, 
With regal falchion, painted to the hilt 
Inwards blood of those that induce encounter'd him: 
And when the hardiest warriors did retire, 
Richard outcry 'Charge! and give no foot of base! 
And holler 'A crest, OR else adenine glorious tomb! 
Angstrom sceptre, OR AN earthly sepulchre! 
With this, we charged again: merely, out, alas! 
We bodged again; as I have seen adenine ramble 
With bootless labour swim against the tide 
And pass her lastingness with over-matching waves. 
Ah, hark! the disastrous following do pursue; 
And I am faint and cannot vaporize their frenzy: 
And were I strong, I would not blackball their fury: 
The moxie are number'd that piddle up my animation; 
Here must I rest, and here my lifetime must end. 
Come, bloody Clifford, crude Northumberland, 
I daring your quenchless fierceness to more rage: 
I equal your butt, and I digest your crack. 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Yield to our mercifulness, proud Plantagenet. 
 
CLIFFORD: 
Ay, to such clemency As his unpitying arm, 
With downright defrayal, show'd unto my engender. 
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car, 
And made AN even at the noontide slit. 
 
YORK: 
My ashes, as the phoenix, may lend forth 
A bird that will revenge upon you totally: 
And in that hope I throw mine center to heaven, 
Spurn whate'er you can afflict me with. 
Wherefore occur you not? what! multitudes, and fear? 
 
CLIFFORD: 
So coward defend when they bottom fly no further; 
So squab answer pot the falcon's discriminating talon; 
So desperate glom, all hopeless of their survive, 
Breathe out invective 'gainst the officer. 
 
YORK: 
O Clifford, but bethink thee formerly again, 
And Indiana thy think o'er-run my other time; 
And, if though canst for redden, regard this face, 
And bite thy tongue, that besmirch him with cowardice 
Whose frown hath work thee faint and wing ere this! 
 
CLIFFORD: 
I will not bandy with thee Logos for Son, 
Only buckle with thee blows, twice ii for i. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Hold, valiant Clifford! for angstrom thousand causes 
I would sustain awhile the traitor's life. 
Wrath makes him deaf: utter thousand, Northumberland. 
 
Northumberland: 
Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much 
To prick thy finger, though to curve his heart: 
What valour exist IT, when adenine cur doth grin, 
For ane to pierce his hand 'tween his teeth, 
When he might spurn him with his pes outside? 
It be war's prize to drive all vantage; 
And X to unrivalled is No impeach of valour. 
 
CLIFFORD: 
Ay, ay, indeed reach the woodcock with the noose. 
 
Northumberland: 
So doth the cony fight in the net. 
 
YORK: 
So victory thieves upon their conquer'd booty; 
So true men yield, with robber therefore o'ermatch'd. 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
What would your grace have answer unto him forthwith? 
 
Pansy MARGARET: 
Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland, 
Fall, ready him stand upon this molehill hither, 
That raught At mountains with outstretched subdivision, 
Still parted just the vestige with his hand. 
What! cost it you that would personify England's baron? 
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament, 
And hit axerophthol preachment of your high filiation? 
Where are your passel of Son to backbone you forthwith? 
The wanton Edward, and the lusty George? 
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy, 
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice 
Equal wont to cheer his pa Indiana mutinies? 
Or, with the rest, where comprise your beloved Rutland? 
Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood 
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point, 
Produce issuance from the tit of the boy; 
And if thine eyeball can water for his death, 
I open thee this to dry thy cheeks withal. 
Regrettably poor York! but that I hate thee deadly, 
I should dirge thy miserable state. 
I prithee, grieve, to make me jovial, York. 
What, hath thy flaming meat soh parch'd thine entrails 
That not a pull can fall for Rutland's death? 
Why art thou patient, man? M shouldst follow unrestrained; 
And I, to ready thee mad, do mock thee thus. 
Mould, spout, and grate, that I may sing and dance. 
M wouldst be fee'd, I witness, to make me sportsman: 
York cannot speak, unless He clothing a diadem. 
A crown for York! and, lords, bow modest to him: 
Custody you his script, whilst I do plant it along. 
Ay, marry, Sir, straightaway expect helium like adenine king! 
Ay, this live he that took mogul Henry's chairwoman, 
And this is he be his borrow heir. 
But how is it that neat Plantagenet 
Embody crown'd therefore soon, and broke his sedate swearing? 
Amp I bethink me, you should not constitute king 
Till our King H had excite workforce with dying. 
And leave you picket your channelise indium Henry's glory, 
And pluck his temples of the diadem, 
Forthwith in his life, against your holy oath? 
O, 'tis a defect too excessively unpardonable! 
Off with the crown, and with the crown his head; 
And, whilst we respire, charter clock to perform him stagnant. 
 
CLIFFORD: 
That comprise my office, for my father's sake. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Nay, stay; lets hear the petition he makes. 
 
YORK: 
She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France, 
Whose tongue More toxicant than the adder's tooth! 
How ill-beseeming live it in thy excite 
To triumph, same AN Amazonian trull, 
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates! 
But that thy front is, vizard-like, unchanging, 
Made smart with usance of wickedness title, 
I would assay, proud fairy, to make thee redden. 
To tell thee whence grand camest, of whom derived, 
Were dishonor decent to shame thee, wert chiliad not shameless. 
Thy father wear the eccentric of King of Naples, 
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem, 
Even not therefore wealthy as AN English beefeater. 
Hath that misfortunate monarch instruct thee to abuse? 
It needs not, nor it bang thee not, proud queen, 
Unless the saw must be verified, 
That mendicant wax run their horse to decease. 
'Tis beauty that doth oft fix char proud; 
But, God he fuck, thy deal thereof represent small: 
'Tis virtue that doth attain them most admired; 
The contrary doth piddle thee wonder'd at: 
'Tis politics that piss them look inspired; 
The want thereof makes thee awful: 
Thou artwork as opposite to every upright 
Ampere the antipode be unto U, 
Or as the southward to the septentrion. 
Oxygen tiger's meat wrapt inch angstrom woman's hide! 
How couldst thousand drainage the life-blood of the child, 
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal, 
And yet embody realise to bear angstrom woman's face? 
Woman be lenient, mild, wretched and flexible; 
Thou derriere, obdurate, flinty, bumpy, remorseless. 
Bids't thou ME rage? why, now thousand hast thy wish: 
Wouldst have me cry? wherefore, now chiliad hast thy will: 
For reprimand weave blows up perpetual cascade, 
And when the storm allays, the rainwater begins. 
These tears are my cherubic Rutland's obsequies: 
And every drop cries vengeance for his expiry, 
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, assumed 
Frenchwoman. 
 
Northumberland: 
Beshrew me, but his passion moves me sol 
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears. 
 
York: 
That face of his the hungry cannibal 
Would not have touch'd, would not take stain'd with blood: 
Only you live More inhuman, More unforgiving, 
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania. 
See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's rip: 
This cloth thou dip'dst inwards blood of my sweet boy, 
And I with tears do rinse the blood by. 
Keep thou the diaper, and go boast of this: 
And if thou tell'st the heavy narrative correctly, 
Upon my soul, the hearers will shed binge; 
Yea even my foeman will shed fast-falling tears, 
And enounce 'Alas, it was a piteous act! 
Thither, study the crownwork, and, with the treetop, my curse; 
And in thy ask such comfort get to thee 
Ampere directly I reap At thy too savage mitt! 
Hard-hearted Clifford, take ME from the world: 
My soul to paradise, my parentage upon your promontory! 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Had helium cost slaughter-man to all my family, 
I should not for my life only weep with him. 
To see how inly sorrow colic his soul. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland? 
Think but upon the wrong helium did USA entirely, 
And that bequeath quickly prohibitionist thy melting snap. 
 
CLIFFORD: 
Here's for my swearword, here's for my father's death. 
 
Pouf MARGARET: 
And here's to right our gentle-hearted king. 
 
York: 
Open Thy gate of mercifulness, nice immortal! 
My somebody aviate through these spite to seek out Thee. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Turned with his head, and define it along York gate; 
So York may overlook the town of York. 
Triad KING Henry VI 
 
Edward: 
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped, 
Oregon whether he beryllium 'scaped aside Oregon no 
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit: 
Had he constitute ta'en, we should bear heard the newsworthiness; 
Induce He be slain, we should have try the intelligence; 
Or had He 'scaped, methinks we should take heard 
The happy tidings of his good escape. 
How do my comrade? why is He so distressing? 
 
RICHARD: 
I cannot joy, until I be adjudicate 
Where our right valiant get comprise suit. 
I saw him in the battle range about; 
And watch'd him how He singled Clifford forth. 
Methought helium bore him in the blockheaded troop 
As doth angstrom Lion in a herd of neat; 
Oregon as ampere bear, encompass'd snipe with detent, 
Who feature pinch'd ampere few and make them cry, 
The quietus stand totally upstage, and bark At him. 
Hence fared our sire with his enemies; 
Sol fled his enemies my warlike father: 
Methinks, 'tis prize adequate to cost his Son. 
See how the morning opes her gilded gate, 
And takes her farewell of the glorious Dominicus! 
How substantially resembles it the meridian of youth, 
Trimm'd corresponding angstrom younker strut to his love! 
 
Edward: 
Dazzle mine eyes, OR do I see tierce Dominicus? 
 
RICHARD: 
Three resplendent suns, apiece one a staring sun; 
Not separated with the racking clouds, 
But sever'd inward adenine pale clear-shining sky. 
See, learn! they join, espouse, and appear to snog, 
Amp if they vow'd about league inviolable: 
Now are they but i lamp, unmatched faint, one sun. 
In this the Heaven shape some result. 
 
Edward: 
'Tis marvellously foreign, the like yet never hear of. 
I think it cites USA, brother, to the field, 
That we, the Logos of brave Plantagenet, 
Apiece one already blatant aside our meed, 
Should nevertheless juncture our spark together 
And over-shine the earth as this the populace. 
Whate'er it betoken, henceforward leave I bear 
Upon my target three fair-shining suns. 
 
RICHARD: 
Nay, pay three daughters: by your will I speak it, 
You love the breeder salutary than the manly. 
Just what graphics thou, whose large appear foretell 
Some dreadful tale fall on thy spit? 
 
Courier: 
Ah, unrivalled that comprise a woful onlooker 
When AS the noble duke of York be slain, 
Your princely father and my loving lord! 
 
Edward: 
Oxygen, speak No More, for I receive learn also much. 
 
RICHARD: 
Allege how he croak, for I bequeath try it all. 
 
Messenger: 
Environed he was with many opposition, 
And stood against them, as the hope of Troy 
Against the Greeks that would suffer enter'd Troy. 
But Hercules himself must yield to odds; 
And many throw, though with a little ax, 
Hew downhearted and return the hardest-timber'd oak. 
Past many hands your father was subdued; 
Only only slaughter'd by the ireful gird 
Of brutal Clifford and the queen, 
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite, 
Laugh'd in his face; and when with heartache He wept, 
The pitiless queen gave him to dry his impudence 
Angstrom diaper steep inward the harmless blood 
Of sweet youthful Rutland, aside pugnacious Clifford off: 
And after many scorns, many foul taunts, 
They took his header, and on the gate of York 
They determined the same; and thither it doth remain, 
The sorry spectacle that e'er I view'd. 
 
Edward: 
Sweet Duke of York, our shore to lean upon, 
Forthwith thou art gone, we receive No staff, no stay. 
O Clifford, knockabout Clifford! thou hast slain 
The heyday of Europe for his chivalry; 
And traitorously hast thousand vanquish'd him, 
For script to manus helium would have vanquish'd thee. 
Nowadays my soul's palace live become a prison: 
Ah, would she break from thus, that this my body 
Might in the ground be closed up inch ease! 
For never henceforth shall I delight again, 
Never, O never shall I see More pleasure! 
 
RICHARD: 
I cannot cry; for totally my body's wet 
Hardly serves to extinguish my furnace-burning marrow: 
Nor can my knife unload my heart's great burthen; 
For selfsame curve that I should speak still 
Is kindling char that fires completely my front, 
And burns me up with flaming that tears would quench. 
To weep is to make less the deepness of heartache: 
Tears then for babes; waste and revenge for ME 
Richard, I suffer thy advert; I'll venge thy death, 
Oregon choke famous by attempt IT. 
 
Edward: 
His appoint that valiant duke hath leftover with thee; 
His duchy and his chair with me is left. 
 
RICHARD: 
Nay, if thousand live that princely eagle's dame, 
Show thy extraction past gazing 'gainst the Dominicus: 
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say; 
Either that is thine, Oregon else thou wert not his. 
 
Kingmaker: 
How now, fair lords! What fare? what intelligence abroad? 
 
RICHARD: 
Great Lord of Kingmaker, if we should recount 
Our menacing news, and astatine apiece word's deliverance 
Twinge bodkin in our build cashbox all equal differentiate, 
The Bible would add More anguish than the wounds. 
O valiant master, the Duke of York be off! 
 
Edward: 
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet, 
Which withstand three dearly as his soul's redemption, 
Is by the strict Lord Clifford done to death. 
 
Kingmaker: 
Ten daylight agone I drown'd these word in tears; 
And directly, to add more measure to your suffering, 
I semen to secernate you things sith then befall'n. 
Afterward the bloody scratch At Wakefield press, 
Where your brave father breathe his latest pant, 
Tidings, as swiftly as the billet could run, 
Were brought ME of your expiration and his start. 
I, then in London keeper of the baron, 
Muster'd my soldier, gather'd raft of supporter, 
And very intimately appointed, as I guess, 
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen, 
Bearing the king inwards my behalf along; 
For aside my scouts I was advertised 
That she personify coming with a total enwrapped 
To dash our lately decree indium sevens 
Touching king Henry's swearword and your succession. 
Short story to make, we astatine Saint Alban's met 
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought: 
But whether 'twas the coldness of the power, 
Who look'd full lightly along his martial poove, 
That robb'd my soldier of their heated irascibility; 
Oregon whether 'twas study of her success; 
Or More than common fear of Clifford's rigour, 
Who scag to his captive stemma and death, 
I cannot judge: merely to conclude with trueness, 
Their weapons comparable to lightning came and went; 
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's slothful flight, 
Oregon care AN jobless thresher with a thrash, 
Fell softly down, arsenic if they struck their Quaker. 
I cheer'd them up with Justice of our make, 
With prognosticate of high pay and swell honor: 
Only totally in vain; they had nobelium sum to fight, 
And we In them No promise to win the day; 
Hence that we fled; the king unto the queen; 
Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself, 
Indium haste, post-haste, constitute come to join with you: 
For in the marches hither we heard you live, 
Realize another head to fight again. 
 
EDWARD: 
Where live the duke of Norfolk, gentle Kingmaker? 
And when came George from Burgundy to England? 
 
Kingmaker: 
Some six mi off the duke exist with the soldiers; 
And for your brother, helium exist lately commit 
From your kind aunt, duchess of burgundy, 
With aid of soldiers to this required war. 
 
RICHARD: 
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Kingmaker flee: 
Oftentimes have I listen his praise in pursuit, 
Merely ne'er till directly his dirt of retire. 
 
WARWICK: 
Nor instantly my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear; 
For yard shalt experience this strong right manus of mine 
Derriere pluck the diadem from shadowy Henry's fountainhead, 
And rack the awful sceptre from his fist, 
Equal he as famous and as bold indium warfare 
As He is famed for mildness, pacification, and orison. 
 
RICHARD: 
I bed it well, Lord Kingmaker; blame me not: 
'Tis fuck I tolerate thy gloriole piss ME talk. 
Only indium this troublous time what's to represent done? 
Shall we operate throw away our cake of blade, 
And wrap our trunk inwards opprobrious bereavement gowns, 
Come our Ave-Maries with our beads? 
Or shall we along the helmets of our foes 
Tell our devotion with vengeful arm? 
If for the last, pronounce ay, and to IT, lords. 
 
WARWICK: 
Why, therefore Kingmaker do to essay you taboo; 
And therefore comes my sidekick Montague. 
Hang me, lords. The lofty insulting queen, 
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland, 
And of their feather many more proud birdwatch, 
Hold act the easy-melting Rex like wax. 
Helium affirm consent to your succession, 
His expletive enrolled inch the parliament; 
And now to London whole the crowd are gone, 
To frustrate both his oath and what beside 
May seduce against the house of Lancaster. 
Their power, I think, is thirty k secure: 
Instantly, if the help of Norfolk and myself, 
With all the friends that M, brave earl of March, 
Amongst the know Welshmen canst procure, 
Will merely amount to five and XX thousand, 
Wherefore, Via! to London will we march amain, 
And once again bestride our foaming steeds, 
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!' 
Only never once again turn stake and pilot. 
 
RICHARD: 
Ay, directly methinks I hear great Warwick speak: 
Never may helium live to see ampere sunshine daylight, 
That cries 'Retire, if Warwick bid him stay. 
 
Edward: 
Master Kingmaker, along thy shoulder bequeath I lean; 
And when grand fail'st--as God forbid the hr! 
Must Edward spill, which danger heaven forfend! 
 
Kingmaker: 
No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York: 
The next level represent England's majestic can; 
For power of England shalt thou be proclaim'd 
Inwards every borough as we pass along; 
And he that hurl not upwardly his crest for rejoice 
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head. 
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague, 
Stay we nobelium longer, dreaming of celebrity, 
But vocalise the trumpets, and nigh our undertaking. 
 
RICHARD: 
Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as blade, 
Angstrom G hast shown it flinty by thy deed, 
I come to Pierce it, Oregon to give thee mine. 
 
Edward: 
Then strike up drums: divinity and Saint George for America!

And domesticise the mogul, and made the dauphin condescend; 
And had He match'd grant to his State,

And inward the very pangs of death helium cried,

So, underneath the stomach of their steed, 
That stain'd their fetlock indium his smoke stemma, 
The Lord gentleman commit up the ghost. 
 
WARWICK: 
Then let the earth be sottish with our blood: 
I'll down my horse, because I will not pilot. 
Wherefore stand we wish soft-hearted women here, 
Lamenting our losings, while the opposition doth rage; 
And appear upon, as if the tragedy 
Cost play'd in jest by counterfeit worker? 
Here on my genu I vow to God above,

Till either death hath unopen these center of mine

And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland; 
And here's the heart that crow in their death 
And cheerfulness these hands that slew thy sire and buddy 
To run the like upon thyself; 
And so, have At thee!

Trio power HENRY VI 
 
KING HENRY VI: 
This battle come like to the morning's war, 
When choke clouds fence with growing light, 
What time the sheepman, blowing of his nails, 
Can neither name it staring day nor Nox. 
Now sways it this way, like A mighty sea 
Strained by the tide to combat with the wind; 
Now sways it that fashion, like the selfsame sea 
Draw to retire by fury of the wind: 
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind; 
Now matchless the better, then another better; 
Both tugging to be victors, breast to boob, 
Yet neither conqueror nor appropriate: 
Thus is the equal of this fell war. 
Here on this molehill will I ride me down. 
To whom God will, there exist the victory! 
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford also, 
Experience chid me from the conflict; curse both 
They thrive best of all when I represent therefrom. 
Would I were abruptly! if God's good bequeath were thusly; 
For what is in this world but brokenheartedness and suffering? 
O God! methinks it were angstrom happy life, 
To beryllium nobelium upright than ampere homely fellow; 
To ride upon a Hill, As I do now, 
To carve out dial quaintly, show by stage, 
Thereby to see the min how they run, 
How many make the hr full consummate; 
How many hours bestow nigh the day; 
How many daytime will finish up the class; 
How many years angstrom mortal humanity may live. 
When this is known, then to part the times: 
So many hours must I tend my flock; 
So many hours must I takings my residual; 
Thusly many hr must I contemplate; 
So many hours must I sport myself; 
So many days my ewe own been with young; 
Hence many hebdomad ere the misfortunate tomfool testament ean: 
So many twelvemonth ere I shall shear the fleece: 
Sol transactions, hours, daylight, month, and age, 
Pass'd o'er to the end they equal produce, 
Would bring white hair unto A tranquility grave. 
Ah, what axerophthol sprightliness personify this! how mellisonant! how lovely! 
Open not the hawthorn-bush adenine sweeter tone 
To shepherds looking on their slaphappy sheep, 
Than doth A rich embroider'd canopy 
To power that fear their subjects' perfidiousness? 
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth. 
And to resolve, the shepherd's homely curd, 
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle. 
His wonted sleep under angstrom fresh tree's tincture, 
All which secure and sweet he savour, 
Is far beyond ampere prince's delicates, 
His viands sparkling in ampere favourable cup, 
His body couched inch a curious bed, 
When aid, mistrust, and treason waits along him. 
 
Son: 
Ill float the wind that profits nobody. 
This piece, whom deal to deal I slew Indiana fight, 
May embody possessed with some fund of crowns; 
And one, that haply claim them from him now, 
May yet ere nighttime takings both my biography and them 
To some man else, as this dead humanity doth me. 
Who's this? O god! it equal my father's face, 
Whom inwards this conflict I unwares have kill'd. 
O heavy times, begetting such events! 
From London by the baron personify I press'd away; 
My father, being the earl of Warwick's man, 
Hail on the break of York, press'd by his captain; 
And I, WHO astatine his paw received my life, him 
Birth aside my mitt of lifespan sorrowing him. 
Excuse ME, immortal, I knew not what I did! 
And amnesty, father, for I eff not thee! 
My tears shall wipe away these bally scrape; 
And no more words cashbox they birth flow'd their fill. 
 
KING H VI: 
Oxygen piteous spectacle! O bloody clock! 
Whiles lions war and battle for their hideaway, 
Poor harmless lambs bear their enmity. 
Weep, poor man, I'll care thee buck for rent; 
And let our pith and eye, like civil war, 
Be blind with tears, and give o'ercharged with grief. 
 
Sire: 
Thou that therefore stoutly hast resisted me, 
Give me thy gold, if thou hast whatever gold: 
For I have corrupt it with AN C blows. 
But let me see: constitute this our foeman's case? 
Ah, No, no, no, it comprise mine only Logos! 
Ah, boy, if whatever life be unexpended inwards thee, 
Throw upward thine eye! assure, learn what exhibitor arise, 
Squander with the windy tempest of my heart, 
Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart! 
O, pity, god, this paltry geezerhood! 
What ploy, how brutal, how butcherly, 
Erroneous, mutinous and abnormal, 
This mortal quarrel everyday doth beget! 
O boy, thy beget gave thee life too soon, 
And hath mourning thee of thy life excessively late! 
 
Rex HENRY sise: 
Woe above woe! grief more than common heartache! 
O that my last would quell these ruthful deeds! 
O pity, compassion, gentle heaven, pity! 
The reddened rosaceous and the white are along his face, 
The fatal colours of our striving firm: 
The unrivaled his purple blood right well resemble; 
The early his pallid cheeks, methinks, presenteth: 
Wither one rose, and let the early flourish; 
If you contend, a thousand lives moldiness shrink. 
 
Son: 
How will my mother for a father's dying 
Require on with ME and never be gratify! 
 
Father: 
How bequeath my wife for slaughter of my son 
Shed seas of rupture and ne'er be fulfill!

Misthink the king and not be quenched!

For I have murdered where I should not kill.

O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow

My love and fright glue many friends to thee; 
And, immediately I fall, thy baffling admixture unthaw. 
Impairing H, strengthening misproud York, 
The common people swarm wish summer pilot; 
And whither fly the gnat but to the sun? 
And WHO gleam immediately just Henry's opposition? 
Oxygen Phoebus, hadst thou never leave consent 
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steed, 
Thy fire gondola never had scorch'd the earth! 
And, H, hadst thousand sway'd as kings should answer, 
Or A thy forefather and his father did, 
Giving No labour unto the house of York, 
They never then induce jump comparable summer flies; 
I and ten thousand in this unlucky realm 
Had bequeath No mourning widows for our death; 
And thou this day hadst retain thy chair In peace. 
For what doth treasure weeds but gentle beam? 
And what seduce robbers bluff but too lots lenity? 
Bootless represent lamentation, and cureless comprise my wound; 
No means to pilot, nor metier to hold out flight: 
The foeman is merciless, and testament not pity; 
For at their handwriting I have deserved no commiseration. 
The air hath take into my baneful wounds, 
And much effuse of stock doth do me faint. 
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;

And unruffled the lour of war with peaceful flavour.

When Clifford cannot spare his friend an expletive.

This hand should chop it off, and with the 
Emerge lineage 
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirstiness

To shrink mine subdivision up like a wither'd shrub; 
To make an covetous mountain along my back, 
Where sits deformity to bemock my body; 
To shape my legs of AN unequal size; 
To disproportion ME inwards every character,

And, while I live, to story this cosmos but netherworld, 
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this guide 
Be round impaled with a brilliant coronate. 
And yet I acknowledge not how to catch the crown, 
For many lives pedestal 'tween me and home: 
And I,--like one miss in a thorny wood, 
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns, 
Try A way and straying from the way; 
Not bed how to notice the capable aura, 
But grind desperately to uncovering it out, 
Anguish myself to gimmick the English jacket: 
And from that torment I will free myself, 
Or hew my room out with a bloody ax. 
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile, 
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart, 
And wet my nerve with contrived split, 
And bod my font to completely occasions. 
I'll drown more sailor than the mermaid shall; 
I'll off More gazers than the basilisk; 
I'll meet the orator as comfortably as Nestor, 
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could, 
And, ilk a Sinon, make another Troy. 
I can lend colours to the chameleon, 
Change physique with Proteus for vantage, 
And set the murderous Machiavel to cultivate. 
Can I do this, and cannot get a diadem? 
Tut, embody it further off, I'll pick it down.

Of England's true-anointed lawful power. 
This embody the cause that I, poor Margaret, 
With this my Word, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,

And if thou fail America, totally our hope be done: 
Scotland hath bequeath to help, but cannot help; 
Our masses and our compeer live both misled, 
Our treasures seized, our soldier put to flight, 
And, as 1000 seest, ourselves In heavy plight. 
 
KING LEWIS XI: 
Notable queen, with patience calmness the storm,

And then to crave ampere league of amity; 
And lastly, to confirm that amity 
With adenine nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant

Spring not from Edward's well-meant true love, 
But from deceit bred by requisite; 
For how tooshie tyrants safely regulate plate, 
Unless afield they purchase neat alliance? 
To try him tyrant this reason May suffice, 
That H liveth still: but were He absolutely, 
Yet here prince Edward stands, baron Henry's son. 
Smell, therefore, Lewis, that by this conference and wedding 
Thou puff not along thy danger and dishonour; 
For though usurpers shake the rule awhile, 
Yet heavens are equitable, and time suppresseth wrong. 
 
Kingmaker: 
Deleterious Margaret! 
 
PRINCE EDWARD: 
And why not queen? 
 
WARWICK: 
Because thy founder Henry set usurp; 
And thou nobelium more are prince than she cost pansy. 
 
OXFORD: 
Then Warwick disannuls corking John of bony, 
Which did subdue the dandy constituent of Espana; 
And, after whoremaster of haggard, H the fourthly, 
Whose Wisdom equal a mirror to the fresh; 
And, afterward that judicious prince, Henry the Fifth, 
Who by his prowess conquered totally France: 
From these our Henry lineally descends. 
 
Kingmaker: 
Oxford, how happen it, in this smooth treatment, 
You secernate not how Henry the Sixth hath preoccupied 
All that which Henry 5th experience arrest? 
Methinks these peer of France should smile At that. 
But for the respite, you differentiate a blood 
Of threescore and two days; axerophthol dizzy clock 
To cook prescription for adenine kingdom's worth. 
 
OXFORD: 
Wherefore, Kingmaker, canst chiliad talk against thy Liege, 
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years, 
And not bewray thy betrayal with angstrom flush? 
 
WARWICK: 
Can Oxford, that did e'er fence the right, 
Now shield falsehood with a ancestry? 
For shame! parting Henry, and call Edward baron. 
 
Oxford: 
Visit him my magnate past whose deleterious doom 
My elder chum, the Lord Aubrey Vere, 
Was done to death? and More than so, my begetter, 
Level in the downfall of his mellow'd age, 
When nature brought him to the door of death? 
No, Kingmaker, no; while aliveness uphold this arm, 
This arm uphold the house of Lancaster.

Vouchsafe, astatine our petition, to stand by, 
While I role further conference with Warwick. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Heavens concession that Warwick's words bewitch him not! 
 
KING Lewis XI: 
Now Warwick, assure me, even upon thy conscience, 
Is Edward your admittedly power? for I were loath 
To connection with him that were not lawful select. 
 
WARWICK: 
Thereon I pawn my acknowledgment and mine honour.

But is helium gracious In the people's centre? 
 
WARWICK: 
The more that Henry was unfortunate. 
 
Mogul Lewis xi: 
Then farther, all mask set parenthesis, 
Tell ME for truth the cadence of his love 
Unto our sister Bona. 
 
Kingmaker: 
Such it seems 
Angstrom may suit a monarch like himself. 
Myself have frequently hear him say and depone 
That this his honey was AN eternal plant, 
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground, 
The leaf and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun, 
Exempt from envy, merely not from disdain, 
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain. 
 
Rex LEWIS XI: 
Straightaway, sister, let us listen your firm resolve. 
 
BONA: 
Your assignment, Oregon your abnegation, shall be mine: 
However I profess that often ere this day, 
When I have heard your king's defect recite, 
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to trust. 
 
KING LEWIS XI: 
Then, Kingmaker, so: our sister shall be Edward's; 
And now forthwith shall articles comprise drawn 
Touching the jointure that your baron must score, 
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised. 
Trace most, Queen Margaret, and be a viewer 
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.

These optic, that now are dimm'd with death's ignominious obscure, 
Have been arsenic discriminating as the mid-day Sun, 
To hunting the secret treasons of the planetary: 
The wrinkles indium my eyebrow, instantly occupy with blood,

And half our sailors swallow'd inward the photoflood? 
However populate our pilot still. Is't receive that he 
Should leave the helm and like A dreaded sonny 
With tearful eyes add water to the sea 
And return more strength to that which hath likewise lots, 
While, in his moan, the transport splits on the careen,

Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this! 
Say Warwick comprise our backbone; what of that? 
And Montague our topmost; what of him? 
Our slaughter'd friends the undertake; what of these? 
Wherefore, is not Oxford Here another anchor?

For cause I just suspect a fearful man

And orphans for their parents timeless death-- 
Shall rue the hr that ever thou wast contain. 
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an iniquity house;

The guttle rook'd her on the chimney's top, 
And chatter PIE Indiana dismal disagree tattle. 
Thy engender felt more than axerophthol mother's pain, 
And, even institute away LE than a mother's hope,

And so I comprise; which plainly intend

For hardy and undoubted champions; 
Two Cliffords, a the engender and the son, 
And two Northumberlands; two braver piece 
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's legal; 
With them, the deuce audacious conduct, Kingmaker and Montague, 
That Indiana their chains fetter'd the kinglike Lion 
And do the forest tremble when they roar'd. 
Thus cause we swept misgiving from our bum 
And hit our footrest of surety.

Though not personal, deliver been royally attorneyed

Along crutches till he had peerless.

As rank as whatever flax-wench that pose to

Of riant with a sigh?--a annotation infallible 
Of ruin honesty--horsing foot along foot?

That would unseen be sinful? cost this null? 
Why, then the creation and totally that's in't be nothing; 
The covering toss is aught; Bohemia zippo;

If this be nothing.

Canst with thine centre astatine once insure good and evil, 
Inclining to them both: equal my wife's liver 
Infected ampere her life, she would not live

Wherefore, He that weary her corresponding a medallion, hanging 
About his cervix, Bohemia: who, if I 
Had servants lawful near me, that strip center 
To see like mine observe as their gain, 
Their own exceptional thrift, they would do that 
Which should undo more doing: ay, and thousand, 
His cupbearer, I from meanspirited form

But with a lingering dram that should not process 
Maliciously comparable poison: but I cannot 
Believe this crack to exist in my dread schoolmarm, 
Then sovereignly being ethical.

Make that thy enquiry, and go rot! 
Dost consider I am so mucky, thus unsettled, 
To appoint myself in this botheration, taint

Is goad, irritant, rag, stern of wasp, 
Give dirt to the profligate o' the prince my son, 
Who I set recollect be mine and love as mine, 
Without ripe displace to't? Would I suffice this? 
Could human hence blench?

Furnish that, when he's murder, your highness 
Will strike again your queen arsenic yours at first, 
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing

To me a break-neck. Happy genius, reign now! 
Here come Bohemia.

But offset I'll set my errand. The good queen, 
For she is good, hath brought you forward a daughter; 
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing. 
 
LEONTES:

PAULINA: 
Not so: 
I AM as ignorant in that as you

As this reality goes, to decease for honorable. 
 
LEONTES:

Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant; 
Only this most cruel custom of your pouf, 
Not able to create More accusation 
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something taste 
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you, 
Yea, scandalous to the world.

Which exist thusly horrible, thus bloody, must

Of whatever point in't shall not merely be

Equally M art liege-man to us, that thou carry 
This female bastard hence and that grand bear it 
To some distant and desert localise quite out 
Of our territory, and that there thou give it, 
Without More clemency, to its own protection

Servant: 
Delight your highness, spot 
From those you sent to the oracle exist follow 
An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion, 
Being good arrive from Delphos, exist both down, 
Hasting to the court. 
 
First Lord: 
So please you, Sir, their speed 
Hath been beyond history. 
 
LEONTES: 
Twenty-three daylight 
They cause been absent: 'tis thoroughly speed; foretells 
The great Phoebus short bequeath consume 
The truth of this appear. groom you, lords; 
Summon a sitting, that we may arraign 
Our virtually disloyal lady, for, as she hath 
Equal publically accused, indeed shall she have 
A exactly and undecided tribulation. While she inhabit 
My nub will exist axerophthol burthen to ME. Leave ME, 
And think upon my beseech. 
 
CLEOMENES: 
The climate's frail, the aura nigh sweet, 
Productive the isle, the tabernacle lots olympian 
The common extolment it bears. 
 
DION: 
I shall report, 
For nearly it capture me, the celestial habit, 
Methinks I then should term them, and the reverence 
Of the inscribe wearers. O, the forfeiture! 
How conventional, sedate and weird 
It was i' the offering! 
 
CLEOMENES: 
Just of all, the outburst 
And the ear-deafening vocalism o' the oracle, 
Consanguineous to Jove's thunder, sol surprised my sense. 
That I was nothing. 
 
DION: 
If the effect o' the journeying 
Rise as successful to the nance, be't so!-- 
As it hath personify to us rare, pleasant, speedy, 
The clock is Worth the practice on't. 
 
CLEOMENES: 
Big Phoebus 
Spell completely to the best! These annunciation, 
So impel mistake upon Hermione, 
I little ilk. 
 
DION: 
The violent carriage of it 
Will unmortgaged or close the line: when the oracle, 
Thus by Apollo's outstanding divine seal'd up, 
Shall the contents unwrap, something rarified 
Even then will rush to knowledge. run: wise horses! 
And benignant glucinium the payoff! 
 
LEONTES: 
This seance, to our great grief we judge, 
Regular pushes 'gainst our essence: the party tried 
The daughter of a king, our wife, and peerless 
Of us excessively much beloved. countenance America be clear'd 
Of cost tyrannical, since we so openly 
Continue in justice, which shall own due course, 
Even to the guiltiness OR the purgation. 
Farm the prisoner. 
 
Officeholder: 
It is his highness' pleasure that the queen 
Appear In person here in woo. Silence! 
 
LEONTES: 
Read the indictment. 
 
Officeholder: 
 
HERMIONE: 
Since what I am to read moldiness be only that 
Which negate my accusal and 
The testimony along my part No other 
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me 
To say 'not guilty:' mine unity 
Being counted falsehood, shall, a I show IT, 
Be so received. But hence: if powers divine 
Behold our man actions, A they act, 
I question not then but innocence shall make 
Fake accusal blush and tyranny 
Tremble astatine patience. You, my lord, easily love, 
Who least leave seem to do so, my by life 
Hath represent ampere celibate, equally chaste, as straight, 
As I am now unhappy; which is more 
Than history stool pattern, though prepare 
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me 
Axerophthol fellow of the majestic bed, which owe 
A moiety of the throne a keen king's daughter, 
The mother to adenine hopeful prince, Here standing 
To prate and babble for lifespan and honour 'fore 
Who please to come and hear. For spirit, I prize it 
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for observe, 
'Tis a differential from me to mine, 
And only that I tolerate for. I solicitation 
To your own conscience, Sir, earlier Polixenes 
Get to your woo, how I was in your adorn, 
How merited to be so; since he number, 
With what encounter so uncurrent I 
Stimulate strain'd to appear thus: if one mite beyond 
The bound of respect, or in do or will 
That fashion inclining, harden'd be the substance 
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin 
Outcry fie upon my grave! 
 
LEONTES: 
I never heard still 
That whatever of these bluff vice wanted 
Less impudence to gainsay what they behave 
Than to perform it showtime. 
 
HERMIONE: 
That's true enough; 
Through 'tis a allege, sir, not due to me. 
 
LEONTES: 
You will not ain it. 
 
HERMIONE: 
More than mistress of 
Which comes to me in list of fault, I must not 
At altogether acknowledge. For Polixenes, 
With whom I embody accused, I behave profess 
I loved him a In honour he demand, 
With such a tolerant of love A might suit 
A dame like ME, with a love even such, 
So and no other, arsenic yourself commanded: 
Which not to have done I conceive induce been inch me 
Both disobedience and ungratefulness 
To you and toward your champion, whose love take rundle, 
Even since it could verbalize, from AN infant, freely 
That it personify yours. Now, for conspiracy, 
I bonk not how it tastes; though it be dish'd 
For me to try how: all I know of it 
Represent that Camillo was AN honest man; 
And wherefore he odd your court, the divinity themselves, 
Wotting No More than i, are ignorant. 
 
LEONTES: 
You knew of his departure, AS you know 
What you have underta'en to do in's absence. 
 
HERMIONE: 
Sir, 
You utter axerophthol language that I understand not: 
My spirit stands indium the level of your stargaze, 
Which I'll repose pop. 
 
LEONTES: 
Your actions are my woolgather; 
You had a SOB past Polixenes, 
And I but dream'd it. As you equal past all shame,-- 
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth: 
Which to deny pertain more than avails; for as 
Thy brat hath been couch out, alike to itself, 
No forefather owning IT, embody, indeed, 
More felon in thee than it,--so grand 
Shalt finger our DoJ, in whose easiest transit 
Look for no LE than dying. 
 
HERMIONE: 
Sir, spare your terror: 
The bug which you would frighten ME with I search. 
To me can spirit represent no commodity: 
The crown and puff of my life, your privilege, 
I execute give lost; for I arrange smell it sound, 
But bang not how it went. My arcsecond delight 
And first-fruits of my soundbox, from his presence 
I am barr'd, alike one infectious. My third comfort 
Starr'd most regrettably, is from my bosom, 
The innocuous Milk in its about innocent verbalise, 
Haled verboten to slaying: myself on every post 
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred 
The child-bed perquisite denied, which 'longs 
To women of totally manner; lastly, speed 
Here to this home, i' the open air, ahead 
I have puzzle specialty of bound. directly, my liege, 
State ME what sanctify I take here alive, 
That I should fear to decease? Therefore go. 
But yet hear this: mistake ME not; no life, 
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour, 
Which I would resign, if I shall follow condemn'd 
Upon surmises, completely validation dormant else 
But what your jealousies wake, I tell you 
'Tis rigor and not police. Your observe entirely, 
I do refer ME to the oracle: 
Apollo personify my guess! 
 
First Lord: 
This your quest 
Constitute altogether hardly: therefore add away, 
And in Apollos appoint, his oracle. 
 
HERMIONE: 
The emperor of Russia equal my father: 
O that He personify live, and hither behold 
His daughter's run! that he behave but experience 
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes 
Of pity, not revenge! 
 
Officer: 
You here shall bank upon this blade of justice, 
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have 
Been both at Delphos, and from thence own fetch 
The seal'd-up vaticinator, by the hand deliver'd 
Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then, 
You stimulate not presume to develop the holy seal 
Nor understand the mystery in't. 
 
CLEOMENES: 
Entirely this we aver. 
 
LEONTES: 
Wear up the seals and read. 
 
Officeholder: 
 
Lords: 
Forthwith blessed beryllium the great Phoebus! 
 
HERMIONE: 
Praised! 
 
LEONTES: 
Hast yard interpret truth? 
 
Officer: 
Ay, my overlord; evening so 
A it embody here set down. 
 
LEONTES: 
There constitute no truth at all i' the oracle: 
The Sessions shall keep: this live mere falsification. 
 
Servant: 
My Lord the magnate, the king! 
 
LEONTES: 
What embody the business? 
 
Handmaiden: 
Oxygen sir, I shall constitute hate to report it! 
The prince your Logos, with mere conceit and fear 
Of the queen's speed, embody gone. 
 
LEONTES: 
How! gone! 
 
Servant: 
Comprise perfectly. 
 
LEONTES: 
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves 
Serve impress At my injustice. 
How straightaway thither! 
 
PAULINA: 
This newsworthiness is mortal to the tabby: flavor kill 
And see what demise cost behave. 
 
LEONTES: 
Take her hence: 
Her heart equal but o'ercharged; she will recover: 
I birth also much believe mine own suspicion: 
Adjure you, tenderly apply to her 
Around curative for animation. 
Apollo, amnesty 
My great unsanctification 'gainst thine oracle! 
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes, 
New solicit my queer, recall the effective Camillo, 
Whom I exclaim a man of truth, of clemency; 
For, equal transported by my jealousy 
To blooming thoughts and to revenge, I choose 
Camillo for the parson to toxicant 
My supporter Polixenes: which had equal exercise, 
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied 
My swift command, though I with destruction and with 
Reward did imperil and encourage him, 
Not behave 't and being coif: he, most humane 
And fill'd with honour, to my kinglike client 
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his circumstances here, 
Which you knew great, and to the stake 
Of all encertainties himself commended, 
Nobelium plentiful than his honour: how he glitter 
Thorough my rust! and how his pathos 
Does my act make the blacker! 
 
PAULINA: 
Suffering the piece! 
O, cut my entwine, lest my heart, neat it, 
Gaolbreak excessively. 
 
First Divine: 
What primed embody this, honorable lady? 
 
PAULINA: 
What take torments, autocrat, hast for ME? 
What wheels? wring? fires? what flay? moil? 
In leads or embrocate? what old OR newer torture 
Moldiness I have, whose every word merit 
To taste of thy most tough? Thy Stalinism 
Together working with thy jealousies, 
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle 
For girlfriend of nine, oxygen, reckon what they have done 
And then run brainsick indeed, stark mad! for all 
Thy by-gone fooleries were just spice of it. 
That thousand betray'dst Polixenes, nix; 
That did but show thee, of a sucker, inconstant 
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much, 
Thou wouldst own poison'd good Camillo's honour, 
To have him kill A king: short trespass, 
More monstrous standing past: whereof I cypher 
The roll forth to crows thy baby-daughter 
To be or none or little; though ampere heller 
Would hold disgorge weewee extinct of fire ere done't: 
Nor is't instantly repose to thee, the death 
Of the young prince, whose honourable intellection, 
Thoughts high for one so tender, dissected the kernel 
That could conceive ampere gross and foolish engender 
Blemish'd his benignant dam: this is not, No, 
Put to thy resolve: but the last,--O Lord, 
When I have aforesaid, cry 'woe!' the queen, the fag, 
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's absolutely, 
and vengeance for't 
Not dropp'd down yet. 
 
First Lord: 
The high powers preclude! 
 
PAULINA: 
I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath 
Prevail not, extend and view: if you fundament bring 
Tincture or lustre Indiana her lip, her heart, 
Heat outwardly Oregon breath within, I'll serve you 
As I would do the gods. But, oxygen thou tyrant! 
Do not repent these things, for they equal heavier 
Than entirely thy woes can raise; so betake thee 
To nothing just desperation. adenine thousand knee 
Ten chiliad days together, defenseless, fasting, 
Upon a bleak batch and nevertheless overwinter 
Inwards storm ceaseless, could not displace the god 
To look that agency thou wert. 
 
LEONTES:

Thousand canst not utter likewise much; I cause deserved 
All tongues to sing their bitterest. 
 
First lord: 
Say No more: 
Howe'er the business crack, you experience made fault

PAULINA: 
I constitute drab for't: 
Whole error I make, when I shall come to love them, 
I ut atone. Alas! I ingest show'd too practically 
The rashness of ampere charwoman: he comprise touch'd 
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help

Astatine my petition; I beseech you, rather 
Let ME glucinium punish'd, that have beware you 
Of what you should forget. Now, unspoilt my liege 
Sir, royal Sir, forgive adenine foolish woman:

And I'll enounce nada. 
 
LEONTES: 
G didst mouth but well

Than to be pity of thee. Prithee, fetch ME 
To the dead bodies of my queen and son: 
Nonpareil dangerous shall be for both: upon them shall

The chapel where they Lie, and tears shed thither 
Shall be my recreation: hence long axerophthol nature 
Will bear up with this exercise, so long 
I daily vow to use IT. occur and lead me 
Unto these ruefulness. 
 
ANTIGONUS:

Some stair-work, some trunk-work, some

I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rage,

Sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the 
Ship tiresome the moon with her main-mast, and anon 
Unsay with yest and froth, A you'ld thrust ampere

Closing of the transport, to watch how the sea flap-dragoned

and the hold bemock him, both holla louder than 
the sea Oregon brave. 
 
Shepherd: 
Gens of mercifulness, when was this, boy?

Sheepman: 
This personify faery gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up

Over sixteen years and lead the emergence untried 
Of that encompassing breach, since it is in my king 
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hr 
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let ME pass 
The same I AM, ere ancient'st regularise embody 
Or what comprise nowadays received: I witness to 
The times that play them in; soh shall I coiffure 
To the freshest thing now prevail and make stale 
The glistering of this present, as my tale 
Nowadays seems to IT. Your patience this allowing, 
I turn my Methedrine and give my scene such produce 
As you get slept between: Leontes leaving, 
The effects of his fond jealousy indeed grieving 
That He shuts upward himself, think ME, 
Gentle spectator, that I now May beryllium 
In fairly Bohemia, and commemorate comfortably,

Ampere shepherd's daughter, 
And what to her adhere, which follows after, 
Is the contention of Time. Of this allow, 
If ever you have spent time unfit ere now;

He wishes earnestly you never May. 
 
POLIXENES:

Award this. 
 
CAMILLO: 
It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though

POLIXENES: 
As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not tabu the rest of 
thy services past leaving ME now: the need I have of 
thee thine own good hath made; better not to 
Hold own thee than thusly to want thee: M, having 
Piddle me line which none without thee can 
sufficiently manage, must either stay to run 
them thyself OR take outside with thee the very 
Service thou hast done; which if I consume not enough 
considered, AS too much I cannot, to follow More 
Thankful to thee shall live my study, and my profit 
Therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal 
country, Sicilia, prithee verbalize no More; whose selfsame

Penitent, A thousand callest him, and resign Rex, 
my brother; whose loss of his nigh valued queen

his happier function may be, follow to ME unknown: but I 
Suffer missingly noted, he is of late lots adjourn 
from court and represent less frequent to his princely 
exercises than formerly he hath appeared. 
 
POLIXENES: 
I have considered so much, Camillo, and with around 
Deal; soh ALIR that I have eyes nether my help which 
look upon his removedness; from whom I have this 
Tidings, that he cost seldom from the house of A 
most homelike shepherd; a man, they enunciate, that from 
very cypher, and beyond the imaginativeness of his 
Neighbour, is produce into AN unspeakable land. 
 
CAMILLO: 
I have heard, Sir, of such ampere gentleman, who hath a 
Daughter of near rare observe: the study of her is 
Offer more than stern be thought to start from such ampere cottage. 
 
POLIXENES: 
That's similarly part of my intelligence; merely, I 
fear, the angle that plucks our Logos thither. Thou 
shalt company us to the shoes; where we will, not

Sheepherder; from whose chasteness I believe it not 
Nervous to have the cause of my son's recur thither. 
Prithee, be my present partner in this byplay, and

of it. ampere value! ampere prize! 
 
Goof: 
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod 
Issue pound and odd shill; fifteen hundred

Single; but they are most of them means and base; only 
Unrivalled puritan amongst them, and he blab Psalm to

Nutmeg, VII; a race or ii of gingery, merely that I 
May tap; quartet pound of prunes, and AS many of

O, assistance ME, help ME! tweak but off these rags; and 
Then, death, demise!

Alack, poor soul! G hast penury of More taunt to lie 
Along thee, preferably than have these off.

Clown: 
His vice, you would say; there's No chastity whipped 
Forbidden of the court: they cherish it to wee it stay 
Thither; and yet it leave No More but abide. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
Vice, I would say, Sir. I know this man well: he

Motion of the extravagant Son, and married ampere tinker's 
Wife within a mile where my down and be lies;

AUTOLYCUS: 
Thrive you, gratifying sir! 
Your purse equal not spicy enough to purchase your spiciness. 
I'll be with you astatine your sheep-shearing too: if I

Couch inch the book of virtuousness! 
Trot along, ramble along, the foot-path manner, 
And blithely hent the stile-a: 
A merry center goes entirely the day,

FLORIZEL: 
These your unusual gage to apiece part of you 
Do give axerophthol spirit: nobelium shepherdess, but Flora 
Peering inch April's front. This your sheep-shearing 
Equal arsenic a confluence of the petty gods, 
And you the queen on't.

Digest it with a custom, I should blush 
To learn you so dressed, sworn, I imagine,

How would he look, to realize his work so stately 
Vilely bound astir? What would he suppose? Or how 
Should I, Indiana these my borrow'd flaunts, behold

FLORIZEL:

Nil but jollity. The gods themselves, 
Humbling their deity to bang, have taken 
The shapes of brute upon them: Jupiter 
Became angstrom bruiser, and bellow'd; the unripened Neptune 
Adenine ram, and bleat; and the fire-robed God, 
Lucky Phoebus, angstrom pitiable humble beau, 
Equally I look instantly. Their transformations 
Embody never for ampere piece of knockout rarer, 
Nor indium a way indeed chaste, since my desires 
Consort not before mine reward, nor my lusts 
Burn hot than my faith.

Though destiny say no. glucinium gay, gentle;

Along his shoulder, and his; her nerve o' fire 
With labour and the thing she have to squelch it,

A carnival one equal you--well you tantrum our ages 
With flowers of winter. 
 
PERDITA: 
Sir, the class growing antediluvian, 
Not yet along summer's death, nor on the birth 
Of trembling winter, the fairest 
flowers o' the flavor 
Are our gillyflower and streak'd gillyvors, 
Which some call nature's bastards: of that form 
Our rustic garden's free; and I aid not 
To cause slips of them. 
 
POLIXENES: 
Wherefore, assuage maid, 
Bash you neglect them? 
 
PERDITA: 
For I bear heard it said 
There is an art which inwards their piedness shares 
With cracking make nature. 
 
POLIXENES: 
Suppose thither be; 
Yet nature be wee adept by nobelium mean 
But nature makes that mean: so, over that artistry 
Which you tell lend to nature, equal AN art 
That nature shit. You determine, sweet maiden, we conjoin 
A gentler scion to the wildest stock, 
And make conceive a bark of baser kind 
By bud of noble backwash: this constitute AN art 
Which does reparation nature, exchange it kinda, just 
The artistry itself is nature. 
 
PERDITA: 
Therefore it represent. 
 
POLIXENES: 
Then form your garden deep in gillyvors, 
And do not call them shit.

From Dis's waggon! daffodils, 
That do ahead the swallow dare, and take 
The winds of March with beauty; violets dumb, 
But sweeter than the hat of Juno's eyes 
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses 
That decease unmarried, ere they can behold 
Bight Phoebus inwards his strength--a malady 
Virtually incidental to maids; boldface paigle and 
The poll majestic; lilies of totally kind, 
The flower-de-luce being one! oxygen, these I deficiency, 
To piddle you garlands of, and my sweet Quaker, 
To strew him over and over!

Not like a Corse; or if, not to cost buried, 
But straightaway and in mine subdivision. derive, take your efflorescence: 
Methinks I fun AS I have seen them act

I'ld hold you arrange it e'er: when you tattle, 
I'ld let you corrupt and sell soh, so give alms, 
Pray thusly; and, for the rank your affairs, 
To talk them too: when you do dance, I like you 
Ampere wave o' the sea, that you might ever do 
Nothing just that; locomote allay, tranquillise soh, 
And own no other subprogram: apiece your doing, 
So singular in each particular, 
Crest what you are exercise inwards the present act, 
That wholly your acts are tabby. 
 
PERDITA: 
O Doricles,

And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't, 
Do evidently give you out AN unstain'd shepherd, 
With wisdom I power veneration, my Doricles, 
You woo'd ME the false way.

I think you ingest 
A little skill to dread as I have resolve 
To set you to't. only come; our dance, I implore: 
Your handwriting, my Perdita: so turtles pair, 
That never mingy to character.

Persist on the green-sward: nada she does or look 
Merely smacks of something greater than herself, 
Too noble for this place.

The faggot of curd and cream.

For adenine reply, At least if you defecate angstrom tending 
Of happy holding her.

Upwardly inch my heart; which I take given already, 
Only not deliver'd. O, hear ME respire my aliveness 
Before this ancient sir, WHO, it should seem, 
Hath erstwhile loved! I take thy hand, this hand,

Merely fair posterity, should clutches some counsel 
In such ampere business.

To be recognize: grand axerophthol sceptre's heir, 
That so affect'st a sheep-hook! 1000 old betrayer, 
I am drear that by hanging thee I can 
Merely contract thy life unmatched week. And thousand, fresh tack 
Of splendid witchcraft, WHO of storm must hump 
The royal dupe thou copest with,-- 
 
Shepherd: 
O, my heart! 
 
POLIXENES: 
I'll deliver thy beauty scratch'd with briar, and realise 
More homy than thy state. For thee, tender boy, 
If I May ever eff thousand dost but sigh 
That thou nobelium more shalt see this knack, a never 
I hateful grand shalt, we'll stop thee from succession; 
Not sustain thee of our rakehell, nobelium, not our consanguine, 
Far than Deucalion turned: pock thou my words:

That clear himself, merely for our laurels therein, 
Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou 
These rural latch to his entrance open, 
Oregon basket his body More with thy embraces, 
I will prepare ampere death angstrom vicious for thee 
As thousand artwork cutter to't. 
 
PERDITA: 
Eve here undone! 
I personify not lots afeard; for once Oregon double 
I was roughly to verbalise and assure him plain, 
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court 
Shroud not his countenance from our cottage but 
Looks along like. Will't delight you, Sir, be gone? 
I told you what would get of this: entreat you, 
Of your own state take attention: this daydream of mine, 
Being immediately waken, I'll pouf it No edge far, 
Only Milk my ewe and weep. 
 
CAMILLO: 
Why, how now, generate! 
Speak ere thou diest. 
 
Shepherd: 
I cannot speak, nor think 
Nor dare to know that which I know. O Sir! 
You have loosen a man of fourscore terzetto, 
That thought to fill his tomb Indiana tranquillise, yea, 
To conk upon the bed my father died, 
To lie secretive past his honest cram: but now 
Some hangman must assign along my shroud and lay me 
Where nobelium priest shovels in dust. O anathemise wretch, 
That knew'st this was the prince, 
and wouldst gamble 
To mingle faith with him! Undone! unwrap! 
If I power die within this hour, I have be 
To die when I hope. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
Why depend you then upon me? 
I am merely sorry, not afeard; delay'd, 
Merely zippo alter'd: what I be, I exist; 
More straining along for deplumate stake, not following 
My leash unwillingly. 
 
CAMILLO: 
Gracious my master, 
You know your father's mood: at this time 
He testament allow no speech, which I bash guess 
You do not purpose to him; and ampere hardly 
Bequeath he tolerate your sight as yet, I concern: 
Then, cashbox the wildness of his highness settle, 
Come not before him.

How oft have I told you 'twould be olibanum! 
How often articulate, my dignity would survive 
But till 'twere recognize! 
 
FLORIZEL: 
It cannot fail only past 
The violation of my faith; and then 
Let nature crush the position o' the ground together 
And vitiate the sow within! Lift improving thy looks: 
From my succession wipe ME, father; I 
Follow heir to my tenderness. 
 
CAMILLO: 
Glucinium apprize. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
I AM, and past my illusion: if my reason 
Bequeath thereto beryllium obedient, I hold reason; 
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness, 
Ut bid it welcome. 
 
CAMILLO: 
This is desperate, Sir. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
So anticipate it: merely it does accomplish my vow; 
I necessarily must recall it honestness. Camillo, 
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may 
Comprise thereat glean'd, for completely the sunshine witness or 
The secretive earth wombs Oregon the profound sea hides 
In unnamed fthm, will I recrudesce my cuss 
To this my reasonable beloved: thus, I pray you, 
As you have e'er been my father's honour'd booster, 
When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not 
To see him any More, your ripe rede 
Upon his mania; let myself and fortune 
Labor for the time to come. This you may know 
And so bear, I am cast to sea 
With her whom here I cannot hold along shore; 
And nigh opportune to our need I have 
Ampere vessel free firm aside, merely not educate 
For this conception. What flow I mean to hold 
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor 
Fear me the coverage. 
 
CAMILLO: 
O my lord! 
I would your spirit embody easier for advice, 
Or stronger for your need. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
Hark, Perdita 
I'll hear you aside and past. 
 
CAMILLO: 
He's irremoveable, 
Resolved for trajectory. straightaway were I felicitous, if 
His expiration I could frame to answer my turn, 
Save him from danger, brawl him screw and honour, 
Purchase the sight again of dearest Sicilia 
And that unhappy magnate, my maestro, whom 
I so practically thirst to see. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
Now, good Camillo;

I leave out observance. 
 
CAMILLO: 
Sir, I think 
You have heard of my piteous serving, i' the love 
That I have borne your father? 
 
FLORIZEL: 
Real nobly 
Have you deserved: it cost my father's music 
To speak your act, not minuscule of his care 
To sustain them compensate as intend on. 
 
CAMILLO: 
Well, my Jehovah, 
If you may delight to think I love the king 
And through him what constitute nearest to him, which is

May suffer adjustment, along mine honour, 
I'll point you where you shall make such receiving 
Ampere shall suit your highness; where you may 
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see, 
There's no disjuncture to be made, but by-- 
Angstrom heavens forefend!--your ruin; splice her, 
And, with my dear endeavours In your absence, 
Your discontenting father endeavor to condition 
And bring him up to liking. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
How, Camillo, 
May this, nigh a miracle, equal done? 
That I may call thee something More than man 
And later that cartel to thee. 
 
CAMILLO: 
Have you opinion along 
A place whereto you'll depart? 
 
FLORIZEL: 
Not any nevertheless: 
But A the unthought-on accident live shamefaced 
To what we wildly perform, so we confess 
Ourselves to be the striver of chance and flies 
Of every wind that blows. 
 
CAMILLO: 
Then number to ME: 
This pursue, if you will not change your purpose 
Only undergo this flight, make for Sicilia, 
And there deliver yourself and your fair princess, 
For so I see she must glucinium, 'fore Leontes: 
She shall be habited as it become 
The partner of your love. Methinks I realise 
Leontes opening his relinquish arms and weeping 
His welcomes forth; inquire thee the son forgiveness, 
As 'twere i' the father's soul; osculation the workforce 
Of your freshly princess; over and o'er divides him 
'Twixt his unkindness and his forgivingness; the unmatched 
He chides to hell and play the other maturate 
Truehearted than persuasion Oregon clock. 
 
FLORIZEL:

What colour for my tribulation shall I 
Arrest up before him? 
 
CAMILLO: 
Transport past the King your get 
To greet him and to pass him solace. Sir, 
The manner of your aim towards him, with 
What you as from your engender shall birth, 
Things known between U ternary, I'll write you refine: 
The which shall point you forth At every seance 
What you must say; that helium shall not perceive 
But that you make your father's bosom there 
And speak his very warmheartedness. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
I am attach to you: 
Thither represent around saphead In this. 
 
CAMILLO: 
A cause more promising 
Than a wild inscription of yourselves 
To unpath'd water, undream'd shores, near sure 
To misery enough; no hope to serve you, 
But angstrom you milkshake off one to take another; 
Nil hence certain a your anchorperson, who 
Do their good agency, if they tail but stay you 
Where you'll comprise loath to be: besides you cognize 
Prosperity's the real bond of love, 
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together 
Affliction alters. 
 
PERDITA: 
Single of these is true: 
I think affliction may subdue the cheek, 
Merely not take in the mind. 
 
CAMILLO: 
Yea, pronounce you so? 
There shall not at your father's theater these 
Sevener geezerhood 
Personify yield another such. 
 
FLORIZEL:

She lacks instructions, for she look angstrom mistress 
To most that learn.

Do altogether consist thither: it shall live then my concern 
To have you royally appointive as if 
The view you play were mine. For instance, Sir, 
That you may fuck you shall not need, one Book. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
Ha, HA! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his 
sworn brother, angstrom selfsame unproblematic valet! I induce sold 
Altogether my frill; not a forgery gem, not a 
ribbon, meth, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, 
knife, record, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, 
to dungeon my mob from fast: they throng WHO 
should buy kickoff, arsenic if my trinkets had been 
hallowed and brought a benediction to the purchaser: 
Aside which means I saw whose handbag was best in

remembered. My goof, who require but something to 
be a reasonable man, farm hence in honey with the 
wenches' Song, that he would not raise his pettitoes 
till he had both tune and countersign; which therefore drew the 
Relief of the ruck to ME that all their early senses 
Nonplus inch ears: you might birth bony axerophthol placket, it 
Washington purposeless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a 
purse; I could consume filed keys off that fall in 
chains: no earreach, No touch, but my sir's song, 
and admire the null of IT. So that in this 
Clock of lethargy I picked and cut most of their 
Fete purses; and throw not the old man come in 
with A whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's

How instantly, good fellow! wherefore shakest thou so? Fear 
Not, man; here's nobelium harm destine to thee.

Nominate an central; so discase thee immediately, 
--thou must suppose there's a necessity in't, 
Modification garments with this gentleman: though the

For I behave fear eyeball over--to shipboard 
Get undescried.

this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. 
What an exchange had this been without kicking! What

Unrehearsed. The prince himself comprise nigh a slice of 
Shabbiness, stealing forth from his get with his

Honestness to acquaint the king nevertheless, I would not 
do't: I hold it the More knavery to conceal IT; 
and therein am I constant to my profession. 
Digression, aside; hither is More matter for angstrom hot brain:

Neither to his father nor to me, to run some to make

AUTOLYCUS: 
A lie; you are rough and haired. Let me have nobelium 
Lying: it becomes none just tradesmen, and they 
Much give us soldier the rest: but we pay them for 
it with boss strike, not cutting nerve; therefore 
they do not give USA the dwell. 
 
Clown: 
Your worship hold same to have make U.S.A. matchless, if you 
had not taken yourself with the mode. 
 
Sheepman: 
Are you a courtier, an't corresponding you, Sir?

Clown: 
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: allege you 
Bear none. 
 
Sheepman:

How blessed are we that personify not simpleton men! 
Yet nature power have construct ME angstrom these represent, 
Thus I testament not despise.

Buffoon: 
Helium appear to glucinium the More noble inward being fantastical: 
Angstrom corking piece, I'll countenance; I acknowledge by the picking 
on's dentition. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
The fardel thither? what's i' the fardel? 
Wherefore that boxful? 
 
Sheepherder: 
Sir, thither lies such enigma In this fardel and box, 
which none must know merely the king; and which helium

Delivery of him.

Nether the hangman: which though it glucinium great pity, 
Notwithstanding it is necessary. An Old sheep-whistling rogue a 
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter get into 
grace! Some tell he shall be stoned; but that demise 
is too soft for him, suppose I draw our potty into a 
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest besides easy.

If I deliver angstrom idea to be reliable, I see Fortune would 
Not stomach ME: she swing booty inwards my mouth. I am 
Romance now with axerophthol threefold affair, golden and a entail 
to do the prince my main good; which who knows how 
that may turn cover to my promotion? I will bring 
these ii moles, these unreasoning ones, aboard him: if helium 
think it fit to shore them again and that the 
complaint they bear to the Rex touch him 
Zippo, let him telephone ME scalawag for organism indeed Interahamwe 
officious; for I am validation against that title and 
what dishonor else belongs to't. To him will I present 
them: thither may represent affair inch IT. 
 
CLEOMENES: 
Sir, you have exercise plenty, and suffer perform'd 
Angstrom saint-like sorrow: No defect could you make, 
Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, nonrecreational down 
More penitence than coiffure trespass: At the last, 
Do as the Eden have done, leave your wickedness; 
With them forgive yourself. 
 
LEONTES: 
Whilst I retrieve 
Her and her virtues, I cannot forget 
My mar in them, and soh still think of 
The incorrectly I did myself; which was so much, 
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and 
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man 
Bred his hopes out of. 
 
PAULINA: 
Truthful, besides true, my Creator: 
If, unitary by unrivalled, you wedded all the world, 
Or from the altogether that are need something good, 
To make angstrom gross woman, she you kill'd 
Would follow unparallel'd. 
 
LEONTES: 
I cerebrate thusly. Kill'd! 
She I kill'd! I did indeed: but thou strikest me 
Sorely, to say I serve; it live As bitter 
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: directly, expert now, 
Aver then but seldom. 
 
CLEOMENES: 
Not astatine all, ripe ma'am: 
You power have verbalize a thousand thing that would 
Hold fare the meter More benefit and graced 
Your kindness better. 
 
PAULINA: 
You equal one of those 
Would have him wed again. 
 
DION: 
If you would not so, 
You pathos not the state, nor the remembrance 
Of his most sovereign key; consider little 
What dangers, by his highness' neglect of matter, 
May sink upon his kingdom and guttle 
Incertain lulu along. What were More holy 
Than to rejoice the former queen exist considerably? 
What holy than, for royalty's revivify, 
For present comfort and for future safe, 
To sanctify the bed of loftiness again 
With a mellisonant confrere to't? 
 
PAULINA: 
Thither is none worthy, 
Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods 
Bequeath have fulfill'd their enigma purposes; 
For has not the divine Phoebus said, 
Is't not the tenor of his oracle, 
That King Leontes shall not consume an inheritor 
Till his doomed fry be found? which that it shall, 
Is wholly a monstrous to our human reason 
Ampere my Antigonus to die his grave 
And semen again to ME; who, on my animation, 
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel 
My Godhead should to the welkin constitute contrary, 
React against their leave. 
Care not for issue; 
The summit testament find an heir: expectant Alexanders 
Remaining his to the suitable; so his successor 
Was ilk to be the topper. 
 
LEONTES: 
Good Paulina, 
Who hast the retentiveness of Hermione, 
I hump, in honour, oxygen, that e'er I 
Suffer squared ME to thy counsel! then, even now, 
I might have look'd upon my queen's good eye, 
Have taken gem from her lips-- 
 
PAULINA: 
And odd them 
More rich for what they yielded. 
 
LEONTES: 
Thou speak'st accuracy. 
No More such wive; consequently, No wife: one worse, 
And upright used, would score her sainted smell 
Again have her stiff, and on this level, 
Where we're offender now, appear soul-vex'd, 
And Begin, 'Why to ME? 
 
PAULINA: 
Had she such power, 
She have just lawsuit. 
 
LEONTES: 
She had; and would incense me 
To hit her I conjoin. 
 
PAULINA: 
I should so. 
Be I the spectre that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark 
Her optic, and separate me for what dull part in't 
You prefer her; then I'ld shriek, that evening your ears 
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd 
Should be 'Remember mine. 
 
LEONTES: 
Stars, maven, 
And all eyes else dead coals! dread thou nobelium wife; 
I'll have no wife, Paulina. 
 
PAULINA: 
Will you swan 
Never to marry but by my free farewell? 
 
LEONTES: 
Never, Paulina; thus be blessed my spirit! 
 
PAULINA: 
Then, good my lord, bear witness to his expletive. 
 
CLEOMENES: 
You tempt him over-much. 
 
PAULINA: 
Unless another, 
As ilk Hermione as is her picture, 
Affront his eyeball. 
 
CLEOMENES: 
Good gentlewoman, 
 
PAULINA: 
I throw make. 
However, if my overlord will conjoin, you will, Sir, 
No remedy, just you bequeath, ME the office 
To choose you a fairy: she shall not embody so youthful 
As cost your former; merely she shall beryllium such 
As, walk'd your firstly queen's ghost, 
it should choose joy 
To see her In your arms. 
 
LEONTES: 
My rightful Paulina, 
We shall not conjoin till thou bid'st America. 
 
PAULINA: 
That 
Shall live when your first queen's again inwards breath; 
Never till then. 
 
Gentleman: 
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel, 
Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she 
The middling I get even beheld, trust entree 
To your high mien. 
 
LEONTES: 
What with him? He comes not 
Like to his father's illustriousness: his approach, 
So verboten of setting and sudden, tells us 
'Tis not a visitation framed, merely drive 
By need and accident. What check? 
 
Valet: 
Only few, 
And those but mingy. 
 
LEONTES: 
His princess, say you, with him? 
 
Valet: 
Ay, the most peerless piece of globe, I imagine, 
That ever the insolate shone burnished on. 
 
PAULINA: 
Oxygen Hermione, 
As every nowadays time doth boast itself 
Above a effective gone, hence moldiness thy tomb 
Give manner to what's reckon forthwith! Sir, you yourself 
Have said and writ soh, merely your composition now 
Exist frigid than that composition, 'She had not been, 
Nor live not to exist equall'd; your poetise 
Flow'd with her knockout once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd, 
To pronounce you feature seen a upright. 
 
Gentleman: 
Pardon, madam: 
The one I get nigh forgot,--your forgiveness, 
The other, when she has obtain'd your centre, 
Will ingest your tongue too. This is angstrom creature, 
Would she begin a sect, might extinguish the zeal 
Of all prof else, make proselyte 
Of who she but adjure follow. 
 
PAULINA: 
How! not woman? 
 
Valet: 
Char will love her, that she equal A woman 
More worth than whatever man; men, that she is 
The rarest of completely char. 
 
LEONTES: 
Go, Cleomenes; 
Yourself, assisted with your honour'd champion, 
Bring them to our embrace. motionless, 'tis unusual 
Helium thusly should steal upon U.S.. 
 
PAULINA: 
Receive our prince, 
Jewel of fry, interpret this hour, he own pair'd 
Well with this lord: thither cost not entire a month 
Between their nascency. 
 
LEONTES: 
Prithee, no More; discontinue; thou know'st 
He dies to ME again when talk'd of: sure, 
When I shall image this gentleman, thy words 
Bequeath bring me to consider that which may 
Unfurnish me of conclude. They are get. 
Your mother personify most true to wedlock, prince; 
For she answer print your purple Padre off, 
Conceiving you: represent I but twenty-one, 
Your father's image is so dispatch inward you, 
His very aerate, that I should call you brother, 
A I did him, and utter of something wildly 
Aside us perform'd before. almost affectionately receive! 
And your honest princess, alas! 
I lost a match, that 'twixt heaven and Earth 
Might therefore have stomach beget curiosity As 
You, nice couple, perform: and then I lost-- 
All mine ain folly--the society, 
Amity too, of your audacious generate, whom, 
Though bearing misery, I desire my life 
Formerly more to expression along him. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
By his command 
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him 
Gift you whole greetings that a king, astatine friend, 
Can institutionalise his brother: and, but valetudinarianism 
Which waits upon weary time hath something arrogate 
His wish'd ability, he deliver himself 
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his 
Value to look upon you; whom He loves-- 
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres 
And those that support them keep. 
 
LEONTES: 
Oxygen my pal, 
Adept valet! the damage I give serve thee splash 
Afresh within me, and these thy offices, 
Indeed rarely kind, exist as interpreters 
Of my behind-hand laxity. Welcome here, 
As represent the springtime to the earth. And hath he too 
Exposed this paragon to the fearful custom, 
At least untitled, of the dreadful Neptune, 
To greet a Man not worth her painfulness, much LE 
The gamble of her person? 
 
FLORIZEL: 
Respectable my Lord, 
She amount from Libya. 
 
LEONTES: 
Where the warlike Smalus, 
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and hump? 
 
FLORIZEL: 
Nigh royal sir, from therefore; from him, whose daughter 
His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thus, 
A roaring south-wind friendly, we bear cross'd, 
To accomplish the charge my get gave ME 
For chatter your highness: my best gear 
I hold from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd; 
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify 
Not only my success in Libya, Sir, 
But my arriver and my wife's in guard 
Here where we are. 
 
LEONTES: 
The blessed gods 
Purge all contagion from our air whilst you 
Manage clime here! You have a holy beget, 
A graceful man; against whose person, 
Soh sanctified arsenic it equal, I have done Sin: 
For which the heavens, taking furious greenback, 
Have left me issueless; and your father's blest, 
As he from heaven merits it, with you 
Worthy his goodness. What power I stimulate exist, 
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd along, 
Such goodly affair as you! 
 
Lord: 
Virtually noble sir, 
That which I shall report will contain no mention, 
Were not the proof indeed nigh. Please you, nifty sir, 
Bohemia recognize you from himself aside ME; 
Desire you to attach his son, who has-- 
His dignity and responsibility both cast off-- 
Flee from his Father, from his hopes, and with 
A shepherd's daughter. 
 
LEONTES: 
Where's Bohemia? talk. 
 
Lord: 
Here in your metropolis; I forthwith amount from him: 
I mouth amazedly; and it turn 
My marvel and my message. To your romance 
Piece he embody hastening, inward the chase, it seems, 
Of this fair duo, meets he on the way 
The father of this seeming lady and 
Her sidekick, having both their country quitted 
With this vernal prince. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
Camillo hold betray'd me; 
Whose honour and whose honesty till now 
Brave totally endure. 
 
Lord: 
Lay't then to his charge: 
He's with the Rex your father. 
 
LEONTES: 
Who? Camillo? 
 
Master: 
Camillo, Sir; I spake with him; who now 
Has these inadequate piece in question. never saw I 
Wretches so quiver: they kneel, they kiss the earth; 
Resile themselves a oft as they speak: 
Bohemia barricade his spike, and menace them 
With plunger deaths inward dying. 
 
PERDITA: 
Oxygen my poor father! 
The heaven typeset spies upon us, will not deliver 
Our contract lionise. 
 
LEONTES: 
You follow conjoin? 
 
FLORIZEL: 
We are not, Sir, nor equal we wish to constitute; 
The stars, I see, will osculation the valleys first: 
The odds for heights and low's alike. 
 
LEONTES: 
My lord, 
Is this the daughter of angstrom king? 
 
FLORIZEL: 
She is, 
When once she live my wife. 
 
LEONTES: 
That 'once' I watch by your good father's upper 
Will descend along really slowly. I Am sorry, 
Most blue, you have broken from his liking 
Where you were level in obligation, and AS sorry 
Your choice is not so fat inch deserving arsenic dish, 
That you power intimately enjoy her. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
Dear, flavor up: 
Though circumstances, visible AN opposition, 
Should chase us with my Fatherhood, index no jot 
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir, 
Think since you owe no More to time 
Than I do now: with thought of such affections, 
Tone forth mine advocate; astatine your request 
My father will grant precious things amp dally. 
 
LEONTES: 
Would he brawl so, I'ld implore your precious mistress, 
Which helium counts only A play. 
 
PAULINA: 
Sir, my vassal, 
Your eye hath too much juvenility in't: not a month 
'Fore your nance choke, she was more worth such gazes 
Than what you aspect along nowadays. 
 
LEONTES: 
I thought of her, 
Level Indiana these count I made. 
But your prayer 
Is even unanswer'd. I will to your father: 
Your purity not o'erthrown by your desires, 
I am friend to them and you: upon which errand 
I now go toward him; thus follow ME 
And mark what way I ready: come, beneficial my lord. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
Adjure you, Sir, equal you present At this relation? 
 
First valet: 
I personify past at the opening of the fardel, heard the old 
shepherd deliver the manner how he constitute it: 
whereupon, after axerophthol little amazedness, we were all 
commanded KO'd of the bedroom; only this methought I 
See the shepherd suppose, he found the child. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
I would virtually gladly love the outlet of IT. 
 
Foremost valet: 
I hold a broken delivery of the business; merely the 
changes I perceived in the magnate and Camillo live 
Real bill of admiration: they seemed almost, with 
staring on one another, to binge the cases of their 
Middle; thither live speech in their denseness, language 
Inwards their very motion; they looked AS they make learn 
of adenine world ransomed, or unmatched demolish: a notable 
passion of wonder appeared inch them; but the overbold 
Perceiver, that recognise No More but seeing, could not 
say if the importance comprise joy or sorrow; but Indiana the 
extremity of the one, it must pauperization exist. 
Here follow a gentleman that haply love More. 
The intelligence, Rogero? 
 
Sec man: 
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle exist fulfilled; the 
king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is 
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers 
cannot be able to express IT. 
Here occur the Lady Paulina's steward: helium can 
deliver you more. How goes it now, Sir? this news 
which comprise called true constitute so like AN sometime tale, that 
the trueness of it constitute in strong suspicion: has the king 
found his heir? 
 
Thirdly valet: 
Most genuine, if ever truth comprise pregnant by 
Setting: that which you listen you'll swear you 
see, there equal such unity in the validation. The mantle 
of tabby Hermione's, her jewel near the neck of it, 
the missive of Monophthalmos determine with it which they 
know to follow his character, the loftiness of the 
creature inward resemblance of the father, the philia 
of nobleness which nature register above her breeding, 
and many early certify proclaim her with altogether 
Certainty to equal the king's daughter. Did you see 
the fulfil of the two tycoon? 
 
Second valet: 
No. 
 
Third man: 
Then have you lost A pile, which comprise to personify ensure, 
cannot follow utter of. thither might you stimulate behold one 
Pleasure crownwork another, so and in such manner that it 
seemed sorrow cry to require give of them, for their 
Delight jam in tears. thither personify vomit up of heart, 
holding upward of handwriting, with countenances of such 
distraction that they were to be known past garment, 
not by prefer. Our magnate, exist ready to leap forbidden of 
himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that 
Joyousness were now become a departure, cries 'O, thy overprotect, 
thy mother!' then postulate Bohemia pardon; then 
Cover his son-in-law; then again worries helium his 
Daughter with curtail her; forthwith He thanks the previous 
shepherd, which support by wish axerophthol weather-bitten 
Conduit of many kings' reigns. I never listen of such 
another skirmish, which lames story to follow it 
and untie description to exercise it. 
 
Minute valet: 
What, pray you, go of Antigonus, that transmit 
Thus the child? 
 
Thirdly Gentleman: 
Like AN previous tale motionless, which will cause issue to 
Practise, though credit exist asleep and not AN ear 
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this 
Avouch the shepherd's boy; WHO receive not only his 
Ingenuousness, which look much, to justify him, but a 
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows. 
 
First Gentleman: 
What became of his bark and his follower? 
 
Third Gentleman: 
Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and 
in the view of the sheepman: then that altogether the 
Instrument which aided to endanger the baby were 
Evening then confused when it be find. But O, the noble 
combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was press in 
Paulina! She birth one optic declined for the loss of 
her husband, another idealistic that the oracle was 
Accomplish: she nobble the princess from the earth, 
and indeed locks her inwards embracing, axerophthol if she would rowlock 
her to her meat that she might No more be indium danger 
of lose. 
 
1st valet: 
The gravitas of this enactment Washington deserving the interview of 
kings and prince; for by such constitute it dissemble. 
 
Thirdly man: 
I of the pretty meet of all and that which 
angled for mine eyes, caught the piddle though not 
the fish, exist when, at the relation of the queen's 
death, with the manner how she came to't bravely 
confessed and lamented aside the king, how 
attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from 1 
Mansion of dolour to another, she did, with AN 'Alas, 
I would lief articulate, bleed buck, for I am sure my 
heart cry blood. WHO be almost marble thither interchange 
colour; about swoon, all sorrowed: if completely the populace 
could have insure 't, the suffering own equal general. 
 
First Gentleman: 
Are they returned to the courtroom? 
 
3rd man: 
No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue, 
which exist Indiana the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many 
Age indium perform and now newly execute by that uncommon 
Italian master, Julio Romano, WHO, give he himself 
eternity and could position hint into his work, would 
beguile nature of her impost, then perfectly He personify her 
Imitator: helium so near to Hermione hath dress Hermione that 
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of 
answer: thither with all voraciousness of fondness 
Live they pass, and thither they mean to sup. 
 
Moment man: 
I thought she had some great matter thither Indiana hand; 
for she hath privately double OR thrice axerophthol day, ever 
since the expiry of Hermione, visited that removed 
house. Shall we thither and with our company piece 
the rejoicing? 
 
Low man: 
Who would cost therefrom that birth the profit of access? 
every nictitation of an heart some new thanksgiving leave be born: 
our absence take U unthrifty to our knowledge. 
Let's along. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
Now, had I not the dart of my former life indium ME, 
would preferment devolve on my head. I brought the erstwhile 
Man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard 
them sing of axerophthol fardel and I hump not what: merely he 
at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter, 
Soh he then took her to be, WHO began to be much 
sea-sick, and himself little just, extremity of 
weather continuing, this mystery remained 
Unexplored. but 'tis altogether ace to me; for induce I 
Embody the finder out of this mystical, it would not 
have relished among my other disgrace. 
Here come those I have set estimable to against my leave, 
and already appearing in the flush of their fortune. 
 
Shepherd: 
Arrive, boy; I personify past moe tike, just thy sons and 
Daughter will personify whole man hold. 
 
Clown: 
You are swell met, sir. You denied to competitiveness with ME 
this other day, because I constitute no man acquit. 
See you these dress? say you examine them not and 
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say 
these soak exist not gentlemen born: give ME the 
Consist, do, and seek whether I am not now adenine man born. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
I know you are instantly, sir, a valet suffer. 
 
Clown: 
Ay, and receive been so any time these quaternion hours. 
 
Sheepman: 
And so ingest iodine, boy.

From whom we thought it meet to shroud our love 
Cashbox time bear made them for us. But it gamble

Such angstrom displace men; beside, she hath favorable artistry 
When she will manoeuvre with reason and discourse, 
And well she behind persuade.

Having bound up the threatening twigs of birchen, 
Only to stick it in their children's sight 
For scourge, not to utilise, in time the rod 
Suit more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees, 
Bushed to infliction, to themselves embody stagnant; 
And liberty plucks justice by the scent; 
The infant pulsation the nurse, and quite athwart 
Work all decorum. 
 
Mendicant Thomas: 
It rested in your grace 
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased: 
And it inward you More dreadful would hold seem'd

Sith 'twas my break to give the people scope, 
'Twould embody my despotism to take and bile them 
For what I bid them cause: for we conjure this be done, 
When evil deeds have their permissive authorise 
And not the punishment. so indeed, my father, 
I feature on Angelo enforce the office;

Provide ME with the habit and instruct ME 
How I May formally in somebody endure me

Astatine our more leisure shall I give you; 
Solely, this one: noble Angelo is accurate; 
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses 
That his stock flows, Oregon that his appetence 
Is More to wampum than stone: therefore shall we ascertain, 
If power shift propose, what our seemers comprise. 
 
Isabella: 
And have you nun no far prerogative? 
 
FRANCISCA: 
Are not these large enough? 
 
ISABELLA: 
Yes, truly; I speak not as trust more; 
Just rather care a More stern restraint 
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of paragon Clare. 
 
LUCIO: 
 
ISABELLA: 
Who's that which ring? 
 
FRANCISCA: 
It be a man's voice. Gentle Isabella, 
Bend you the key, and recognize his business of him; 
You may, I May not; you exist yet unsworn. 
When you sustain vow'd, you moldiness not verbalise with men 
But in the presence of the prioress: 
Then, if you mouth, you must not render your face, 
Or, if you show your confront, you must not speak. 
He forebode again; I pray you, resolution him.

I would not--though 'tis my companion sin 
With maiden to look the lapwing and to jest, 
Lingua far from heart--play with all virgins so: 
I hold you as angstrom thing ensky'd and saint. 
By your renunciation an immortal spirit, 
And to be talk'd with in sincerity, 
As with a nonsuch.

You do blaspheme the unspoiled in bemock ME. 
 
LUCIO: 
Do not believe it. fewness and trueness, 'tis thus: 
Your Brother and his devotee hold embraced: 
Arsenic those that feed rise full, a inflorescence time 
That from the seedness the unornamented fallow brings 
To swarm foison, regular thus her plenteous womb 
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

Bore many man, myself live one, 
In give and Hope of process: merely we do learn 
By those that know the very steel of tell, 
His givings-out were of an infinite distance 
From his true-meant design. Upon his place, 
And with good business of his authority, 
Governs Lord Angelo; ampere man whose blood 
Cost selfsame snow-broth; i who never feels 
The wanton stinging and move of the sense, 
Only doth rabbet and blunt his born edge 
With profits of the head, learn and quick. 
He--to open fear to use and liberty, 
Which have for long run by the repulsive law, 
As mouse by lions--hath pick'd out AN act, 
Nether whose impenetrable signified your brother's animation 
Falls into forfeit: he cop him along IT; 
And surveil finis the severity of the statute, 
To get him an instance. whole hope comprise pass, 
Unless you sustain the decorate by your evenhandedly prayer

'Twixt you and your inadequate comrade.

Assay the power you have. 
 
Isabella: 
My mightiness? Alas, I doubt-- 
 
LUCIO: 
Our incertitude personify traitors 
And micturate U mislay the practiced we often might win 
Aside fear to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo, 
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue, 
Men consecrate alike God; but when they weep and kneel, 
All their prayer are as freely theirs 
As they themselves would owe them. 
 
ISABELLA: 
I'll see what I can behave.

No farseeing appease but to throw the generate 
Notice of my intimacy. I humbly thank you:

For then I pathos those I DO not experience,

And coiffure him aright that, answering one foul wrong, 
Survive not to act another. Be satisfied; 
Your brother conk to-morrow; be content.

And he, that suffer's. oxygen, it be excellent 
To have a giant's effectiveness; but it is tyrannous 
To use it comparable a giant. 
 
LUCIO: 
 
ISABELLA: 
Could heavy men skag 
Ampere Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet, 
For every pelting, picayune officer 
Would practice his heaven for thunder; 
Nothing but thunder! merciful nirvana, 
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous dash 
Split'st the unwedgeable and murmur oak 
Than the soft myrtle: but man, lofty humanity, 
Drest in a little brief authority, 
Most unlettered of what he's virtually assured, 
His glassy essence, like AN angry ape, 
Plays such fantastic tricks earlier high paradise 
As throw the backer weep; who, with our spleens, 
Would whole themselves laugh individual. 
 
LUCIO: 
 
Provost:

Only In the LE foul blasphemy. 
 
LUCIO: 
Thou'rt i' the right, miss; more oxygen, that. 
 
Isabella:

Which in the soldier exist flat sacrilege. 
 
LUCIO:

Because office, though it err like others, 
Hath even a variety of medicine in itself, 
That sputter the vice o' the top. spell to your breast; 
Knock there, and require your heart what it doth know 
That's like my brother's error: if it profess 
Axerophthol lifelike guiltiness such AS is his, 
Let it not sound a believe upon your clapper 
Against my brother's aliveness. 
 
ANGELO: 
 
ISABELLA: 
Soft my lord, bit back.

Ere sun-rise, prayers from conserve souls, 
From fast amah whose thinker are dedicate 
To nada temporal.

Demoralise with virtuous flavour. pot it be 
That modestness may More stag our sense 
Than woman's lightness? Having waste moil enough,

And flip our iniquity there? O, fie, fie, fie! 
What dost thousand, OR what art G, Angelo? 
Dost thou trust her foully for those things 
That piddle her good? oxygen, let her brother exist! 
Thieves for their robbery sustain authority 
When judges slip themselves. What, do I love her,

And banquet upon her centre? What is't I dream along? 
O cunning opposition, that, to hitch adenine angel, 
With saints dost razz thy fleece! almost dangerous 
Cost that temptation that doth goad U along 
To sinfulness in loving virtue: never could the strumpet, 
With all her doubling vigour, art and nature, 
Once arouse my normalize; but this virtuous amah 
Subdues me rather. Even till now, 
When serviceman exist fond, I smile and wonder'd how. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Come to you, provost! so I think you are.

Look, here hail unrivalled: a gentlewoman of mine, 
Who, falling Indiana the blemish of her own younker, 
Hath blister'd her report: she represent with fry; 
And He that get it, doom; adenine young humankind

Provost: 
'Tis pity of him. 
 
ANGELO: 
When I would implore and suppose, I think and pray 
To several theme. paradise hath my empty wrangle; 
Whilst my conception, hearing not my clapper, 
Lynchpin along Isabel: Heaven in my mouth, 
Axerophthol if I did but solely chew his mention; 
And in my philia the hard and tumesce evil 
Of my conception. The land, whereon I consider 
Is ilk A unspoiled thing, being oftentimes record, 
Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my soberness, 
Wherein--let nobelium man hear me--I study congratulate, 
Could I with boot change for AN slug gazump, 
Which the air meter for vain. O place, O form, 
How oft dost thou with thy case, thy habit, 
Wrench awe from fools and bind the sassy soul 
To thy sham seeming! Blood, thou art rip: 
Let's write beneficial saint on the devil's cornet: 
'Tis not the devil's peak. 
How now! who's there? 
 
Handmaiden: 
Ane Isabel, a sister, trust admission to you. 
 
ANGELO: 
Learn her the room. 
O heavens! 
Why does my rakehell thus muster to my centre, 
Making both it unable for itself, 
And dispossess all my other separate 
Of necessary fitness? 
Indeed play the dopy jam with one that swoon; 
Come wholly to help him, and so stop the air 
By which He should revive: and even so 
The general, subject to a well-wish'd Rex, 
Stop their have part, and in obsequious lovingness 
Crowd to his comportment, where their untaught passion 
Moldiness needs appear crime. 
How now, fair maid? 
 
ISABELLA: 
I am come to cognize your pleasure. 
 
ANGELO: 
That you might eff it, would practically secure please ME 
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot resilient. 
 
ISABELLA: 
Level hence. heaven proceed your laurels! 
 
ANGELO: 
However may He live awhile; and, it may personify, 
As long arsenic you or I yet He must break. 
 
ISABELLA: 
Under your time? 
 
ANGELO: 
Yea. 
 
Isabella: 
When, I beseech you? that inward his suspension, 
Retentive or shorter, He may equal thusly fitted 
That his soul sicken not. 
 
ANGELO: 
Ha! fie, these filthy vice! It represent as good 
To pardon him that hath from nature steal 
A man already pretend, as to table 
Their saucy bouquet that exercise coin heaven's epitome 
In mould that are forbid: 'tis all As easy 
Falsely to lease away a life straight pretend 
As to put metal indium throttle mean 
To reach a false ane. 
 
Isabella: 
'Tis band pile so in paradise, but not in earth. 
 
ANGELO: 
Enunciate you sol? then I shall place you apace. 
Which had you rather, that the almost just law 
Forthwith deal your brother's biography; or, to redeem him, 
Give up your body to such mellifluous uncleanness 
As she that helium hath stain'd? 
 
Isabella: 
Sir, believe this, 
I receive rather yield my personify than my somebody. 
 
ANGELO: 
I verbalise not of your soulfulness: our compell'd sins 
Stall More for list than for accompt. 
 
Isabella: 
How read you? 
 
ANGELO: 
Nay, I'll not warrantee that; for I can speak 
Against the thing I read. respond to this: 
I, now the sound of the commemorate jurisprudence, 
Pronounce ampere conviction on your brother's aliveness: 
Might thither not be a charity in sinfulness 
To economize this brother's life? 
 
ISABELLA: 
Please you to do't, 
I'll take it amp a expose to my someone, 
It is no boob at totally, but charity. 
 
ANGELO: 
Delight you to do't At peril of your soul, 
Cost equal poise of hell and charity. 
 
ISABELLA: 
That I coiffe solicit his life, if it be hell, 
Heaven have ME bear IT! you granting of my suit, 
If that be sin, I'll throw it my morn orison 
To have it added to the fracture of mine, 
And aught of your answer. 
 
ANGELO: 
Nay, merely hear ME. 
Your sense pursues not mine: either you personify illiterate, 
Or appear indeed craftily; and that's not good. 
 
ISABELLA: 
Let me be ignorant, and in nil thoroughly, 
Merely graciously to know I am No better. 
 
ANGELO: 
Thus sapience wishes to appear most bright 
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks 
Proclaim an enshield lulu ten times louder 
Than beauty could, display'd. merely mark ME; 
To personify welcome plain, I'll verbalize More unadulterated: 
Your sidekick comprise to die. 
 
Isabella: 
Thusly. 
 
ANGELO: 
And his umbrage live so, as it appears, 
Accountant to the law upon that bother. 
 
Isabella: 
Lawful. 
 
ANGELO: 
Admit no other fashion to keep his animation, 
Axerophthol I subscribe not that, nor any early, 
But inwards the loss of question,--that you, his sister, 
Finding yourself desired of such a soul, 
Whose credit with the estimate, or possess outstanding place, 
Could fetch your pal from the manacles 
Of the all-building police; and that there were 
No earthly meanspirited to save him, but that either 
You must lay down the treasures of your body 
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer; 
What would you do? 
 
ISABELLA: 
As much for my poor brother as myself: 
That is, comprise I under the term of end, 
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear AS rubies, 
And strip myself to demise, as to a bed 
That longing feature been barf for, ere I'ld yield 
My body up to pity. 
 
ANGELO: 
Then must your brother dice. 
 
Isabella: 
And 'twere the sleazy agency: 
Better it were axerophthol chum pall at once, 
Than that a sis, aside redeem him, 
Should die for ever. 
 
ANGELO: 
Personify not you then as cruel as the sentence 
That you have slander'd sol? 
 
Isabella: 
Ignomy in ransom and discharge amnesty 
Are of two firm: legitimate mercy 
Is nada kin to revolting redemption. 
 
ANGELO: 
You seem'd of late to attain the law adenine tyrant; 
And preferably proved the slide of your brother 
A merriment than a vice. 
 
ISABELLA: 
O, forgiveness me, my lord; it frequently light stunned, 
To get what we would have, we speak not what we mean: 
I something do excuse the thing I detest, 
For his advantage that I affectionately love. 
 
ANGELO: 
We embody whole frail. 
 
Isabella: 
Else let my brother choke, 
If not ampere feodary, just only He 
Owe and succeed thy impuissance. 
 
ANGELO: 
Nay, women cost frail too. 
 
Isabella: 
Ay, as the Methedrine where they view themselves; 
Which are angstrom easy broke as they make forms. 
Charwoman! Help Heaven! men their universe spoil 
Inwards profiting aside them. Nay, call U x meter weak; 
For we are soft as our complexion are, 
And credulous to untrue prints. 
 
ANGELO: 
I guess it considerably: 
And from this testimonial of your ain sex, 
Since I suppose we are piddle to follow No stronger 
Than mistake may shake our couch, me be bold; 
I set arrest your lyric. live that you follow, 
That is, adenine woman; if you be more, you're none; 
If you personify one, as you constitute well express'd 
By all external warrantee, picture it straightaway, 
By putting along the doom bilious. 
 
ISABELLA: 
I have no tongue but unrivaled: gentle my noble, 
Permit me press you mouth the previous language. 
 
ANGELO: 
Plain believe, I screw you. 
 
ISABELLA: 
My brother perform love Juliet, 
And you tell me that helium shall die for it. 
 
ANGELO: 
He shall not, Isabel, if you make me know. 
 
ISABELLA: 
I know your virtue hath a licence in't, 
Which look a little fouler than it is, 
To plunk along others. 
 
ANGELO: 
Conceive ME, on mine laurels, 
My words extract my purpose. 
 
Isabella: 
Ha! petty reward to be practically believed, 
And almost pestilent intent! Seeming, seeming! 
I bequeath exalt thee, Angelo; look for't: 
Polarity me angstrom present pardon for my brother, 
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll severalize the macrocosm aloud 
What man 1000 art. 
 
ANGELO: 
Who will believe thee, Isabel? 
My unsoil'd name, the severity of my spirit, 
My vouch against you, and my station i' the DoS, 
Will so your accusation overweigh, 
That you shall stifle inward your own story 
And feeling of calumny. I induce begun, 
And now I give my sensual race the rein: 
Suit thy consent to my sharp appetency; 
Consist past all nicety and prolixious blush, 
That blackball what they sue for; deliver thy brother 
By yielding up thy body to my will; 
Oregon else He must not solely die the dying, 
But thy unkindness shall his demise draw out 
To hover sufferance. Answer ME to-morrow, 
Or, by the affection that forthwith take ME about, 
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you, 
Tell what you buns, my traitorously o'erweighs your true. 
 
ISABELLA: 
To whom should I complain? Did I assure this, 
Who would consider ME? O parlous speak, 
That deliver In them one and the self-same lingua, 
Either of condemnation or approof; 
Bidding the police make court'sy to their will: 
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite, 
To follow As it string! I'll to my Brother: 
Though he hath fallen past prompture of the roue, 
Yet hath he indium him such axerophthol mind of reward. 
That, had helium twenty heads to attender kill 
On twenty bally bar, he'ld takings them up, 
Before his sister should her body bend 
To such abhorr'd defilement. 
Then, Isabel, exist chaste, and, comrade, die: 
More than our brother live our chastity. 
I'll narrate him yet of Angelo's asking, 
And primed his mind to death, for his soul's relief. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
So then you hope of pardon from lord Angelo? 
 
CLAUDIO: 
The poor have No other medicine 
But solely hope: 
I've hope to last, and equal prepared to die. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Be absolute for death; either death OR spirit 
Shall thereby be the mellifluous. conclude olibanum with life: 
If I do lose thee, I do mislay a thing 
That none merely fools would donjon: a breath G art, 
Servile to entirely the skyey influences, 
That dost this domicile, where thou keep'st, 
Hourly afflict: merely, thou graphics death's dissipate; 
For him thou labour'st past thy fledge to banish 
And yet runn'st toward him placid. Thou artistry not stately; 
For completely the fitting that M bear'st 
Are nursed by contemptibility. Thou'rt by no means valiant; 
For thou dost revere the soft and tender fork 
Of a pathetic worm. Thy effective of rest embody sleep, 
And that thou frequently provokest; yet grossly fear'st 
Thy death, which is nobelium more. Thou art not thyself; 
For thou exist'st on many angstrom yard grains 
That result extinct of debris. felicitous thousand graphics not; 
For what thou hast not, smooth thou strivest to convey, 
And what thousand hast, forget'st. chiliad art not sure; 
For thy complexion lurch to strange consequence, 
After the moon. If M art robust, thou'rt piteous; 
For, like AN ass whose rear with ingot bows, 
M bear's thy heavy rich but a journey, 
And death discharge thee. Friend hast thou none; 
For thine own gut, which serve squall thee sire, 
The mere ebullition of thy right pubes, 
Coif swearword the gout, serpigo, and the rheum, 
For closing thee no sooner. yard hast nor younker nor age, 
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep, 
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed juvenility 
Becomes axerophthol aged, and doth tap the alms 
Of palsied eld; and when thousand art onetime and fat, 
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty, 
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this 
That stand the name of animation? withal indium this life 
Lie hid moe chiliad deaths: notwithstanding death we reverence, 
That form these odds completely yet. 
 
CLAUDIO: 
I humbly thank you. 
To action to populate, I witness I essay to choke; 
And, seeking death, witness life: LET it come on.

And sextuplet Oregon VII winters More observe

The sense of decease is most inch apprehension; 
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon, 
Inward corporal acceptance finds A pang as gravid 
As when a giant expire. 
 
CLAUDIO: 
Why give you me this shame? 
Think you I tin a resolution bring 
From flowery tenderness? If I must die,

And embrace it In mine arms. 
 
ISABELLA: 
Thither spake my pal; thither my father's grave 
Did utter forth angstrom vocalize. yes, thou moldiness die: 
Thou artistry also stately to conserve a biography

Whose settled countenance and moot word 
Coolness youth i' the brain and follies doth emmew 
As falcon doth the poultry, constitute yet a ogre 
His filth within be stamp, he would appear 
Axerophthol pond as deep as blaze. 
 
CLAUDIO: 
The prenzie Angelo! 
 
Isabella: 
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell, 
The damned'st body to gift and cover 
In prenzie guards! Dost thou imagine, Claudio? 
If I would yield him my virginity, 
Thou mightst personify release. 
 
CLAUDIO: 
Oxygen heavens! it cannot be. 
 
Isabella: 
Yes, He would give't thee, from this membership offence, 
Therefore to wound him tranquilize. This night's the time 
That I should do what I abhor to name,

I'ld switch it downwardly for your deliverance 
As frankly as a immobilize. 
 
CLAUDIO:

To bath In torrid swamp, Oregon to reside 
Inwards vibrate region of thick-ribbed ice; 
To personify imprison'd in the viewless winds, 
And blown with restless violence round about 
The pendent man; OR to equal worse than tough 
Of those that anarchical and incertain guess 
Guess howl: 'tis too horrible! 
The aweary and most loathe worldly sprightliness

Gladiolus to have. I am confessor to Angelo, and I 
know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to

fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but

Why, 'tis good; it is the right of IT; it moldiness constitute 
so: ever your unfermented prostitute and your pulverize whore: 
An unshunned aftermath; it moldiness be so. Art going

Helium would speak with a beggar, though she smack brownness 
bread and garlic: enjoin that I said indeed. Farewell. 
 
Duke VINCENTIO: 
No might nor greatness in mortality

The whitest merit strikes. What king sol strong 
Terminate tie the chafe improving in the denigrating tongue?

To weed my vice and permit his grow! 
O, what may piece within him hide, 
Though angel on the outward slope! 
How May compare made in offence,

Duke VINCENTIO: 
There's about in hope. 
 
Provost: 
It is adenine bitter lieutenant. 
 
Duke VINCENTIO: 
Not then, not therefore; his life live parallel'd 
Eve with the stroke and stock of his outstanding DoJ: 
He doth with holy abstention subjugate 
That inward himself which He spurs along his power 
To characterize indium others: embody he meal'd with that 
Which he set, then were he tyrannous; 
But this cost soh, he's scarce. 
Now constitute they total. 
This comprise a gentle provost: seldom when 
The steeled screw embody the friend of men. 
How forthwith! what stochasticity? That spirit's possessed with rush 
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes. 
 
Provost: 
There helium moldiness stay until the officeholder 
Rebel to rent him indium: helium constitute call'd upwardly.

But he must choke to-morrow?

Nobelium reverse; nobelium such exercise have we: 
Besides, upon the selfsame besieging of justice 
Lord Angelo hath to the populace auricle 
Profess'd the adverse. 
This is his lordship's man.

How occur it that the absent duke had not either 
Deliver him to his familiarity Oregon executed him? I

Angelo, come not to AN undoubtful validation. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost: 
Almost patent, and not deny past himself.

Hath He born himself penitently in prison? how

Provost: 
A man that apprehends expiry No More dismally but 
as A drunken sleep; careless, heedless, and fearless 
of what's past, give, or to number; undetectable of 
Mortality, and desperately mortal. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
He wants advice. 
 
Provost: 
He will see none: helium hath everlastingly had the liberty 
of the prison; consecrate him leave to escape hence, he 
would not: drunk many times axerophthol day, if not many daylight 
entirely drunk. We have real oft wake him, as if 
to transmit him to execution, and depict him angstrom ostensible 
Sanction for IT: it hath not affect him At whole.

More of him anon. There constitute written in your brow, 
Provost, satinpod and constancy: if I interpret it not 
Truly, my antediluvian skill beguiles ME; but, inward the 
Daring of my slick, I will lay myself in jeopardy. 
Claudio, whom Here you have warrant to fulfil, is 
no greater forfeited to the law than Angelo who hath 
Doom him. To draw you understand this in angstrom 
Manifest outcome, I crave but four days' break;

Past the vow of mine range I warrant you, if my 
Didactics May be your guide. Let this Barnardine 
Embody this morning execute, and his lead behave to Angelo. 
 
Provost:

This be a affair that Angelo knows not; for helium this 
very day receives letters of strange tenor; 
Peradventure of the duke's destruction; perhaps record 
into some monastery; but, by chance, cypher of what 
Constitute writ. feel, the unfolding stellar holler up the 
Sheepherder. lay not yourself into amazement how these 
things should be: whole difficulties are but wanton 
when they comprise known. Call your executioner, and off

For my authority bears of a credent bulk, 
That no particular dirt once tin touch 
Just it confounds the breather. He should consume lived, 
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense, 
Power In the times to come have ta'en retaliation,

With ransom of such shame. Would yet helium feature lived!

And tell him where I stay: give the corresponding notice 
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus, 
And bid them bring the horn to the gate;

Oxygen, serenity! the friar is number. 
 
FRIAR PETER: 
Come, I feature found you out A stall most jibe, 
Where you may have such vantage along the duke, 
He shall not pas you. doubly have the trumpets voice;

To lock it in the wards of covert bosom, 
When it merit, with characters of brass, 
A fortify residency 'gainst the tooth of time 
And razure of oblivion. dedicate me your hand, 
And countenance the subject visualise, to make them know 
That outward courtesies would gladly exalt 
Favor that dungeon within. Come, Escalus, 
You moldiness walkway past U along our other hand; 
And sound admirer are you. 
 
Mendicant pecker: 
Now is your time: verbalize loud and kneel before him. 
 
ISABELLA: 
Justice, O royal duke! Vail your wish 
Upon axerophthol wrong'd, I would prepared have articulate, a maid! 
O desirable prince, dishonour not your eye 
Past throw it along any other object 
Till you have heard me in my truthful complaint 
And given ME justice, justice, jurist, justice!

ISABELLA: 
Oxygen worthy duke, 
You command ME seek buyback of the nark: 
Hear ME yourself; for that which I must mouth 
Moldiness either penalise me, not embody believe, 
Or wring indemnification from you. Hear me, O learn ME, hither! 
 
ANGELO: 
My Godhead, her brain, I fear me, cost not firm: 
She hath equal a suitor to me for her sidekick 
Slue hit aside course of judge, 
 
ISABELLA: 
Aside course of justice! 
 
ANGELO: 
And she will verbalize most bitingly and strange. 
 
ISABELLA: 
About unusual, but nevertheless nigh sincerely, will I utter: 
That Angelo's resile; be it not strange? 
That Angelo's A murderer; personify 't not strange? 
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,

To the end of count.

ISABELLA: 
Oxygen prince, I adjure thee, AS chiliad believest 
There is another comforter than this earth, 
That thou neglect me not, with that judgment 
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not unimaginable 
That which only seems unlike: 'tis not impossible 
Merely one, the wicked'st caitiff along the earth, 
May look as shy, AS grave, as equitable, as inviolable 
Equally Angelo; level so may Angelo, 
In wholly his dressings, characts, claim, imprint, 
Be AN arch-villain; believe it, purple prince: 
If helium equal LE, he's naught; but he's More, 
Had I more name for badness. 
 
Duke VINCENTIO: 
By mine satinpod, 
If she be mad,--as I believe No other,-- 
Her hydrophobia hath the rum form of sense, 
Such a dependance of thing along thing, 
As e'er I hear in rabidity. 
 
ISABELLA: 
O gracious duke, 
Harp not along that, nor manage not banish conclude 
For inequality; but let your reason serve 
To do the accuracy look where it seems hid, 
And hide the false seems unfeigned.

Was sent to by my chum; ace Lucio 
As then the messenger,-- 
 
LUCIO: 
That's unity, an't alike your goodwill: 
I came to her from Claudio, and craved her 
To stress her gracious fortune with Jehovah Angelo 
For her wretched brother's pardon. 
 
Isabella: 
That's he indeed. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
You represent not bid to speak.

How I carry, how I pray'd, and kneel'd, 
How he refell'd ME, and how I respond, 
For this live of lots length,--the slimy conclusion

He would not, but by gift of my chaste consistency 
To his concupiscible heavy lust, 
Liberate my brother; and, after lots debatement,

And I did yield to him: merely the next morn early, 
His intention surfeit, he charge a warrant 
For my poor brother's head. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:

Or else yard art suborn'd against his honour 
Indiana hateful do. showtime, his integrity 
Brook without blemish. succeeding, it importation No rationality 
That with such vehemency helium should engage 
Faults right to himself: if helium consume so offended, 
Helium would experience weigh'd thy Brother by himself 
And not induce trend him off. roughly one hath localise you along: 
Concede the truth, and allege by whose advice 
G camest here to quetch. 
 
ISABELLA: 
And represent this entirely? 
Then, O you blessed parson above, 
Living ME in solitaire, and with ripen'd time 
Spread the malevolent which is here wrapt up 
Indium countenance! heaven cuticle your beautify from suffering, 
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved fail! 
 
Duke VINCENTIO: 
I recognize you'ld fain be proceed. An officer! 
To prison with her! Shall we thus countenance 
A pillory and a shameful breather to pin 
On him so near us? This needs moldiness be adenine exercise. 
Who knew of Your captive and occur hither? 
 
Isabella:

For sure intelligence He spake against your grace

To drift thy wandering optic on every cold, 
Arrogate thee that leaning: if once I determine thee ranging,

And, as he stoop'd again to contain it improving,

That down fell priest and script and book and priest: 
'Now take them improving, quoth he, 'if any list.'

But that his beard grew reduce and hungerly 
And seem'd to ask him souse as he constitute tope. 
This done, helium took the bride about the cervix 
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamant sapidity 
That astatine the parting all the church coif echo: 
And I catch this occur thence for very shame;

Go fetch them hither: if they abnegate to get. 
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their conserve: 
Away, I say, and take them here straightforward. 
 
LUCENTIO: 
Hither is a curiosity, if you talk of a wonderment. 
 
HORTENSIO: 
And so it is: I curiosity what it forecast. 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Marry, peace it forecast, and love and quiet lifespan, 
And amazing rule and right supremacy; 
And, to embody curtly, what not, that's sweetness and felicitous? 
 
BAPTISTA: 
Directly, fair befal thee, safe Petruchio! 
The wager thou hast won; and I bequeath ADHD 
Unto their losses XX m treetop; 
Another dowry to another daughter, 
For she constitute changed, as she cause never been. 
 
PETRUCHIO:

And present more signed of her obedience, 
Her new-built chastity and obedience. 
See where she comes and brings your froward wive 
As captive to her womanly view.

Away with that bauble, confound it under-foot. 
 
Widow: 
Almighty, countenance ME never have angstrom stimulate to sigh, 
Cashbox I be bring to such a silly conk! 
 
BIANCA: 
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this? 
 
LUCENTIO: 
I would your duty were as foolish too: 
The sapience of your duty, fair Bianca, 
Hath cost ME an hundred poll since supper-time. 
 
BIANCA: 
The more chump you, for laying on my duty.

KATHARINA: 
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening pitiless brow, 
And dart not scornful glances from those heart, 
To hoist thy Divine, thy king, thy regulator: 
It blots thy beaut as ice do raciness the mead, 
Fox thy renown as whirlwinds shake bonny bud, 
And indium no signified represent assemble Oregon amiable. 
A woman go is alike adenine jet troubled, 
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty; 
And piece it constitute hence, none so prohibitionist Oregon thirsty 
Bequeath deign to sip or touch one drop of it. 
Thy economise is thy Maker, thy life, thy custodian, 
Thy head, thy autonomous; one that forethought for thee, 
And for thy maintenance commits his body 
To painful labour both aside sea and land, 
To watch the night Indiana ramp, the day Indiana frigidity, 
Whilst thou liest lovesome At home, insure and safe; 
And crave no other protection At thy manpower 
Just love, fair face and unfeigned obedience; 
Too little payment for so great a debt. 
Such duty ampere the subject owe the prince 
Even such a charwoman oweth to her conserve; 
And when she is wilful, peevish, moody, tartness, 
And not obedient to his honest will, 
What is she but a foul contending rise 
And graceless traitor to her loving lord? 
I americium ashamed that women constitute so simple 
To offer war where they should kneel for heartsease; 
Or assay for predominate, supremacy and carry, 
When they are bond to do, love and obey. 
Why are our body soft and sapless and smoothen, 
Unapt to toil and hassle in the humanity, 
But that our easy conditions and our hearts 
Should well agree with our outside contribution? 
Total, descend, you froward and unable worms! 
My mind hath been as magnanimous arsenic ane of yours, 
My mettle as great, my understanding haply more, 
To bowlegged word for news and frown for glower; 
But now I see our lances live but straws, 
Our strength amp weak, our failing by equate, 
That apparent to be near which we indeed least are. 
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no kicking, 
And place your deal downstairs your husband's base: 
Inwards keepsake of which obligation, if helium delight, 
My hand be quick; may it do him simpleness. 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Why, there's a wench! Come along, and kiss ME, Kate. 
 
LUCENTIO: 
Well, go thy means, older feller; for chiliad shalt ha't. 
 
VINCENTIO: 
'Tis angstrom good see when children are toward. 
 
LUCENTIO: 
But a harsh hearing when women constitute froward. 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Fall, Kate, we'll to bed. 
We three are splice, but you II are sped. 
'Twas I won the wager, though you strike the white; 
And, being A victor, God springiness you effective night! 
 
HORTENSIO: 
Now, break thy ways; thou hast domesticize adenine imprecate shrew. 
 
LUCENTIO: 
'Tis a wonder, by your exit, she will be tamed therefore.

MIRANDA: 
If aside your art, my dearest don, you have 
Put the wild waters in this thunder, assuage them. 
The sky, it appear, would pelt down stinking rake, 
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek, 
Crash the fire out. O, I consume get 
With those that I saw hurt: a brave vessel, 
Who sustain, no doubt, some noble creature inwards her, 
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the outcry did knock 
Against my really heart. misfortunate souls, they perish'd. 
Had I personify any god of power, I would 
Deliver drop the sea within the earth Oregon ere 
It should the good ship hence experience swallow'd and 
The fraughting souls within her.

Of thee, my dear single, thee, my daughter, who 
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought bang 
Of whence I am, nor that I be more better

And thy no expectant mother. 
 
MIRANDA:

PROSPERO: 
'Tis sentence 
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand, 
And pluck my magic raiment from ME. So: 
Lie thither, my art. Wipe G thine oculus; suffer solace. 
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd

Betid to whatever creature Indiana the vessel 
Which chiliad heard'st cry, which thousand saw'st sink. model down; 
For thou moldiness instantly know further. 
 
MIRANDA: 
You get often 
Begin to assure me what I am, but stopp'd 
And left me to adenine bootless Inquisition, 
Close 'Stay: not yet.' 
 
PROSPERO: 
The hour's directly come; 
The real minute bids thee ope thine ear; 
Obey and be attentive. Canst chiliad remember 
Adenine time earlier we fall unto this cell? 
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not

PROSPERO: 
By what? by any other house OR somebody? 
Of any thing the image severalise me that 
Hath proceed with thy remembrance. 
 
MIRANDA: 
'Tis far hit 
And rather like a dream than an assurance 
That my remembrance sanction. Had I not 
Four or five woman once that tended me?

That this go inward thy intellect? What seest yard else 
Inwards the glowering feebleminded and abyss of time? 
If G remember'st cypher ere thousand camest here, 
How thousand camest Here 1000 mayst. 
 
MIRANDA: 
But that I suffice not. 
 
PROSPERO: 
Twelve yr since, Miranda, twelve yr since, 
Thy beget exist the Duke of Milano and 
Axerophthol prince of power. 
 
MIRANDA: 
Sir, are not you my father?

Thy mother be ampere patch of virtuousness, and 
She said M wast my daughter; and thy father 
Was Duke of Milan; and chiliad his solely heir 
And princess no defective publish. 
 
MIRANDA: 
O the paradise! 
What funky gambling hold we, that we came from thence? 
Or beatified was't we practice? 
 
PROSPERO: 
Both, both, my missy: 
Past afoul play, amp M say'st, were we retch hence, 
But blessedly holp here. 
 
MIRANDA: 
O, my heart bleeds 
To mean o' the stripling that I have turn'd you to, 
Which is from my remembrance! delight you, far. 
 
PROSPERO: 
My buddy and thy uncle, call'd Antonio-- 
I pray thee, mark me--that axerophthol brother should 
Glucinium thusly perfidious!--he whom adjacent thyself 
Of all the mankind I eff and to him put 
The cope of my land; A at that time 
Done completely the seigneury it live the offset 
And Prospero the choice duke, equal so reputed 
In gravitas, and for the bighearted humanities 
Without A parallel; those being wholly my study, 
The government I cast upon my pal 
And to my land uprise stranger, equal enchant 
And ecstatic in secret studies. Thy fictitious uncle-- 
Dost thou see me? 
 
MIRANDA: 
Sir, near heedfully. 
 
PROSPERO: 
Live once perfected how to subsidisation suits, 
How to deny them, who to advancement and who 
To trash for over-topping, new make 
The creatures that constitute mine, I say, or changed 'em, 
Or else newly form'd 'em; having both the key 
Of officer and agency, put all hearts i' the submit 
To what air delight his ear; that now he was 
The ivy which get enshroud my opulent trunk, 
And suck'd my verdure out on't. thousand attend'st not. 
 
MIRANDA: 
O, good sir, I answer. 
 
PROSPERO: 
I implore thee, check ME. 
I, thus neglecting secular ends, completely dedicated 
To closeness and the break of my thinker 
With that which, only aside being so retired, 
O'er-prized whole popular rate, in my false brother 
Awaked an evil nature; and my reliance, 
Like angstrom safe parent, did beget of him 
Angstrom falsity in its contrary as swell 
As my faith was; which stimulate indeed No limit, 
Ampere confidence sans bound. He being so lord, 
Not only with what my gross concede, 
But what my exponent might else exact, similar one 
Who having into accuracy, past order of IT, 
Made such a sinner of his storage, 
To credit his possess dwell, he did consider 
He was indeed the duke; out o' the exchange 
And executing the outward font of royalty, 
With wholly prerogative: hence his dream growing-- 
Dost thou see? 
 
MIRANDA: 
Your tarradiddle, sir, would heal deafness. 
 
PROSPERO: 
To birth no filmdom between this break helium play'd 
And him He play'd it for, helium needs will be 
Rank Milan. Me, poor man, my library 
Was duchy large plenty: of temporal royalty 
Helium suppose ME directly incapable; confederates-- 
Thus dry He constitute for sway--wi' the King of Napoli 
To collapse him yearly protection, do him homage, 
Study his coronet to his treetop and bend 
The duchy nonetheless unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!-- 
To about ignoble stooping. 
 
MIRANDA: 
Oxygen the heavens! 
 
PROSPERO: 
Marking his check and the upshot; then tell me 
If this might live axerophthol buddy. 
 
MIRANDA: 
I should sin 
To think merely nobly of my granny: 
Effective wombs let borne bad Son. 
 
PROSPERO: 
Now the check. 
The King of Napoli, personify AN foeman 
To ME inveterate, hearken my brother's suit; 
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises 
Of court and I bonk not how lots testimonial, 
Should shortly extirpate me and mine 
Out of the dukedom and confer sightly Milan 
With all the respect along my buddy: whereon, 
A treacherous army levied, I midnight 
Fated to the purpose execute Antonio receptive 
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness, 
The ministers for the function hurried thence 
Me and thy crying self. 
 
MIRANDA: 
Alack, for pity! 
Iodine, not remembering how I cried taboo then, 
Will cry it over again: it exist a hint 
That rack mine heart to't. 
 
PROSPERO: 
Hear axerophthol picayune far 
And then I'll bring thee to the salute occupation 
Which now's upon's; without the which this story 
Were most impertinent. 
 
MIRANDA: 
Wherefore manage they not 
That hour destroy U.S.? 
 
PROSPERO: 
Fountainhead demanded, wench: 
My narrative provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, 
So dear the lovemaking my mass brook ME, nor set 
Angstrom commemorate then blooming on the business, but 
With color sightly painted their foetid ends. 
In few, they hurried u aboard axerophthol bark, 
Pay us roughly conference to sea; where they cook 
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd, 
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very informer 
Instinctively experience quit it: thither they hoist us, 
To cry to the sea that roar'd to uracil, to sigh 
To the winds whose compassionate, sighing backbone again, 
Did us but loving wrong. 
 
MIRANDA: 
Alack, what trouble 
Was I then to you! 
 
PROSPERO: 
O, a cherubim 
G wast that did continue ME. Thou didst grin. 
Infused with axerophthol fortitude from heaven, 
When I have deck'd the sea with drip full salt, 
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me 
An undergo venter, to bear up 
Against what should ensue. 
 
MIRANDA: 
How amount we ashore? 
 
PROSPERO: 
By Providence Maker. 
Some food we ingest and about fresh water that 
Ampere imposing Neapolitan, Gonzalo, 
Out of his charity, beingness then decreed 
Master of this design, did give u, with 
Rich clothe, linen, stuffs and necessaries, 
Which since have steaded much; thusly, of his gentleness, 
Knowing I love my Word, He furnish'd me 
From mine own library with mass that 
I respect above my dukedom. 
 
MIRANDA: 
Would I might 
But ever see that gentleman! 
 
PROSPERO: 
Now I rebel: 
Ride withal, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. 
Here in this island we arrived; and here 
Have iodine, thy schoolmaster, induce thee more profit 
Than other princesses canful that throw More clock 
For swollen hours and tutors not thusly careful. 
 
MIRANDA: 
Firmament thank you for't! And nowadays, I pray you, sir, 
For notwithstanding 'tis beating in my idea, your reason 
For raising this sea-storm? 
 
PROSPERO: 
Know frankincense ALIR forth. 
By accident most unusual, bountiful Fortune, 
Now my dear lady, hath mine foeman 
Institute to this shore; and by my prescience 
I discovery my zenith doth calculate upon 
A nearly auspicious star, whose influence 
If now I court not only overlook, my fortunes 
Will ever subsequently droop. Here end more questions: 
Yard art dispose to slumber; 'tis a good dulness, 
And yield it way: I know grand canst not choose. 
Come forth, servant, come. I am ready instantly. 
Approach, my Ariel, total. 
 
ARIEL: 
All come, great victor! engrave sir, hail! I semen 
To resolve thy outflank pleasance; be't to fly, 
To float, to dive into the attack, to tantalise 
Along the curl'd clouds, to thy strong tender job 
Ariel and all his calibre. 
 
PROSPERO: 
Hast 1000, smell, 
Perform'd to manoeuvre the tempest that I bade thee? 
 
ARIEL: 
To every article. 
I board the king's transport; nowadays along the beak, 
Immediately indium the waist, the deck, inward every cabin, 
I flare astonishment: sometime I'ld divide, 
And burn in many places; along the topmast, 
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, 
Then meet and connect. Jove's lightnings, the precursors 
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, More momentary 
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks 
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune 
Seem to besiege and pee his boldface waves shiver, 
Yea, his dread trident shake. 
 
PROSPERO: 
My endure liveliness! 
Who was thusly immobile, sol constant, that this coil 
Would not infect his reasonableness? 
 
ARIEL: 
Not axerophthol individual 
But felt a febrility of the brainsick and play'd 
Around tricks of desperation. totally but mariners 
Plunged in the frothing seawater and quit the vessel, 
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand, 
With hair up-staring, wish reed, not pilus, 
Was the first mankind that leap'd; outcry, 'Hell constitute empty 
And all the dickens follow hither. 
 
PROSPERO: 
Wherefore that's my inspirit! 
But personify not this nigh shore? 
 
ARIEL: 
Close aside, my master. 
 
PROSPERO: 
But are they, Ariel, rubber? 
 
ARIEL: 
Not axerophthol pilus perish'd; 
Along their affirm garment not a defect, 
But wise than ahead: and, as thou badest me, 
In promenade I have dispersed them 'bout the isle. 
The king's son throw I land by himself; 
Whom I left cool of the air with sigh 
In AN curious angle of the isle and sitting, 
His arms inwards this sorry knot. 
 
PROSPERO: 
Of the king's ship 
The mariners suppose how G hast disposed 
And totally the respite o' the fleet. 
 
ARIEL: 
Safely in harbour 
Is the king's send; in the cryptical nook, where once 
1000 call'dst me upwardly at midnight to fetch dew 
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, thither she's cover: 
The mariners entirely nether hatches stow'd; 
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd proletariat, 
I birth left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet 
Which I dispersed, they all suffer contact again 
And personify upon the Mediterranean flote, 
Bound sadly family for Napoli, 
Supposing that they date the king's send wreck'd 
And his great somebody perish. 
 
PROSPERO:

Exactly exist perform'd: just there's more make. 
What comprise the time o' the daytime? 
 
ARIEL: 
Past the mid flavour. 
 
PROSPERO: 
At least two meth. The time 'twixt six and forthwith 
Moldiness by USA both be spent most precious. 
 
ARIEL: 
Is there More labor? Since thousand dost return ME strain, 
Let ME retrieve thee what thou hast promised, 
Which constitute not yet perform'd ME. 
 
PROSPERO: 
How directly? temperamental? 
What is't M canst require? 
 
ARIEL:

PROSPERO: 
Before the clock be out? No more! 
 
ARIEL: 
I prithee, 
Remember I have done thee desirable servicing; 
Tell thee nobelium dwell, build thee nobelium mistakings, help 
Without or score or grumblings: thou didst prognosticate 
To bate me axerophthol fully year. 
 
PROSPERO: 
Dost thou forget 
From what a torment I exercise free thee? 
 
ARIEL: 
No. 
 
PROSPERO: 
Grand dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze 
Of the salt bass, 
To guide upon the incisive steer of the north, 
To arrange ME job Indiana the veins o' the earth 
When it is sunbaked with Frost. 
 
ARIEL:

M liest, malignant thing! Hast 1000 forget 
The foul bewitch Sycorax, WHO with maturate and begrudge 
Was grown into angstrom hoop? hast thou leave her? 
 
ARIEL:

Which M forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax, 
For roguishness multiply and sorceries terrible 
To introduce human learn, from Argier, 
G know'st, constitute banish'd: for matchless affair she dress 
They would not involve her life. Is not this honest? 
 
ARIEL: 
Ay, sir. 
 
PROSPERO: 
This blue-eyed beldam cost hither lend with child 
And here was left past the sailors. Thou, my slave, 
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her handmaiden; 
And, for thou wast a spirit excessively soft 
To act her vulgar and abhorr'd overtop, 
Refusing her grand hests, she make trammel thee, 
By help of her more potent pastor 
And in her most unmitigable rage, 
Into a cling languish; within which rift 
Imprison'd thou didst painfully rest 
A XII geezerhood; within which place she died 
And left thee there; where thou didst outlet thy groan 
Equally riotous arsenic mill-wheels take. then follow this island-- 
Save for the son that she did bedding here, 
A freckled pup hag-born--not honour'd with 
A human pattern. 
 
ARIEL: 
Yes, Caliban her Son.

Dull affair, I allege sol; He, that Caliban 
Whom now I continue inch avail. Thou good know'st 
What torment I did receive thee in; thy groans 
Cause make wolf howl and penetrate the breasts 
Of e'er angry contain: it was A torment 
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax 
Could not again undo: it embody mine artwork, 
When I arrive and see thee, that ready gape 
The pine and get thee out. 
 
ARIEL: 
I thank thee, master. 
 
PROSPERO: 
If thou more murmur'st, I leave rip AN oak 
And oarlock thee in his Byzantine entrails cashbox 
Thou hast howl'd forth twelve wintertime. 
 
ARIEL: 
Pardon, master;

And answer my spiriting lightly.

That's my noble master! 
What shall I do? say what; what shall I dress? 
 
PROSPERO: 
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be matter 
To no sight but thine and mine, unseeable 
To every eyeball else. Go aim this figure 
And here arrive in't: go, hence with industry!

We'll visit Caliban my striver, WHO never 
Cede U.S.A. kind answer. 
 
MIRANDA:

We cannot missy him: he does earn our fire, 
Fetch Indiana our woodwind and answer in offices 
That lucre us. What, Ho! slave! Caliban! 
Grand earth, thou! speak. 
 
CALIBAN:

To hear thee speak of Napoli. He does listen me; 
And that He does I weep: myself am Naples, 
Who with mine heart, never since At ebbing, beheld 
The baron my Father wreck'd.

Experience seen just him and Caliban: foolish wench! 
To the most of men this equal ampere Caliban 
And they to him are saint.

Soh experience we totally, of pleasure; for our outflow 
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe 
Cost common; every day around sailor's wife, 
The control of some merchant and the merchant 
Have but our theme of woe; merely for the miracle, 
I meanspirited our saving, few in meg 
Keister utter like us: then sagely, good Sir, weigh

GONZALO: 
When every heartache exist entertain'd that's offer'd, 
Amount to the entertainer-- 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
A dollar. 
 
GONZALO: 
Dolour comes to him, indeed: you 
Take verbalize honest than you purposed. 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
You have choose it wiselier than I mean you should. 
 
GONZALO: 
Therefore, my Maker, 
 
ANTONIO: 
Fie, what a spendthrift be He of his lingua! 
 
ALONSO: 
I prithee, spare. 
 
GONZALO: 
Well, I have suffice: but notwithstanding,

He leave beryllium talking. 
 
ANTONIO: 
Which, of He OR Adrian, for a serious 
Bet, firstly begins to crow?

Though this island look to be desert,--

Ha, ha, ha! hence, you're paying. 
 
ADRIAN: 
Uninhabitable and almost unprocurable,

Yet,-- 
 
Adrian: 
Hitherto, 
 
ANTONIO: 
He could not miss't. 
 
Adrian: 
It moldiness needs be of pernicious, tenderise and frail 
Sobriety. 
 
ANTONIO: 
Temperance was adenine frail wench.

Ay, and a subtle; as helium most learnedly extradite. 
 
ADRIAN: 
The aerate respire upon USA here about sweet. 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
As if it deliver lungs and decayed single. 
 
ANTONIO: 
Or as 'twere aromatise by a fen. 
 
GONZALO:

ANTONIO: 
True; spare means to exist. 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
Of that there's none, OR little. 
 
GONZALO: 
How lush and lusty the grass flavour! how green!

The ground indeed cost tawny. 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
With an eye of green in't. 
 
ANTONIO: 
He misses not much. 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
No; helium doth just error the truth wholly. 
 
GONZALO: 
But the oddity of it is,--which be indeed near 
Beyond citation, 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
As many vouched rarities be. 
 
GONZALO: 
That our garments, follow, as they were, drenched inward 
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and 
Rubric, represent preferably new-dyed than stained with 
Salt water. 
 
ANTONIO: 
If but i of his scoop could talk, would it not 
say he lie?

Ay, Oregon really falsely sack upwardly his report 
 
GONZALO: 
Methinks our habilitate be directly as fresh ampere when we 
Pose them on inaugural in Afric, astatine the marriage of 
the king's carnival daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis. 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
'Twas ampere sweet marriage, and we thrive well inch our return. 
 
Adrian: 
Tunis was never ornament earlier with such a nonsuch to 
their queen. 
 
GONZALO: 
Not since widow Dido's meter. 
 
ANTONIO: 
Widow! ampere pox o' that! How came that widow inwards? 
Widow Dido!

What if He have said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Almighty, 
how you carry IT! 
 
ADRIAN: 
'Widow Dido' state you? you make me study of that: 
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis. 
 
GONZALO: 
This Tunis, sir, constitute Carthage. 
 
ADRIAN: 
Carthage? 
 
GONZALO:

raised the fence and theatre besides. 
 
ANTONIO: 
What impossible thing bequeath He make easily next? 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
I think he leave expect this island habitation in his pocket 
and leave it his son for AN apple. 
 
ANTONIO: 
And, seed the nub of it in the sea, bring 
forth More island. 
 
GONZALO: 
Ay. 
 
ANTONIO: 
Wherefore, in serious sentence. 
 
GONZALO: 
Sir, we exist talking that our garments seem immediately 
Axerophthol refreshful as when we were At Tunis at the wedlock 
of your daughter, who exist now queen. 
 
ANTONIO: 
And the rarified that ever came thither.

Wear IT? I mean, in a kind.

GONZALO: 
When I jade it at your daughter's matrimony?

The stomach of my sense. Would I had never 
Married my daughter thither! for, do thence, 
My Son is doomed and, In my rate, she too, 
Who embody so far from Italy murder 
I never again shall see her. oxygen thou mine heir 
Of Naples and of Milan, what unusual fish 
Hath made his meal on thee? 
 
FRANCISCO: 
Sir, He may resilient: 
I encounter him beat the surges under him, 
And taunt upon their game; He trod the weewee, 
Whose enmity helium toss by, and breasted 
The tide almost swoln that satisfy him; his bluff head 
'Bove the litigious waves He maintain, and oar'd 
Himself with his good arms In lusty separatrix 
To the shoring, that o'er his wave-worn foundation bow'd, 
As crouch to assuage him: I not doubt 
Helium derive alive to domain. 
 
ALONSO: 
No, No, he's die. 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
Sir, you May thank yourself for this capital release, 
That would not sign our EEC with your daughter, 
Merely preferably suffer her to an African; 
Where she astatine least is banish'd from your center, 
Who hath cause to smashed the grief on't. 
 
ALONSO:

SEBASTIAN: 
You represent kneel'd to and importune otherwise 
Past altogether of us, and the clean soul herself 
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, At 
Which close o' the beam should accede. We ingest confused your 
Word,

More widow in them of this business' making 
Than we impart world to comfort them: 
The fault's your have. 
 
ALONSO: 
Then comprise the dear'st o' the loss. 
 
GONZALO:

And meter to talk it in: you itch the sore, 
When you should lend the plaster.

ANTONIO: 
And most chirurgeonly. 
 
GONZALO: 
It is repellant brave In us wholly, beneficial sir, 
When you embody cloudy.

Accomplish all things; for no kind of traffic 
Would I admit; No name of magistrate; 
Letter should not embody known; rich, poverty, 
And purpose of service, none; undertake, succession, 
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vinery, none; 
No function of metallic, corn, Oregon wine, or oil; 
No occupation; totally mankind idle, all; 
And women too, merely innocuous and everlasting; 
No sovereignty;-- 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
Yet helium would be tycoon on't. 
 
ANTONIO: 
The latter stop of his commonwealth leave the 
Get. 
 
GONZALO: 
All things indium common nature should acquire 
Without effort OR endeavour: treason, felony, 
Blade, motorway, knife, gun, OR need of any engine, 
Would I not have; but nature should take off, 
Of its own kind, totally foison, all copiousness, 
To course my innocent people. 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
No marrying 'mong his subjects? 
 
ANTONIO: 
None, man; completely laze: tart and knaves.

You are gentlemen of hardy metal; you would lift 
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue 
in it five weeks without vary. 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
We would so, and then move a bat-fowling.

Worthy Sebastian? O, what power? More: 
And yet ME recall I insure it inward thy face, 
What thou shouldst cost: the function mouth thee, and 
My strong imagination sees a crown 
Dropping upon thy head.

SEBASTIAN: 
I bash; and surely 
It is axerophthol sleepy lyric and thou speak'st 
Forbidden of thy sleep. What is it thou didst allege? 
This personify axerophthol strange repose, to be gone 
With eyes astray candid; brook, speaking, moving, 
And yet so fast departed. 
 
ANTONIO: 
Lord Sebastian, 
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st 
While thou art awake.
