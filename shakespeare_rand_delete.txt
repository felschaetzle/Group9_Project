First Citizen:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
 
All: 
speak. 

First Citizen:
You are all rather to die to famish? 
 
All:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
First, you Caius Marcius is enemy to the people. 

All:
We we know't. 

First Citizen:
us kill him, and we'll corn at our own price. 
Is't a verdict? 

All:
No talking on't; it be done: away! 

Second Citizen:
One word, good citizens. 

First Citizen: 
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
What authority on would relieve us: if they 
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we guess they relieved us humanely; 
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance; our
sufferance is a to them Let us revenge 
our pikes, ere become rakes: the gods know I 
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

Second Citizen:
Would you proceed especially against Caius 
 
All: 
Against him a dog the commonalty. 

Second Citizen: 
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
 
First Citizen:
Very well; and could be content to give him good
report fort, but that pays himself with proud. 
 
Second Citizen:
Nay, speak not maliciously. 
 
First Citizen: 
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can 
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his and to partly which he 
is, even till altitude his virtue. 
 
Second Citizen:
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
in him. You must in no way say he is covetous. 

First Citizen:
If I must I barren 
faults, with surplus, tire in repetition. 
What shouts are these? The other side the 
risen: stay prating to the Capitol! 

All:
Come, come.
 
First 
Soft! who comes here?

Second Citizen: 
Worthy Menenius one that always loved 
the people. 

First Citizen: 
He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
 
MENENIUS: 
What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.

First Citizen:
Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend do, 
which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
have strong arms too.

MENENIUS: 
Why, masters, my good friends, mine neighbours, 
Will you undo yourselves? 
 
First Citizen:
We cannot, sir, we are undone already.

MENENIUS: 
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Have the patricians of you. For your wants, 
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against Roman state, whose course will on 
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment. For dearth, 
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack, 
are transported by calamity 
where more attends you, and you 
The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers, 
When you curse them as enemies.

First Citizen:
for True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us 
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
support repeal daily any act 
established against the rich, and provide more
piercing to chain up restrain 
the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
there's all the love they bear us. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Either you must 
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious, 
Or accused tell you 
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
To stale 't a little more.

First Citizen:
Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think 
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
you, deliver.
 

There time all the body's members 
Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
only like a gulf it did remain 
I' the o' the body, idle and unactive, 
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments 
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
And, mutually participate, did minister
Unto the appetite and affection common 
Of the whole The belly answer'd-- 

First Citizen: 
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?

MENENIUS:
Sir, I shall tell you. With a of smile, 
Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
For, look you, I may make the belly smile 
well as speak--it replied 
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
envied receipt; even so most fitly 
you malign senators that 
They are not such as you.

First Citizen: 
Your answer? What! 
The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
Our steed the leg, the tongue our 
With other and petty helps 
In this our fabric, if that they-- 
 
MENENIUS:
What then? 
'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?

First Citizen: 
Should by cormorant belly be restrain'd, 
Who is the sink o' the body,--


Well, what then?
 
First Citizen: 
The former agents, if they did complain,
could the answer? 

MENENIUS: 
I will you 
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's 
 
First Citizen: 
Ye're long about it.

MENENIUS:
Note me this, 
Your most grave belly was 
Not rash accusers, and thus answer'd: 
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
'That I receive the general food at first, 
you live upon; fit it is, 
am the store-house and the shop 
Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
I send it the rivers blood, 
Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
cranks and offices of man, 
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive that natural competency
Whereby live: and though that all at once, 
You, good friends,'--this says the mark me,-- 
 
First Citizen:
Ay, sir; well, 

MENENIUS: 
'Though all at once cannot
See what I do deliver out to each,
Yet I can make my audit up, that all
From do back receive flour all, 
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?

First Citizen:
It was an answer: how apply you this?

MENENIUS:
The senators of Rome are this good belly,
And you the mutinous members; for examine
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
weal o' the common, you shall find 
No public benefit which you receive
But proceeds or comes from them to you 
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
You, the great toe of this assembly? 
 
First Citizen:
I the great toe! why the great toe?

MENENIUS:
For that, being the lowest, basest, poorest, 
Of this most thou go'st foremost: 
Thou rascal, art worst in blood to run, 
Lead'st first to win some vantage.
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
Rome her rats are at the point of battle; 
The one side must have bale.
Hail, noble Marcius!

MARCIUS: 
Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Make yourselves scabs? 
 
Citizen: 
We have ever your good word.
 
MARCIUS:
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you, 
The other makes you proud. that trusts to 
Where he should you lions, finds you hares; 
geese: are no surer, no, 
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
To make worthy subdues him 
And curse that justice did it.
Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate; and your affections are
A sick man's appetite, desires most 
Which would increase his evil. He that 
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead 
And hews oaks with rushes. ye! Ye? 
With every minute you do change a mind,
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble senate, 
Under the gods, you in awe, else 
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
 
MENENIUS: 
For corn at their own rates; say, 
The city is well 
 
MARCIUS:
Hang 'em! They say! 
by the fire, and presume to know 
What's done i' the who's to rise, 
Who thrives and who declines; side factions
and give out
marriages; making parties strong 
And feebling such as stand in their liking 
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
grain enough! 
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
And let me use my I'll make a quarry 
With thousands of these quarter'd as high 
As I could pick my lance.

MENENIUS:
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
For though abundantly they lack 
Yet are they passing cowardly. But, you, 
What says the other troop?

MARCIUS:
They are dissolved: hang 'em!
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd proverbs, 
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs 
That was made for mouths, that the gods sent not 
Corn for rich men only: with these shreds 
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd, 
And a petition granted them, a strange one--
To break the of generosity, 
And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
Shouting their emulation.

MENENIUS:
What is granted them?

MARCIUS:
tribunes to defend their wisdoms, 
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
rabble should have first unroof'd the city, 
so prevail'd with me: it will in time 
Win upon and throw forth 
For arguing. 

MENENIUS:
This is strange.

MARCIUS:
Go, get you home, you fragments! 
 
Messenger: 
Caius 

MARCIUS:
Here: what's the matter? 


The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
 
MARCIUS:
I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.

First Senator:
Marcius, 'tis that have told 
The Volsces are in 

MARCIUS:
They have a leader,
Aufidius, will put you 't. 
I his nobility, 
And were I any thing but what I am,
I would wish me only he.
 
COMINIUS:
You have fought together.
 
MARCIUS: 
Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
Upon party, I'ld revolt to make 
Only my wars with him: he a lion 
That I am proud to hunt.
 
First Senator: 
Then, worthy Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars. 

COMINIUS: 
It is former 

MARCIUS:
Sir, it is;
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see once more strike at Tullus' 
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
 
TITUS: 
No, Caius Marcius; 
one fight with t'other, 
stay this 

MENENIUS:
O, true-bred!

First Senator:
Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
Our greatest friends attend us. 



COMINIUS:
Marcius! 
 
Senator: 

MARCIUS:
Nay, let them follow:
The Volsces corn; these rats thither 
To gnaw their Worshipful mutiners, 
Your valour puts pray, follow. 
 
SICINIUS:
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

BRUTUS: 
He has no equal.
 
SICINIUS: 
When were chosen tribunes for the people,-- 
 
BRUTUS: 
Mark'd you lip and eyes? 
 

Nay. his taunts. 

BRUTUS:
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
 
SICINIUS: 
Be-mock the modest moon.
 
BRUTUS:
The present wars devour him: he is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.
 
SICINIUS: 
Such a nature, 
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
insolence can brook be commanded 
Under Cominius.
 
BRUTUS:
Fame, at the which he aims,
In whom already he's well graced, can not
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first: for what miscarries
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure 
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Had borne the business!'

SICINIUS:
Besides, if things go well,
that so sticks on Marcius shall 
Of his demerits rob Cominius.

BRUTUS: 
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours are to 
Though Marcius earned them not, and all faults 
To Marcius be honours, though 
In aught he merit not.

SICINIUS:
Let's and hear 
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this present action.
 
BRUTUS: 
Lets along.

First Senator: 
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
they of Rome are entered in our counsels 
And know how we proceed.

AUFIDIUS: 
Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state,
That could be brought to bodily act ere 
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
have the letter here; yes, here it is. 
'They have a power, but it is not known 
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
The people mutinous; and is rumour'd, 
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
And Titus a most 
These three lead on this preparation
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Consider of it.'

First Senator:
Our army's in the field
never yet made doubt but ready 
To answer us.

AUFIDIUS:
Nor did think it folly 
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when 
They needs must show themselves; which
in the hatching, 
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot.


Noble Aufidius,
Take your hie you to your 
Let us alone to guard Corioli: 
If they set down before 's, for the remove
Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find 
They've not prepared for us. 

AUFIDIUS:
O, doubt not that;
I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
And hitherward. I leave your 
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

All:
The gods assist you!

AUFIDIUS: 
And keep your honours 

First Senator: 
Farewell.

Second Senator:
Farewell.
 

Farewell.
 
VOLUMNIA: 
I pray you, sing; or in a 
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
a day of a mother not 
him an hour from her I, considering 
how honour would become such a person. that it was 
no better than picture-like to hang wall, if 
renown made it not stir, was to him 
danger where was like to find fame. To a cruel 
war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
more in joy first hearing was man-child 
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.

VIRGILIA: 
But had died in the business, how then? 

VOLUMNIA: 
Then good should have my son; I 
therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
alike and none less dear than thine and my good
Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

Gentlewoman:
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
 
VIRGILIA:
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Indeed, you shall not.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's 
See him Aufidius down by the hair, 
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
Methinks I him stamp thus, and call 
'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
all or lose his hire. 

VIRGILIA:
His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!

VOLUMNIA: 
Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba, 
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
Than Hector's forehead when forth blood 
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
We are fit to bid her welcome.

VIRGILIA:
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

VOLUMNIA:
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
And his 
 
VALERIA: 
My ladies both, good day to you. 
 

Sweet madam. 

VIRGILIA:
I am glad to ladyship. 

VALERIA:
How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
What you sewing here? A spot, in good 
faith. How does your little son?
 
VIRGILIA: 
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

VOLUMNIA:
He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
look upon his school-master. 
 

O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
Wednesday half an hour together: has such a 
confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
butterfly: and when he caught he let it 
again; after it again; and over he 
comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his 
teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
it!
 
VOLUMNIA:
One on 's father's moods.

VALERIA:
Indeed, 'tis a child. 
 
VIRGILIA: 
A crack, madam.

VALERIA:
Come, aside your stitchery; I must you play 
idle husewife with 

VIRGILIA: 
No, good madam; I will not out of doors. 
 

Not out of doors! 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
She shall, she shall. 
 
VIRGILIA: 
Indeed, no, by your I'll not over the 
threshold till my return from the 


Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come, 
you must go visit the good that lies in. 
 
VIRGILIA:
I wish her speedy and her with 
my prayers; but I cannot go thither. 

VOLUMNIA: 
Why, I pray you? 

VIRGILIA: 
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

VALERIA: 
You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
were sensible as your finger, you leave 
pricking it for pity. Come, you shall with us. 

VIRGILIA:
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will forth. 
 
VALERIA:
In truth, la, go with me; I'll tell you 
excellent news of husband. 
 
VIRGILIA: 
good madam, there be none yet. 
 
VALERIA:
Verily, I do with you; there came news from 
him last night.
 
VIRGILIA: 
Indeed, madam? 
 
VALERIA: 
In earnest, true; I heard a senator speak it. 
Thus it the Volsces have an forth; against 
whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set 
their city they nothing doubt 
prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us. 

VIRGILIA:
Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
thing hereafter.

VOLUMNIA:
Let her alone, lady: she now, she but 
disease our better mirth.

VALERIA:
In troth, think she Fare you well, then. 
Come, good sweet Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy 
solemness out o' door. along us. 

VIRGILIA:
at word, madam; indeed, I not. I wish 
you much mirth. 

VALERIA:
Well, farewell. 
 
MARCIUS:
Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.

LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, no.


'Tis done.
 
LARTIUS: 
Agreed.

MARCIUS:
Say, has our general met the enemy?
 

They lie but have spoke as yet. 
 
LARTIUS:
So, the horse is mine. 
 
MARCIUS: 
I'll buy him 

LARTIUS:
No, sell give him: lend him will 
For half a hundred years. Summon the town.

MARCIUS: 
How far off lie armies? 

Messenger:
Within this mile and half.
 
MARCIUS:
Then shall hear their 'larum, and they ours. 
Now, I prithee, make us in work, 
That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
To help our fielded friends! blow 
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

First Senator:
nor a man that fears you than he, 
That's lesser than a little.
Hark! our drums
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
They'll open of themselves.
Hark you. far off!
There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
your cloven army. 
 
MARCIUS: 
O, they at it! 
 
LARTIUS:
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho! 

MARCIUS: 
They fear us not, but issue their city. 
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight 
With hearts more proof than Advance, 

do disdain much beyond our thoughts, 
Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
He that retires him for a Volsce, 
he shall feel mine edge. 
 
MARCIUS: 
All contagion of south light on you, 
You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
Further than seen and one infect another 
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
bear the shapes men, you 
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt backs red, and faces pale 
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
Or, the fires of heaven, I'll the foe 
And make my on you: look come on; 
If you'll stand beat them to their wives, 
As they us to 
So, now gates are now prove good seconds: 
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do like. 

First Soldier: 
Fool-hardiness; not 


Nor I. 

First Soldier:
they have shut him in. 
 
All:
To pot, I him. 
 
LARTIUS: 
What is become of Marcius?

All: 
Slain, sir, doubtless.

First 
Following the fliers at the very heels,
With them he enters; who, upon the sudden, 
Clapp'd to their gates: he himself alone, 
To answer all the city.

LARTIUS:
O noble fellow!
sensibly outdares his senseless sword, 
And, when up. art left, Marcius: 
A carbuncle big thou art, 
Were not rich a Thou wast a soldier 
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
in strokes; but, with thy looks 
The of thy sounds, 
Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
Were feverous and did tremble.
 
First Soldier: 
Look, sir. 

LARTIUS: 
O,'tis Marcius! 
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.

First Roman: 
This will carry Rome. 

Second Roman:
And I this.

Third Roman:
A murrain on't! took this for silver. 
 
MARCIUS: 
See here these movers that prize their 
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those wore them, these base slaves, 
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
is of my hate, Aufidius, 
our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take 
Convenient numbers to make good the city; 
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.

LARTIUS: 
Worthy thou bleed'st; 
exercise hath been too violent 
A second course of fight.

MARCIUS: 
Sir, praise me not;
My hath yet not warm'd me: you well: 
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
I will appear, and fight.
 

Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall in love with thee; and her great charms 
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
Prosperity be thy page! 

MARCIUS:
no less 
Than those she placeth highest! farewell. 

LARTIUS:
Thou worthiest 
Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
Call thither all the officers o' the town,
Where they shall know our mind: away!
 
COMINIUS:
Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
we are come off 
Like neither foolish in stands, 
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, 
We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
By and conveying gusts we heard 
The charges of our Ye Roman 
Lead their successes as we wish our own, 
That both our powers, with smiling
fronts encountering,
May give you thankful sacrifice. 
Thy news? 
 
Messenger:
The citizens of Corioli have issued,
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
And I came away. 
 
COMINIUS:
Though thou truth, 
Methinks thou speak'st not well.
How long is't since? 
 
Messenger: 
Above an hour, my lord.
 
COMINIUS: 
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
How thou a mile confound an hour, 
bring thy news so late? 
 
Messenger: 
Spies the Volsces 
Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
Three or four miles about, had I, sir, 
Half an hour brought my report. 

COMINIUS:
Who's yonder, 
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
seen him thus. 

MARCIUS:

COMINIUS: 
shepherd knows thunder a tabour 
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue 
From meaner man. 

MARCIUS: 
Come I too late?
 
COMINIUS: 
Ay, if come not in the blood of

MARCIUS:
O, let me clip ye

As merry as when our day done, 
And tapers burn'd to bedward!

How is it with Titus Lartius?

MARCIUS:
As a man about decrees: 
Condemning some death, and some to exile; 
Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To let slip at

If not, cease you are so? 

COMINIUS: 

We at disadvantage fought and did 
Retire to win our purpose.

MARCIUS:
How lies their battle? know you on which side
They have their trust? 

COMINIUS:
As I guess, Marcius,
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very of hope. 

MARCIUS:
I do beseech you,
By all the battles wherein we have fought,
By the blood we have together, by vows 
We have made to endure friends, that you directly
me against Aufidius and his 
And that you not the present, 
Filling the air with advanced and darts, 
this very hour. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Though I could wish
You a bath 
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your choice of those
That best aid your action. 
 
MARCIUS:

That most are willing. If such be here-- 
As it sin to doubt--that love this painting 
Wherein see me if any fear 
Lesser his person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs life 
And that his dearer than himself; 
Let alone, or so so minded, 
Wave thus, to express his disposition,
And follow Marcius.
O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which of you
But is four Volsces? none of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
thanks to must I select 
from all: the rest
Shall bear the business in some other fight,
cause be obey'd. Please you to march; 
And four shall quickly draw out my command,
Which are best inclined. 
 
COMINIUS:
March on, my fellows:
Make good this ostentation, and you shall
Divide in all with us.
 
LARTIUS:
So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
I have set them down. If I send, dispatch 
Those to aid: the rest serve 
a short holding: if lose the field, 
We cannot keep the town. 

Lieutenant: 
Fear not our care, sir.

LARTIUS: 
Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.

MARCIUS:
I'll with none thee; for I do thee 
Worse than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS:
We hate alike:
Afric owns a serpent I abhor 
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot. 
 
MARCIUS:
Let the budger die the other's 
And the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS: 
If I fly, Marcius,
Holloa like hare. 
 
MARCIUS: 
Within these three hours, Tullus, 
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls, 
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to the highest.
 
AUFIDIUS: 
thou 
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
Thou shouldst not me here. 
Officious, not valiant, you have shamed me 
In your condemned seconds. 

COMINIUS:
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's 
not thy deeds: but I'll report it 
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles, 
Where patricians shall attend and shrug, 
I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
tribunes, 
That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
Our Rome hath such 
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
Having fully dined before.
 
LARTIUS: 
O 
Here is the steed, we the caparison:
Hadst thou beheld--

MARCIUS:
Pray now, no more: my mother,
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
As you have done; that's what I can; induced
As you have been; that's for my country:
He that has but effected his good will
Hath overta'en mine act.

COMINIUS:
You shall not be
The grave of your Rome must know 
The value of her own: 'twere a concealment 
Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
To hide your and to silence that, 
Which, the and top of praises vouch'd, 
Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
sign you are, to reward 
What you have done--before army hear me. 

MARCIUS: 
I have some wounds upon me, and they smart 
To themselves remember'd. 
 
COMINIUS: 
Should they not, 
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
Whereof have good store, of all 
The treasure this field achieved and city, 
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the distribution, 
Your choice. 

MARCIUS:
I thank you, general;
But cannot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
And stand upon my common part with those
have beheld the doing. 
 
MARCIUS:
May these same instruments, which you profane,
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall 
field prove flatterers, let courts and cities 
Made all of false-faced soothing! 
When steel grows soft as the silk, 
Let him be made the wars! 
No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
bled, or some debile wretch.-- 
Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
You shout me forth
In hyperbolical; 
As if I loved my little should be dieted 
In praises sauced with lies.

COMINIUS:
Too modest are you;
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly: by your patience,
If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you, 
Like that means his proper harm, in manacles, 
Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
As to us, that Caius Marcius 
Wears war's garland: in token of the which, 
My noble steed, known to the camp, give him, 
With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
For what he did before Corioli, call him,
the applause and clamour of the host, 
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
addition nobly ever! 
 
All:
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
 
CORIOLANUS:
I will go wash;
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To your good 
To the fairness of my power.

COMINIUS: 
So, to our tent;
ere we do repose us, we will write 
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
best, with we may articulate, 
For their own good and ours.

LARTIUS:
I shall, my lord. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
The gods begin to mock me. I, that 
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
my lord 

COMINIUS:
'tis yours. What is't? 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I sometime lay here in Corioli 
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly: 
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was within my view,
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
To give my poor host freedom.
 
COMINIUS:
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
Be free as is the Deliver him, Titus. 

LARTIUS:
Marcius, his name?
 
CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
we no wine here? 

COMINIUS: 
Go we to our tent:
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
should be look'd come. 

AUFIDIUS:
The town is ta'en!

First Soldier:
'Twill be deliver'd back condition. 

AUFIDIUS: 
Condition!
I would were a for cannot, 
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition! 
What can a treaty 
I' that is at mercy? Five times, 
I have fought thee: often hast thou beat me, 
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
As often as we eat. By the elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not that in't it for where 
I thought to crush him in an equal force, 
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
wrath or craft may get him. 

First Soldier: 
He's the devil. 

AUFIDIUS: 
Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
With only suffering stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol, 
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up 
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
hate to Marcius: where I find were it 
At home, upon my brother's guard, there, 
Against the hospitable canon, would I
my in's heart. Go you to city; 
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.
 
First Soldier:
Will 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
am attended at the I pray you-- 
'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
How the that the pace of it 
I may spur on my 
 
Soldier: 
I shall, sir. 

MENENIUS:
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.

BRUTUS:
Good or 
 

Not according to the prayer of the people, for they 
love not Marcius. 

SICINIUS:
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, does the wolf love? 
 

The lamb. 

MENENIUS:
Ay, to devour as hungry plebeians would the 
noble Marcius.
 
BRUTUS:
He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.

MENENIUS: 
He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.

Both:
sir. 
 
MENENIUS:
In what enormity Marcius poor that you two 
have not in abundance?

BRUTUS:
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
 
SICINIUS: 
Especially in 

BRUTUS:
And topping all others in boasting. 

MENENIUS:
This is strange now: do you two know how you are 
censured here in the city, I mean of o' the 
right-hand file? do you?

Both:
Why, how we censured? 

MENENIUS:
Because you talk of pride now,--will you be angry? 

Both:
Well, well, sir, well.
 

'tis no matter; for a very little thief of 
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
give dispositions reins, and angry at 
your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
pleasure you in being You blame Marcius for 
being proud? 
 
BRUTUS: 
We do it not alone, sir.
 
MENENIUS:
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
single: your abilities are too infant-like for
doing much alone. You talk pride: O that you 
turn your toward the napes of your necks, 
and make but an interior survey your good selves! 
O that could! 

BRUTUS:
What then, sir? 

MENENIUS:
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
violent, testy magistrates, alias as 
any in Rome.

SICINIUS:
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
 
MENENIUS: 
I am known to humorous patrician, and one 
loves a cup of hot wine with a drop of allaying 
Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
upon too trivial that 
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
you me palate adversely, I make a 
crooked face it. can't say your worships have 
delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
compound with the major of your syllables: 
though I be bear with those that 
you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
well enough what barm can your bisson 
conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
well enough too? 

BRUTUS: 
sir, come, we know you well enough. 

MENENIUS:
You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps legs: you 
wear out a good forenoon in hearing a 
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller; 
and then controversy of three pence to a 
second day of audience. When you are hearing a
matter between party and party, if you chance to be 
pinched with the colic, you make faces like
set up the bloody flag against all 
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing: all peace you in their 
is, both parties knaves. You are 
a pair of strange ones.

BRUTUS:
Come, come, you are well understood to be a 
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol. 

MENENIUS: 
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
you best the purpose, it not worth 
wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud; 
who in cheap estimation, is worth predecessors 
though peradventure some of the 
best 'em were hereditary God-den to 
your worships: more of your conversation would
infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you. 
How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
your eyes so fast? 


Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
the love of Juno, let's go. 

MENENIUS:
Ha! Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
approbation.
 
MENENIUS: 
Take my Jupiter, and I Hoo! 
Marcius coming home! 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Nay,'tis true. 
 
VOLUMNIA:
Look, here's letter from him: the state hath 
another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
at home for 

MENENIUS: 
I will my very house reel tonight: letter for 


VIRGILIA: 
Yes, there's a letter you; I saw't. 
 
MENENIUS:
A letter for me! it gives me estate seven 
years' health; which time I will make a lip at 
the physician: most sovereign prescription in 
Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
of no better than a horse-drench. Is 
not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded. 
 
VIRGILIA:
O, no, no, no. 

VOLUMNIA:
O, he is I thank the for't. 
 
MENENIUS: 
So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
victory in his pocket? the wounds become 

VOLUMNIA: 
On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
with the oaken garland.
 

Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Titus writes, they together, 
Aufidius got off. 

MENENIUS:
And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold 
that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?

VOLUMNIA:
Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
son the whole name of the war: he hath in this 
action outdone his former deeds doubly 
 

In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.

MENENIUS: 
Wondrous! I you, and his 
true purchasing. 

VIRGILIA:
The gods grant them true!
 
VOLUMNIA:
pow, wow. 
 
MENENIUS:
True! I'll be sworn they are true. 
Where is he wounded?
save your worships! is 
home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?

VOLUMNIA: 
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
stand for his place. He received in of 
Tarquin seven hurts i' the body. 

MENENIUS: 
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
nine that I know.
 

He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
wounds upon him.

MENENIUS: 
Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
Hark! the trumpets. 

VOLUMNIA: 
These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
being advanced, and men die. 

Herald:
Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; 
In honour follows Coriolanus. 
to Rome, renowned 
 
All: 
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
 
CORIOLANUS:
No more this; offend my heart: 
no more. 

COMINIUS:
sir, your mother! 

CORIOLANUS: 
O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
For my prosperity! 
 
VOLUMNIA:
Nay, my good soldier, up;
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and 
By honour 
What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?-- 
But O, thy wife! 

CORIOLANUS:
My gracious silence, hail!
thou have I coffin'd home, 
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
Such eyes the in wear, 
And mothers that lack sons. 
 
MENENIUS:
Now, the gods crown thee!
 
CORIOLANUS:
And live you yet?
my sweet pardon. 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
I know not where to turn: welcome home: 
And welcome, and ye're all. 
 
MENENIUS:
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
A curse begin at very root on's heart, 
That is not glad to see thee! You are three
That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
have some old crab-trees here 
at home that will not
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
We but a nettle and 
The faults of fools but folly.
 
COMINIUS:
Ever right.
 
CORIOLANUS:
Menenius ever, ever.

Herald:
Give way there, and go on!

CORIOLANUS: 


I have lived 
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy: only
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee. 

CORIOLANUS:
Know, good 
I had rather be their servant in my way,
Than sway with them in theirs.

COMINIUS:
On, to Capitol! 

BRUTUS: 
All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry 
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins 
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clambering to eye him: stalls, bulks, 
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular and puff 
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
As if that whatsoever god who leads him 
slily into his human powers 
And gave him graceful 
 
SICINIUS:
On the sudden,
I warrant him consul. 

BRUTUS: 
Then our office may,
During his power, go sleep.

SICINIUS: 
He cannot temperately transport his honours
where he should but will 
Lose those he hath won. 

BRUTUS: 
In that there's comfort. 
 
SICINIUS:
Doubt not
The for whom we stand, but they 
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least these his new honours, which 
That he will give them make little question 
As is do't. 
 
BRUTUS: 
I heard him swear,
Were he stand for never would he 
Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To the people, beg their stinking breaths.

SICINIUS:
'Tis right.
 

It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
And the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS: 
I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
In execution.
 
BRUTUS:
'Tis most like he will.
 
SICINIUS: 
shall be to him then our good wills, 
A sure destruction.
 
BRUTUS:
So it must fall out 
To him or our authorities. For an end, 
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
made them mules, silenced their pleaders and 
Dispropertied freedoms, holding them, 
In human action and capacity, 
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in the who have their provand 
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.

SICINIUS: 
This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
To their dry stubble; and their blaze 
darken him for ever. 

BRUTUS:
What's the matter?
 
Messenger: 
You for to the 'Tis thought 
Marcius shall be consul: 
I seen the throng to see him and 
The to bear him speak: matrons gloves, 
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers, 
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
A shower and thunder their caps and shouts: 
I never saw the like. 

BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol;
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
But hearts for the 


you. 

First Officer:
Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
for consulships?
 
Second Officer:
Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
will carry it. 
 
First Officer:
That's a brave fellow; but he's proud, 
loves not the common people.
 
Second Officer: 
Faith, there had been many great men that have
flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
be many that have loved, they know not 
so that, they love they not 
they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly 

First Officer: 
If he did not whether their love or no, 
he indifferently 'twixt doing them 
good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than can render it him; and leaves
nothing undone fully discover him their 
opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
dislikes, to flatter them for their 

Second 
deserved worthily country: and his 
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
having been supple and courteous to the people,
bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
an into their estimation and but so 
planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
malice, that, giving itself the lie, pluck 
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
 
First Officer:
No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
are coming. 
 
MENENIUS:
Having determined of the Volsces and
To for Titus Lartius, it remains, 
As the main point of this our after-meeting,
To gratify his noble service that
Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
please you,
Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
The consul, and last general 
In our well-found successes, to report
A little of that worthy work perform'd
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom 
met both to thank and to remember 
With honours like himself. 

First Senator:
Speak, good Cominius: 
Leave nothing out for and make us think 
our state's defective for 
Than we to stretch it out.
Masters o' the people, 
We do request your and after, 
Your loving motion toward the common 
To yield what passes here.
 
SICINIUS: 
We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts 
Inclinable to and 
The theme of our assembly. 

BRUTUS: 
Which the rather
We shall be blest to do, if he remember
A value of the people than 
He hath hereto prized them at.

MENENIUS: 
That's off, that's off;
I would you rather had been silent. Please you
To hear Cominius speak?
 
BRUTUS:
Most willingly;
But yet my caution was more 
Than the rebuke you give it.
 
MENENIUS:
He loves your people
But tie not to be their bedfellow. 
Worthy Cominius, speak. 
Nay, keep your place.

First Senator:
Sit, Coriolanus; never shame hear 
What you have nobly done.


Your horror's pardon:
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them. 
 
BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope 
My words not. 


sir: yet oft, 
When blows made me stay, from words. 
soothed not, therefore hurt not: 
your people, 
I love them as they weigh. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Pray now, sit down.

CORIOLANUS: 
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monster'd.
 

Masters of the people,
Your multiplying spawn how 
That's to one good one--when you now 
had venture all his for honour 
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
Most dignifies haver: if it 
The man I speak of in the world 
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
When Tarquin made a for he fought 
Beyond the others: our then 
Whom with all I point at, saw him fight, 
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
o'er-press'd Roman and i' the view 
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
When he might act the woman in the scene,
He best man i' the field, and for his meed 
Was brow-bound oak. pupil age 
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
Before and in Corioli, let me say,
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
And fell below stem: his sword, death's stamp, 
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
He was a blood, whose every motion 
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
with a reinforcement struck 
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When, by, the din of gan 
His ready sense; straight his doubled spirit 
what in flesh was fatigate, 
And to the battle came he; where he did
Run o'er the lives of as if 
'Twere a perpetual spoil: till we call'd 
Both and city ours, he never stood 
To ease breast with panting. 
 
MENENIUS:
Worthy man! 

First Senator:
He but with measure the honours 
Which we devise 

COMINIUS:
Our spoils he kick'd at,
look'd upon things precious as they were 
The common muck of the world: he covets less
Than misery itself would give; rewards
His deeds with doing them, and is content 
To spend the time to end it.
 
MENENIUS: 
He's right noble:
Let him be call'd for. 
 
First Senator:
Call Coriolanus.
 
Officer:
He doth appear. 

MENENIUS: 
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
To make thee consul. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I do owe them still
My and services. 

MENENIUS: 
It then remains 
That you do speak to the people.

CORIOLANUS:
I do beseech 
Let that custom, for I cannot 
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: you 
That pass this doing. 

SICINIUS: 
Sir, the people
Must have their voices; neither will they bate
jot of ceremony. 

MENENIUS: 
Put them not to't: 
Pray you, go fit you the custom and 
Take to you, as your predecessors have,
Your honour with your form.

CORIOLANUS:
It is apart 
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the people.
 
BRUTUS:
Mark you that?
 
CORIOLANUS:
To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
As if I had received the hire 
Of their breath only!

MENENIUS: 
Do not stand upon't.
We to you, tribunes of the people, 
Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
Wish we all joy and honour.

Senators:
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
 
BRUTUS:
You see how he intends to use the people. 

SICINIUS: 
May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
As if he did contemn what he requested
Should be to 

BRUTUS: 
Come, we'll inform them
Of our proceedings here: on 
I know, they do attend us.

First Citizen: 
Once, if he do require voices, we ought not to deny him. 
 
Second Citizen:
We may, sir, if we will.
 
Third Citizen:
We have power in ourselves to do but is a 
power that we have no to do; show 
his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
tongues those wounds and speak them; so, if 
tell us his deeds, must also tell him 
our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
we members, should bring ourselves be 
monstrous members. 

First Citizen:
And to make us no better thought of, a little help
will serve; for once stood up the he 
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
 
Third 
We have been called so of many; not that our heads
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
and their consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the points o' the compass.

Second Citizen: 
you so? way do you judge my wit would 
fly?

Third 
Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a but 
it were liberty, 'twould, sure, southward. 

Second Citizen:
Why that way? 

Third Citizen:
To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
for conscience sake, to help get thee a wife. 

Second Citizen:
You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
 
Third Citizen:
you resolved to give your voices? But 
that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
say, if he would to the people, there 
worthier man. 
Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
by threes. He's to make his requests by
particulars; wherein every of us has single 
honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
tongues: therefore follow me, and I how 
you shall go by him.

All: 
Content, content. 

MENENIUS:
O sir, you are not right: have you known 
The worthiest men have done't? 


What must I say? 
Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I bring 
My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds! 
I got them in country's service, when 
certain your brethren and ran 
From the noise of our own drums.'

MENENIUS:
O me, the gods! 
You must not speak of that: you must desire them
To think upon you. 

CORIOLANUS:
Think upon me! hang 'em!
I would they would forget the virtues 
Which our divines lose by 'em.

MENENIUS:
You'll mar all:
I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
In wholesome manner. 

CORIOLANUS: 
Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean.
So, comes a brace. 
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
 
Citizen: 
We do, tell us what hath you to't. 
 
CORIOLANUS:
Mine own desert. 

Second Citizen:
Your own desert! 


Ay, but not mine own desire. 

Third Citizen: 
How not your own desire?

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the 
poor with begging.
 
Third Citizen: 
You think, give you any thing, we hope to 
gain by you.

CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
 
First Citizen: 
price is to ask it kindly. 

CORIOLANUS: 
Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
show which shall be yours in private. Your 
good voice, sir; what say you?

Second Citizen:
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS:
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
I have your alms: adieu. 
 
Third Citizen: 
But this is something odd.

Second Citizen:
An give 'tis no matter. 

CORIOLANUS:
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that I may be consul, I have here the
customary gown. 
 
Fourth Citizen:
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
have not deserved nobly. 
 
CORIOLANUS:
Your enigma? 

Fourth Citizen: 
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
been a rod to her friends; you not indeed loved 
the common people.
 
CORIOLANUS:
You should account me the more virtuous that I have
been common in my love. I sir, flatter my 
sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
estimation of 'tis condition they account 
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is 
rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
insinuating nod and be them most 
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful the desirers. you, 
I may be consul.
 
Fifth Citizen:
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
you our heartily. 
 
Citizen: 
You many wounds for your country. 
 
CORIOLANUS:
I not seal your knowledge showing them. I 
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.

Citizens: 
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Most voices! 
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this toge should I here, 
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do 
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
The dust on time would lie unswept, 
And mountainous too highly heapt 
For truth o'er-peer. Rather than fool so, 
office the honour go 
one that would do thus. am through; 
The part suffer'd, the other will I do. 
Here come more voices.
Your voices: voices have fought; 
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd; thrice six 
I have seen and heard of; for your voices 
Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
Indeed I would be consul.

Sixth Citizen: 
has done nobly, cannot go without any honest 
man's voice.

Citizen: 
Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
and make him good friend to the people!

All 
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!

CORIOLANUS:
Worthy voices!
 
MENENIUS: 
have stood your limitation; and the 
Endue you with the people's voice: 
That, in the official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the senate.

CORIOLANUS: 
Is this done?

SICINIUS:
custom of you have discharged: 
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.
 
CORIOLANUS:
Where? at the 
 
SICINIUS: 
There, Coriolanus. 


May I change these garments?

SICINIUS:
You may, sir.

CORIOLANUS:
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the senate-house.
 
MENENIUS:
I'll keep you company. Will you along? 

BRUTUS:
We stay here for the people. 

SICINIUS:
you well. 
it now, and his looks 
'Tis warm heart. 

BRUTUS: 
With a proud he wore his humble weeds. 
will you dismiss the 

SICINIUS:
How now, my masters! have you chose this man?

First Citizen:
He has voices, sir. 

BRUTUS: 
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

Second Citizen:
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
 
Third Citizen:
Certainly
He flouted downright. 
 
First Citizen:
No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
 
Second Citizen:
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.


he did, I am sure. 


No, no; no man saw 'em.
 
Third Citizen: 
He he had wounds, which he could 
in private;
his thus waving in scorn, 
'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom, 
But by your will not 
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
Here was 'I thank you voices: thank you: 
most sweet voices: now you left 
your voices,
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS: 
either were you ignorant to 
Or, such childish friendliness 
To yield your voices?
 
BRUTUS:
Could you not have told him
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
But was a servant to the state, 
He your enemy, against 
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
the body of the and now, arriving 
place of and sway o' the state, 
If he still malignantly remain 
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? should have said 
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what stood for, so his gracious nature 
Would think upon you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your lord. 

SICINIUS:
Thus to have said, 
As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
his inclination; from pluck'd 
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
As had call'd you up, have held him to 
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage, 
should have ta'en the advantage his choler 
And pass'd him unelected.
 
BRUTUS: 
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves, and you 
That his contempt shall not to you, 
When power to crush? had your bodies 
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment? 
 
SICINIUS: 

Ere now denied asker? and now again 
Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow


Third Citizen: 
He's not confirm'd; deny him 

Second Citizen:
And will deny him:
I'll have five hundred voices that sound. 

First Citizen: 
I five hundred and their friends to 'em. 

BRUTUS:
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
have chose a consul that will from them take 
Their liberties; them no more voice 
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so. 

SICINIUS:
Let assemble, 
And on a safer judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
his hate unto you; besides, forget not 
With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took you 
The apprehension his present portance, 
most ungravely, did fashion 
After the inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS: 
Lay
A fault on us, tribunes; that we laboured, 
No impediment but that you 
Cast your election on him. 

SICINIUS:
Say, you chose him
More after our commandment than as guided 
By your own true affections, and that your minds,
Preoccupied with what you rather must do 
what you should, made you against the grain 
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS: 
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
youngly he began to serve country, 
How long continued, and what he springs of, 
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
And  
Twice being  
Was his great ancestor. 
 
SICINIUS:
thus descended, 
That hath beside well in his person wrought
To be set in place, we did commend 
your remembrances: have found, 
Scaling his present bearing with his past,
he's your fixed enemy, and revoke 
Your sudden approbation. 

BRUTUS:
Say, ne'er had done't-- 
Harp on that still--but by our putting on; 
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair the 

All: 
We will so: almost all
Repent in election. 
 
BRUTUS:
go on; 
This were better put in hazard, 
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
With their refusal, both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger.

SICINIUS:
To the Capitol, come:
We will be there before the stream o' the 
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
Which we have goaded onward.

CORIOLANUS:
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

LARTIUS: 
He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
Our swifter composition.
 
CORIOLANUS:
So then stand but as first, 
Ready, shall prompt them, road. 
Upon's again.

COMINIUS: 
They are worn, lord consul, so,
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners again. 

CORIOLANUS: 
you Aufidius? 
 
LARTIUS:
On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
Against the Volsces, they had vilely 
Yielded the town: he is to Antium. 
 
CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of me?
 

He did, my lord.

CORIOLANUS: 
How? what? 

LARTIUS:
How often he had met you, sword to sword;
That of all things the earth he 
Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
To hopeless restitution, so he might 
Be call'd your vanquisher.
 
CORIOLANUS: 
At Antium he? 
 
LARTIUS:
At Antium. 

CORIOLANUS: 
I wish I a cause to seek him there, 
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
these the of 
The tongues common mouth: I despise them; 
For do them in authority, 
Against all noble sufferance.

SICINIUS: 
Pass no further. 

CORIOLANUS: 
Ha! is that? 
 
BRUTUS:
It will be dangerous go on: further. 
 
CORIOLANUS:
What makes this change?

MENENIUS:
The matter?

COMINIUS: 
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

BRUTUS:
Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS:
Have I had children's voices?

First Senator:
Tribunes, way; he to the market-place. 
 
BRUTUS: 
The people are incensed against him.
 
SICINIUS: 
Stop, 
Or all will fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS:
your 
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight their tongues? What are 
your offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set on? 

MENENIUS:
Be calm, be calm. 

CORIOLANUS: 
It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
curb the will of nobility: 
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will ruled. 


Call't not a plot:
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
When corn given them gratis, repined; 
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them 
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS:
Why, this was known before.
 
BRUTUS: 
Not them all. 

CORIOLANUS: 
Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS: 
How! I inform them!

CORIOLANUS: 
You are like do such business. 

BRUTUS: 
Not unlike, 
Each to better 

CORIOLANUS:
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Let me deserve so ill as make me 
Your tribune. 

SICINIUS: 
show too of that 
For which the people stir: if you will pass
To you are bound, you must inquire your way, 
Which are out of, with gentler 
Or be so noble a consul, 
Nor yoke with him for tribune.

MENENIUS: 
Let's be calm. 
 
COMINIUS: 
The abused; on. paltering 
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour'd falsely 
I' the plain way of his merit.
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Tell me of corn!
This was speech, and I will again-- 

MENENIUS: 
Not now, not now.
 
First 
Not in this heat, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS: 
Now, as I live, I My nobler friends, 
I crave their pardons: 
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let 
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
Therein behold themselves: I say again,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, 
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
and scatter'd, 
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number, 
Who not virtue, nor power, but 
they have given to beggars. 

MENENIUS: 
Well, no 

First Senator:
No more beseech you. 

CORIOLANUS: 
How! no 
As for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against measles, 
Which should tatter yet sought 
The way to catch them. 
 
BRUTUS: 
You the people, 
As if you were a god to punish, not
A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS:
'Twere well
We let people know't. 

MENENIUS: 
What, his choler? 
 
CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

SICINIUS: 
It is a mind
That remain a poison it 
Not poison any further.


Shall remain!
Hear this Triton of the minnows? you 
His absolute 'shall'? 
 
COMINIUS: 
'Twas from the canon.

CORIOLANUS: 
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
with his peremptory 'shall,' being 
The horn o' the monster's, wants not 
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If have power 
Then vail your ignorance; if awake 
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as fools; if you are not, 
them cushions by you. You are 
If they be senators: and they are no less,
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,' 
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
To know, when two authorities are up,
Neither how soon 
May 'twixt the gap of both take 
The one by the other. 
 
COMINIUS:
Well, on to the market-place. 

CORIOLANUS: 
Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in Greece,-- 

MENENIUS: 
Well, well, no more of that.
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Though there the people had more absolute power,
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state. 
 
BRUTUS:
Why, people give 
that their 

CORIOLANUS: 
give my reasons, 
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our resting well 
That ne'er did for't: being press'd to the war, 
when the navel of the was touch'd, 
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
Their mutinies and wherein they show'd 
valour, not for them: the 
Which they have often made against the senate,
All cause unborn, could never be the motive
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
shall multitude digest 
The courtesy? Let express 
What's be their words: 'we request it; 
We are greater poll, and in true fear 
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Call cares which will in time 
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
The crows peck the eagles. 
 

Come, 
 
BRUTUS: 
Enough, with over-measure.

CORIOLANUS: 
No, take more: 
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of general ignorance,--it must omit
necessities, and way the while 
To unstable purpose so barr'd, 
it follows,
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
That love the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
A noble life before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure of without it, at once out 
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet is their your dishonour 
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become't,
Not having the power do the good it 
For the which doth control't. 
 
BRUTUS:
Has said enough. 

SICINIUS: 
Has spoken like a traitor, and answer 
traitors do. 
 

Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes? 
On whom depending, their obedience fails 
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
Let what is meet said must meet, 
throw their power dust. 

BRUTUS:
Manifest treason! 

SICINIUS:
This a consul? no.

BRUTUS:
aediles, ho! 
Let him be apprehended.

SICINIUS:
call the people: 
in whose name myself 
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
A foe the public weal: obey, I thee, 
And follow to thine answer.

CORIOLANUS: 
Hence, old goat!
 
&C: 
We'll surety him.

COMINIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments.
 
SICINIUS:
Help, ye citizens!
 
MENENIUS:
On both sides more respect.
 
SICINIUS:
Here's he that would take from you all your power.

BRUTUS: 
Seize him, 


Down with him! down with him!
 
Senators, &C:
Weapons, weapons, weapons!
'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'

MENENIUS:
What about I am of breath; 
near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes 
To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius.

SICINIUS:
Hear me, people; peace! 

Citizens: 
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, 
 
SICINIUS: 
You are at to lose liberties: 
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
Whom late you have named for consul.
 
MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

First Senator:
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.

SICINIUS: 
What is the city but the people? 
 
Citizens:
True, 
The people are the city.
 
BRUTUS: 
By the consent of all, we were establish'd
The people's magistrates.

Citizens: 
You remain. 


And so are like to do.
 
COMINIUS: 
That is the way to lay the city flat;
To bring the roof to the 
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
In heaps and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS: 
This deserves 
 

Or let stand to our 
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Upon part o' the people, in whose power 
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
Of present death. 

SICINIUS:
Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
Into destruction cast him. 
 
BRUTUS: 
AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens:
Yield, Marcius, yield! 

MENENIUS:
Hear me one word;
Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
 
AEdile:
Peace, peace! 
 
MENENIUS:
 
BRUTUS:
Sir, those cold ways,
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
And bear him to the rock. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
I'll die here. 
There's some among beheld me 
Come, try yourselves have seen me. 


Down with sword! Tribunes, withdraw 

BRUTUS: 
Lay hands 
 
COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You that be noble; help him, 

Citizens: 
Down with him, down with him!

MENENIUS: 
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else.

Second Senator:
Get you gone.

COMINIUS:
Stand fast;
We as friends as enemies. 

MENENIUS: 
Sham it be put to that? 

First Senator:
The forbid! 
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
Leave cure this cause. 

MENENIUS: 
For 'tis a sore upon us,
You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.

COMINIUS:
Come, sir, along with us.
 
CORIOLANUS:
I would they were barbarians--as they are,
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not, 
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol-- 

MENENIUS:
Be 
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
One time will owe another.
 
CORIOLANUS:
On fair ground
I beat forty them. 

COMINIUS: 
I myself 
Take up brace o' the best of them; yea, the 
two tribunes:
'tis odds beyond arithmetic; 
manhood call'd foolery, when it 
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
What they are used to bear.
 
MENENIUS:
Pray you, be gone: 
I'll try whether my old wit be in request
have but little: this must be patch'd 
With cloth of any colour.
 
COMINIUS:
Nay, come away. 

A Patrician:
This man has marr'd his fortune.

MENENIUS:
His nature too noble for the world: 
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
What his forges, his tongue must 
And, being angry, does forget that ever
He heard the name of death.
Here's goodly work! 

Second Patrician:
I would they were abed!
 
MENENIUS: 
I would they were in the vengeance! 
Could he not speak 'em fair?
 
SICINIUS:
Where is this viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself?

MENENIUS: 
You worthy tribunes,--

SICINIUS:
He thrown down the Tarpeian rock 
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted 
therefore shall scorn further trial 
Than the severity of the public power
Which so nought. 
 
First Citizen:
He 
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
And we their hands.

Citizens:
He shall, sure 
 
MENENIUS: 
Sir, sir,-- 


Peace! 
 
MENENIUS: 
Do not cry you but 
With warrant. 
 
SICINIUS:
Sir, how comes't that you
Have holp to make this rescue?

MENENIUS:
Hear me speak:
As I do know the consul's worthiness,
So can name his faults,-- 

SICINIUS:
what consul? 

MENENIUS: 
The 

BRUTUS: 
consul! 

Citizens:
No, no, no, no, no.

MENENIUS:
If, by the leave, and yours, people, 
I may be would crave a word or 
The turn you no further harm 
Than so much loss of time.

SICINIUS: 
Speak briefly then;
For are peremptory to dispatch 
This viperous traitor: to him hence 
Were but one danger, and to keep him here
Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
dies to-night. 

MENENIUS: 
Now the gods 
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
Towards deserved is enroll'd 
In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam 
Should now eat up her own!
 
SICINIUS:
He's a disease that must be cut away.
 
MENENIUS: 
O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
to cut it off; to cure easy. 
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our the blood lost-- 
Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
By many an dropp'd it for 
And what is left, to lose it by his country,
Were to all, that do't and suffer it, 
A brand to the end o' the world. 
 
SICINIUS: 
This is clean kam.

BRUTUS:
Merely awry: when did love his 
It honour'd him.

MENENIUS: 
The service of the foot
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
what before it was. 
 
BRUTUS: 
hear no more. 
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
Lest his infection, being catching nature, 
further. 

MENENIUS:
One word more, one word.
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
The of unscann'd swiftness, will too late 
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Lest parties, as he is out, 
And sack great Rome with Romans.

BRUTUS:
If it were so,-- 
 

What do ye 
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
 

Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars 
Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd 
In bolted meal and bran 
He throws distinction. me leave, 
I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
In peace, to his utmost peril.

First 
Noble tribunes, 
It is the humane way: the other course
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
Unknown to the beginning. 
 

Noble Menenius, 
Be you then as the officer. 
Masters, lay down your weapons.
 
BRUTUS:
Go home. 

SICINIUS: 
Meet on the market-place. We'll you there: 
Where, if you bring not Marcius, proceed 
In our first way.
 
MENENIUS:
I'll bring to you. 
Let me desire your company: he must come,
Or what is worst will follow. 

Senator: 
Pray you, let's to 
 

them puff about mine present me 
Death on the at wild horses' heels, 
Or pile ten hills on the rock, 
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
Be thus to them. 
 
A Patrician: 
You do the nobler. 

CORIOLANUS: 
I muse my mother
Does not approve me further, who was wont
To call them woollen vassals, things 
To buy and sell groats, to show heads 
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
When one my ordinance stood up 
To speak of peace or war.
I talk of 
Why you wish me milder? would you have me 
False to my nature? Rather say I play
man am. 

VOLUMNIA: 
sir, sir, sir, 
I would have had you put power well on, 
Before you had worn it out.
 
CORIOLANUS:
go. 

VOLUMNIA: 
You might have been enough the man you are,
With striving less to be so; lesser had been
The thwartings of your dispositions, if 
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
Ere they lack'd cross you. 

CORIOLANUS: 
Let them hang. 

A Patrician: 
Ay, burn too. 
 
MENENIUS:
Come, come, you been rough, something 
too rough; 
must return and mend it. 

First 
no 
Unless, by not our good city 
Cleave the perish. 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Pray, be counsell'd: 
I a heart as little apt as yours, 
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
To better vantage.
 
MENENIUS:
Well said, noble 
Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
The violent o' the time craves it as physic 
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
Which I can scarcely bear.

CORIOLANUS:
What must I do? 

MENENIUS: 
to the tribunes. 
 
CORIOLANUS:
Well, then? 


Repent what you have spoke.
 
CORIOLANUS: 
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I them? 

VOLUMNIA:
You are too absolute; 
therein can never be too noble, 
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me, 
In peace what each of them by the other 
That they combine not there.
 
CORIOLANUS:
Tush, tush! 

MENENIUS:
A good demand.

VOLUMNIA:
it honour your wars to seem 
The you are not, which, for your best ends, 
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
That it shall hold companionship in peace
With honour, as in war, since that to both
It stands in like request?
 

Why force you this?

VOLUMNIA: 
Because that now it lies you on to speak
To people; not your own instruction, 
Nor by the matter which your you, 
But with such words that are but rooted in 
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
Now, this no more dishonours you at all
Than to take in a town with gentle words,
Which else would put you to your fortune and
The hazard of much 
I would dissemble with my nature where
fortunes and friends at stake required 
so honour: in this, 
wife, your son, these senators, nobles; 
And you will rather show general louts 
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard 
Of what that want might ruin. 

MENENIUS: 
Noble lady!
go with us; speak you may salve so, 
Not what is dangerous present, but the loss 
Of what is past. 


I prithee now, my son,
Go to them, this in thy hand; 
And thus far having stretch'd it--here be 
Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant 
More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not hold the handling: or say to them, 
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
In asking good loves, but thou wilt frame 
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
As thou hast power person. 

MENENIUS:
This but done,
she speaks, their hearts were yours; 
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free 
As to little purpose. 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Prithee now,
Go, be ruled: although I thou hadst rather 
thine in fiery 
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
 
COMINIUS:
I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
You make strong party, or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.

MENENIUS:
Only fair speech.

COMINIUS: 
I think 'twill serve, if he
Can thereto frame his spirit.


He must, and will
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.


Must I show them my unbarbed 
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart 
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
This mould of they to dust grind it 
And throw't against the wind. the market-place! 
You have put me now to a part which never 
I shall discharge the life. 

COMINIUS:
Come, come, we'll prompt you.

VOLUMNIA: 
I as thou said 
My praises made thee first soldier, 
To my praise for this, perform part 
Thou hast not done before.


Well, I must do't:
Away, my disposition, and me 
Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
as an eunuch, or the virgin 
babies asleep! the smiles of knaves 
Tent in my and schoolboys' tears take up 
The glasses of my sight! a tongue 
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
That hath received an alms! I will do't, 
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
by my body's action teach my mind 
A most inherent baseness. 

VOLUMNIA:
At thy choice, then:
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than 
dangerous for I mock at death 
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
But owe thy pride thyself.
 
CORIOLANUS:
Pray, be content:
Mother, I am going to the market-place;
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
Cog their from them, and come home beloved 
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
Commend me to my wife. I'll consul; 
Or never to what tongue can do 
I' the further. 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Do your will.

COMINIUS: 
Away! the tribunes do attend you: yourself 
To answer mildly; for they are prepared
With accusations, as hear, more strong 
Than are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS:
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
Let them accuse me by invention, I
Will in mine honour. 
 
MENENIUS:
mildly. 


Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
 
BRUTUS: 
In this point charge him home, that he affects 
Tyrannical power: he evade us there, 
Enforce him with his envy to the people,
And that the spoil got on the Antiates 
Was distributed. 
What, will he come?
 
AEdile:
coming. 


accompanied? 
 
AEdile: 
With old Menenius, and those senators
That favour'd 

SICINIUS:
Have you a 
the voices that we have procured 
Set down by the 
 
AEdile: 
I have; ready. 

SICINIUS: 
Have you collected them by tribes?
 
AEdile: 
I have.
 
SICINIUS: 
Assemble presently the people hither; 
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the old prerogative
And power i' the truth o' the cause.

AEdile: 
shall inform them. 

BRUTUS:
And when such time they have begun to cry,
Let them not cease, but with a din confused
Enforce the present execution
what we to sentence. 
 
AEdile: 
Very well.
 
SICINIUS: 
Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
When we shall hap to give 't them.

BRUTUS: 
Go about it.
to choler straight: he hath used 
Ever to conquer, to have his worth 
Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot 
Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
What's heart; and that is which looks 
With us to break his neck.
 
SICINIUS:
Well, here he comes.

MENENIUS: 
Calmly, I do beseech you.
 

Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice 
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's! 
our large temples with the shows 
And our streets with 
 
First Senator:
Amen, amen.

MENENIUS:
A noble wish.

SICINIUS:
Draw near, ye people.

AEdile:
List to your tribunes. peace, I say! 

CORIOLANUS: 
First, hear me speak.

Both Tribunes:
Well, say. Peace, ho!
 
CORIOLANUS:
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?

SICINIUS: 
I do demand,
If you submit to the voices, 
Allow their officers and are content
To lawful censure for such faults 
As shall be proved upon you?

CORIOLANUS:
I am content. 
 
MENENIUS:
Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
The warlike service he has done, consider; think
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
Like graves i' the holy churchyard.

CORIOLANUS: 
Scratches with briers, 
Scars to move laughter only. 
 

Consider further, 
That when he speaks not like a citizen,
You find him like a soldier: do not take
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
Rather envy you. 
 
COMINIUS:
Well, well, no more.
 
CORIOLANUS: 
What is the 
That being pass'd for consul full voice, 
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
take off again? 

SICINIUS:
Answer to us.

CORIOLANUS:
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.


We charge you, that you have contrived to take
From Rome all season'd office and wind 
Yourself into a power tyrannical;
which are a people. 

CORIOLANUS: 
How! traitor!

MENENIUS:
Nay, temperately; your promise. 

CORIOLANUS:
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
In thy clutch'd many millions, in 
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
'Thou liest' a voice as free 
As I do gods. 

SICINIUS:
Mark you people? 
 
Citizens:
To the rock, to the rock with him! 
 

Peace!
We need not put new matter to his 
What you have him do and him speak, 
Beating your officers, cursing yourselves, 
Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
Those whose great power must try him; even this, 
So and in such capital kind, 
Deserves the extremest death.

BRUTUS: 
But since he hath
Served well for Rome,--

CORIOLANUS:
What do you prate of service?
 
BRUTUS: 
I talk of that, that know it.

CORIOLANUS:
You? 

MENENIUS: 
Is this the promise you made your mother? 

COMINIUS:
Know, I pray you,--
 

I know no further: 
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death, 
exile, raying, to linger 
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
cheque my courage for they can give, 
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
 

that has, 
As much as him from time time 
Envied against the people, seeking means
To pluck away their power, as now at last 
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
dreaded justice, on ministers 
That do distribute it; in the name the people 
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
Even from this instant, banish him our city,
In peril of precipitation
From off Tarpeian more 
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
I say it shall so. 
 

It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.


Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--

SICINIUS:
He's sentenced; no more hearing.
 
COMINIUS:
Let me speak:
I have been consul, and show Rome 
enemies' marks upon me. do 
My good with a more tender, 
More and profound, than 
wife's estimate, her increase, 
And treasure of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,--
 
SICINIUS:
know drift: speak what? 

BRUTUS: 
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
As enemy to the people and his country:
It shall be so.
 
Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so.

CORIOLANUS:
You cry of curs! whose breath I hate 
reek o' the rotten fens, loves I prize 
carcasses of unburied men 
That do air, I banish 
And here remain with uncertainty! 
Let feeble rumour shake hearts! 
Your with nodding of their plumes, 
Fan into despair! Have power still 
To banish your defenders; till at length
which finds not it 
Making not reservation of yourselves,
Still your foes, deliver you 
Abated captives to some nation 
won you without blows! Despising, 
For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
There world elsewhere. 


The enemy is gone, is gone! 
 

Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!
 
SICINIUS:
Go, see him out at gates, and follow him, 
As he hath followed you, 
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard 
Attend us through the city.

Citizens: 
Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.

CORIOLANUS: 
leave your tears: a farewell: the beast 
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
Where is your ancient courage? you were used
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
That common chances common men could bear;
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows, 
When home, being gentle craves 
A noble cunning: you were used to load me 
With precepts that would make invincible
The heart that conn'd them.

VIRGILIA: 
O heavens! O heavens!
 
CORIOLANUS:
Nay! woman,-- 
 
VOLUMNIA:
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
And occupations perish!

CORIOLANUS:
What, 
I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
Resume that spirit, when you were say, 
had been the wife of Hercules, 
Six of you'ld have done, and saved 
Your so Cominius, 
Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women 
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
'tis to laugh at 'em. My wot well 
My hazards still have been your solace: and
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
Like to lonely dragon, that fen 
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
exceed the common caught 
With cautelous baits and practise.

VOLUMNIA:
My first son. 
Whither wilt thou go? good Cominius 
With thee determine on course, 
More than wild to each chance 
That i' the way before thee. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
O the gods! 
 
COMINIUS: 
I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
we of so if time thrust forth 
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send 
O'er vast world to seek a single man, 
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
I' the absence of the needer.
 
CORIOLANUS:
Fare ye 
Thou hast years upon and thou art full 
surfeits, to go rove with one 
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
While I remain above the ground, you shall
Hear from me still, and never of aught 
But what is like me formerly.
 
MENENIUS: 
That's 
As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
If could off but one seven years 
From old arms and by good gods, 
I'ld thee foot. 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Give me thy hand: Come.
 
SICINIUS:
Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further. 
The nobility are we see have sided 
In his behalf.
 
BRUTUS: 
Now we have shown our 
Let us seem humbler after it is done
when it was a-doing. 

SICINIUS:
Bid them home:
Say their great enemy is gone, and they
Stand their ancient 

BRUTUS: 
them home. 
Here comes his mother.
 
SICINIUS:
Let's not meet her. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Why? 
 
SICINIUS:
They say 


They have us: keep on your way. 
 
VOLUMNIA:
O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
Requite your love!


Peace, peace; be not loud. 
 
VOLUMNIA:
If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
Nay, and shall hear some. 
Will you be gone?
 
VIRGILIA:
 
SICINIUS:
Are you mankind?
 
VOLUMNIA: 
Ay, fool; is that a shame? but this 
Was not a my Hadst 
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
Than thou hast spoken words? 

SICINIUS:
O blessed heavens!

VOLUMNIA: 
More than ever thou wise words; 
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee yet go: 
Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would son 
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him, 
His good sword in his hand.
 
SICINIUS:
What then?
 
VIRGILIA: 
What then!
He'ld an end thy posterity. 

VOLUMNIA:
Bastards and all.
Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
 
MENENIUS: 
Come, come, peace.

SICINIUS:
I would he had continued to his country
As he began, and not unknit himself
The knot he made. 

BRUTUS: 
would he had. 
 
VOLUMNIA: 
'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth 
As I can of those mysteries which heaven
Will not have earth to know.

BRUTUS: 
Pray, let us go.
 
VOLUMNIA:
Now, pray, get you gone: 
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
As far as Capitol exceed 
The meanest house in so far my son-- 
This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
Whom you have does exceed all. 
 
BRUTUS: 
Well, we'll leave you. 
 
SICINIUS: 
Why stay to be 
With one that wants her wits?

VOLUMNIA: 
Take my prayers with you. 
I would the gods had nothing else to do
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
Of what to't. 

MENENIUS:
You have them 
And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?

VOLUMNIA: 
Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

MENENIUS: 
fie! 

Roman: 
I know you well, sir, you know 
me: your name, I think, is Adrian.

Volsce:
It is so, sir: I have forgot you. 


I am a my services are, 
as are, against 'em: know you me yet? 
 
Volsce: 
Nicanor? no. 

Roman:
sir. 
 
Volsce: 
You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
news in Rome? I have a note the state, 
to find you out there: you have well saved me a
day's journey.

Roman: 
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
people against the senators, patricians, and nobles. 

Volsce:
Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and 
hope to come upon the heat of division. 

Roman: 
The main blaze of is but a small thing 
would make flame again: for the nobles 
to the banishment of that worthy 
Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the people to pluck from them 
their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
breaking out.

Volsce:
Coriolanus banished!

Roman: 
Banished, sir.

Volsce:
You will be with this intelligence, Nicanor. 
 
Roman: 
The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife 
she's fallen out her husband. Your 
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
of his country.
 
Volsce:
He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
and will merrily accompany you home. 

Roman:
I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
their adversaries. Have you an army ready, you? 

Volsce: 
A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
to be on foot at an hour's warning. 

Roman:
I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the 
man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
So, well met, and your company. 
 
Volsce:
You take my part I have the most cause 
to be glad of yours.

Roman:
let us 

CORIOLANUS:
goodly city is this Antium. City, 
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
Of these fair 
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
In puny battle slay me. 
Save you, sir.

Citizen: 
And you. 

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be your will,
Where great lies: he in Antium? 
 
Citizen: 
He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
At his house this night.
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Which is his house, beseech you?
 
Citizen:
This, before 

CORIOLANUS:
Thank you, sir: farewell.
O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn, 
Whose double bosoms wear one heart, 
Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
Are still who twin, as 'twere, love 
Unseparable, shall within this hour,
On a dissension of a doit, break out 
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose passions plots have broke their sleep, 
To take the one the other, by some chance,
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
And interjoin issues. me: 
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
He does fair if he give me way, 
I'll do his country 
 
First Servingman:
Wine, wine, wine! What service
is here! I think our fellows are 
 
Second Servingman: 
Where's Cotus? my master 
for him. Cotus!

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
Appear not like a guest.

First Servingman:
What would have, friend? are you? 
Here's no place for you: pray, go to the 

CORIOLANUS:
I have deserved no better entertainment, 
being Coriolanus. 

Second Servingman:
Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
Pray, get you out. 
 
CORIOLANUS:
Away!
 
Second 
away. 

CORIOLANUS:
Now thou'rt troublesome. 
 
Second Servingman: 
Are you brave? I'll have you talked with 

Third Servingman: 
What fellow's this? 

First Servingman: 
A strange one as ever I looked I cannot him 
out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.

Servingman: 
What you to here, fellow? Pray you, avoid 
the house. 
 
CORIOLANUS:
Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.

Third Servingman: 
What are you? 

CORIOLANUS:
A gentleman. 
 
Third Servingman: 
A marvellous 

CORIOLANUS: 
True, so I am. 

Third 
Pray you, poor gentleman, take up 
station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.

CORIOLANUS: 
Follow your function, go, and batten on cold 

Third Servingman: 
What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
strange guest he has here.

Second Servingman:
And I shall.
 
Third Servingman: 
Where dwellest thou?
 
CORIOLANUS:
Under the canopy.

Third Servingman: 
Under the 

CORIOLANUS:
Ay. 

Third Servingman:
Where's that? 

CORIOLANUS:
I' the city of and crows. 

Third 
I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
Then thou dwellest with daws too?

CORIOLANUS:
No, serve not thy 
 
Third Servingman: 
sir! meddle with my master? 
 
CORIOLANUS:
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
trencher, hence! 
 
AUFIDIUS:
Where is this fellow?

Second Servingman:
sir: have beaten him like dog, but for 
disturbing the lords 
 
AUFIDIUS:
Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name? 
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?
 
CORIOLANUS: 
If, Tullus, 
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for man I necessity 
Commands me name myself.

AUFIDIUS: 
What is thy name? 
 
CORIOLANUS:
name unmusical to the Volscians' 
And harsh in sound to thine. 


Say, what's 
Thou a appearance, and thy face 
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Prepare thy brow to know'st 
thou me yet? 
 
AUFIDIUS:
I know thee not: thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto may 
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service, 
dangers and the drops of blood 
Shed for my are 
But with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst me: only that name 
The cruelty and of people, 
Permitted by our nobles, who 
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Now this 
Hath me to hearth; not out of 
Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
I would 'voided but in mere spite, 
To full quit of those banishers, 
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
Thine particular and stop those maims 
Of shame seen through thy 
thee straight, 
And my misery so it 
That my revengeful services may prove 
As benefits to for will fight 
my canker'd with the spleen 
all the under fiends. But if so be 
darest this and that to prove more fortunes 
Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.

AUFIDIUS: 
O Marcius, Marcius!
Each word spoke hath weeded from my heart 
A root of envy. If Jupiter 
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
Than thee, all Marcius. Let twine 
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here 
The of my sword, and do contest 
As hotly and nobly with thy love 
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend thy valour. Know thou first, 
I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart 
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
several times, and I have nightly 
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
We have been down together in my sleep,
helms, fisting other's throat, 
waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius, 
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into bowels ungrateful Rome, 
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in, 
And take our friendly senators by the hands;
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Who prepared against your territories, 
Though not for Rome itself.
 
CORIOLANUS: 
You bless me, 

AUFIDIUS:
Therefore, most absolute sir, wilt have 
The leading of revenges, take 
The one half of my commission; and set down--
As best thou art experienced, thou 
Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways; 
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
To them, ere destroy. come in: 
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than e'er an enemy; 
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

Servingman: 
Here's a strange alteration!

Second 
By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his made a 
false report of him.

First Servingman:
What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
 
Second Servingman:
Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
he sir, a kind of methought,--I 
cannot tell how to term it. 
 
Servingman: 
so; as it were--would I were hanged, 
but thought there was him than I could think. 
 
Servingman: 
So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest 
man i' the world.
 
Servingman: 
I he is: but a soldier you wot on. 
 
Second 
Who, master? 

Servingman: 
Nay, it's no matter for that.

Second Servingman:
Worth on him. 

First Servingman:
Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
greater soldier.

Second Servingman: 
Faith, look you, one cannot how to 
for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.

First Servingman:
Ay, and for an assault too.

Third Servingman:
O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!
 
First Servingman:
What, what, what? let's partake. 
 
Third Servingman: 
I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
lieve be a condemned man. 
 
First Servingman:
Wherefore? wherefore?

Third Servingman: 
Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general, 
Caius Marcius.

Servingman: 
Why do you 'thwack our general '? 

Servingman: 
I do say 'thwack our general;' but was 
enough for him. 

Second Servingman:
Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.

First Servingman:
He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
on't: before he scotched him and 
him like a carbon ado.

Second Servingman:
An he had been cannibally given, he might have
broiled and eaten him too.

First Servingman:
But, more of thy news? 

Third Servingman:
Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
and heir to Mars; set at o' the 
question asked him by any of the senators, but they
stand bald him: general himself makes a 
mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and 
the white o' the eye to his discourse. 
the bottom of the is that our cut i' 
the and but one half what he 
yesterday; for has half, by entreaty 
and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled. 
 
Second Servingman: 
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.

Third Servingman:
Do't! he will do't; for, look sir, he has as 
many as enemies; which as it 
were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.

First Servingman: 
Directitude! what's that?
 
Third Servingman:
But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
and the man in blood, they will out of their
burrows, like conies after revel with 
him. 

First Servingman:
But when goes this forward? 
 
Third Servingman: 
you shall have the 
drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips. 
 
Second Servingman: 
Why, then have a stirring world again. 
peace is nothing, but to rust iron, 
tailors, and breed ballad-makers.

First Servingman:
Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, 
full of vent. Peace is a lethargy; 
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
bastard children than a destroyer of men. 

Second Servingman:
'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a 
great maker of cuckolds. 
 
First Servingman:
and it makes men hate one another. 

Third Servingman: 
Reason; because they then less need one another.
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
as They are rising, they are 

All:
In, in, in, in!

SICINIUS:
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
His remedies are tame i' the present peace
quietness of which 
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see 
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions friendly. 

BRUTUS:
We to't in good time. 
this Menenius? 
 
SICINIUS:
'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of 
 
Both 
Hail sir! 

MENENIUS: 
Hail 

SICINIUS:

Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
Were he more angry at it. 
 
MENENIUS:
All's well; and might have better, if 
He could have temporized.

SICINIUS: 
Where he, hear 
 
MENENIUS: 
Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
Hear nothing from him.

Citizens:
The you both! 
 
SICINIUS: 
God-den, our neighbours. 
 
BRUTUS:
God-den to you all, god-den to you all.
 
First Citizen: 
Ourselves, wives, and children, on knees, 
Are bound to pray 

SICINIUS: 
Live, and thrive!
 
BRUTUS: 
Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Had loved you as we did.
 
Citizens:
Now the gods keep you! 

Tribunes: 
Farewell, 

SICINIUS: 
This is a and more comely time 
Than when these fellows ran about streets, 
confusion. 

BRUTUS: 
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
Self-loving,-- 
 
SICINIUS:
And affecting one sole throne, 
Without assistance.
 
MENENIUS:
I think not so. 


We should this, to all lamentation, 
If he had gone forth found it so. 
 
BRUTUS:
The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
Sits and without him. 
 
AEdile:
Worthy tribunes,
There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
Reports, the Volsces with two several powers 
Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.
 
MENENIUS:
'Tis Aufidius,
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
forth horns again into the world; 
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
And durst not once peep out.

SICINIUS: 
what you 
Of Marcius?

BRUTUS:
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot 
The Volsces dare break with us.

MENENIUS:
Cannot be! 
We record very it 
And three examples of the like have 
Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
Before you punish him, where heard this, 
Lest you shall chance to whip your information
And beat the messenger who bids beware
what is to be dreaded. 

SICINIUS: 
Tell not 
I know this cannot be.

BRUTUS:
Not possible.
 
Messenger: 
The nobles great earnestness are going 
All to senate-house: some news is come 
That turns their countenances. 

SICINIUS: 
'Tis this slave;--
Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
Nothing but his report.
 
Messenger:
Yes, worthy sir,
The slave's report seconded; and more, 
More fearful, is deliver'd. 
 
SICINIUS: 
What more fearful?

Messenger: 
It is spoke freely out many mouths-- 
How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
Join'd leads power 'gainst Rome, 
And vows as spacious as between 
The young'st and oldest thing.
 
SICINIUS:
This is most likely!
 
BRUTUS: 
Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again. 
 
SICINIUS: 
The very trick on't.

MENENIUS: 
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.
 
Messenger: 
You are sent for to the senate:
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius, rages 
Upon territories; and have already 
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
What lay before them.

COMINIUS:
O, you have made good work!


What 
 
COMINIUS:
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
melt the city leads your pates, 
To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--

MENENIUS: 
What's the news? what's the news?
 
COMINIUS: 
Your temples burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined 
Into an auger's bore.

MENENIUS: 
Pray now, your news? 
You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
If Marcius be join'd with Volscians,-- 
 
COMINIUS: 
If!
their god: he them like a thing 
Made by some other deity than nature,
That shapes man better; and they follow him,
Against us brats, with no less confidence
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Or butchers killing flies.

MENENIUS: 
You have made good work,
You and your apron-men; that up much 
on the voice of occupation and
The breath of garlic-eaters!
 
COMINIUS:
He shake 
Your Rome about your ears.

MENENIUS:
As Hercules 
Did shake down mellow fruit.
You have made fair work!
 
BRUTUS:
is this true, 

COMINIUS:
Ay; and you'll look pale
Before you find it All the regions 
smilingly revolt; who resist 
Are mock'd 
And constant Who is't blame him? 
enemies and his find in him. 

MENENIUS:
are all undone, 
The noble man mercy. 

COMINIUS:
Who shall ask it?
The cannot do't the people 
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
As those do that had deserved his hate, 
And therein show'd like enemies. 


'Tis true:
If were putting to my house the 
That should consume it, I have not the face 
To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have fair hands, 
You and your crafts! you have crafted fair! 


You have brought
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
So incapable of help.

Both Tribunes:
Say not we brought it.

MENENIUS:
How! it we? we loved but, like 
And nobles, gave way unto clusters, 
Who did hoot him out o' the city. 
 
COMINIUS: 
But I fear
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As if he were his officer: desperation
Is all the strength and defence, 
That Rome can make against them. 

MENENIUS: 
Here come the clusters. 
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
And not a hair upon a 
Which will not prove a whip: as coxcombs 
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
And pay you for your voices. no 
if he could burn us all into one coal,
We have deserved it.

Citizens: 
Faith, we hear fearful news.

Citizen: 
For mine own part,
When I banish him, I said 'twas pity. 

Second Citizen:
And did I. 

Third Citizen:
And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
it was against our will.
 
COMINIUS:
Ye re goodly things, you voices!


You have made
work, you and your cry! Shall's to Capitol? 
 
COMINIUS: 
O, ay, what 

SICINIUS: 
Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
These are a side that would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
And show no sign fear. 
 
Citizen: 
The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
him. 
 
Second 
So did we all. But, come, let's home. 

BRUTUS:
I do not this news. 

SICINIUS:
Nor I.
 
BRUTUS:
Let's to the Would half my 
buy this for a lie! 

SICINIUS:
Pray, let us go.
 
AUFIDIUS: 
Do they still fly to the Roman?


I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
Your him as the grace 'fore meat, 
talk at and thanks at end; 
And you are in this 
Even by your own.
 
AUFIDIUS:
I cannot help it now,
Unless, by using means, I the foot 
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
Even to than I would 
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
In no changeling; I excuse 
What cannot be amended. 
 
Lieutenant:
Yet wish, 
mean particular,--you had not 
Join'd in commission with him; but either
Had borne action of yourself, or else 
To him had left it solely.

AUFIDIUS:
I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
when he shall come to his account, he knows not
What I can urge against him. Although it 
And so he thinks, is no less apparent 
To the vulgar eye, that bears things fairly. 
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
Fights dragon-like, and does as soon 
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
Whene'er we come to our account. 
 
Lieutenant:
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS: 
All places yield to him he sits down; 
And the nobility of Rome are his:
The senators and patricians love him too:
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
To expel him I think he'll be to Rome 
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
sovereignty of nature. First he was 
A noble servant to them; but he could not
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride, 
Which of daily fortune ever taints 
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
To fail the disposing of those chances 
Which he lord or whether nature, 
Not to be other than one thing, not moving
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
Even same austerity and garb 
As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
As he hath spices them all, not all, 
For I so free him--made him fear'd, 
So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
Lie in the of the time: 
And power, unto itself most commendable,
Hath not a tomb evident as a 
extol what hath 
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine, 
Thou of then art thou mine. 
 
MENENIUS:
No, I'll you hear what hath said 
Which was sometime his general; who loved him
In a most dear particular. He call'd me father: 
what o' Go, you that banish'd him; 
A mile before his tent fall down, knee 
The way into nay, if he coy'd 
To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.

COMINIUS: 
He would not seem to me. 

MENENIUS: 
Do you hear? 
 
COMINIUS:
Yet one time he did call me by my name:
I urged our old acquaintance, the drops 
That we have bled together. Coriolanus 
He would not answer to: forbad all names;
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
he had forged himself a name the fire 
Of burning Rome. 

MENENIUS:
Why, so: you made good work! 
A of tribunes that have rack'd Rome, 
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!
 
COMINIUS: 
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it was expected: he replied, 
It was a bare petition of a state
whom they had punish'd. 

MENENIUS: 

Could he say less? 
 
COMINIUS: 
I offer'd awaken his regard 
For's private friends: his answer to me was,
He could not stay to pick them in a pile
Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
For poor or two, to unburnt, 
And still to nose the offence.
 
MENENIUS:
For poor or two! 
I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.

SICINIUS:
Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
In this never-needed help, yet do not 
Upbraid's our distress. But, sure, if you 
Would be country's pleader, good tongue, 
More than the instant army we can make,
Might stop our countryman.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not meddle. 

SICINIUS:
Pray you, go to him.

MENENIUS:
What should I do? 
 
BRUTUS: 
Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome, Marcius. 

MENENIUS: 
Well, and say that Marcius
Return me, as is return'd, 
Unheard; what then?
But a discontented friend, grief-shot 
With his unkindness? so? 
 
SICINIUS:
Yet your good will
must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
As you intended well.


I'll undertake 't:
I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
He was well; he had not dined: 
The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
We pout upon the morning, are unapt
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
These and these conveyances of our blood
we have suppler souls 
Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch 
Till he be dieted to my request,
And then I'll set upon him.

BRUTUS:
You know the very road into his kindness, 
And cannot lose your way. 

MENENIUS: 
Good faith, I'll him, 
Speed it will. I ere long knowledge 
Of my success.

COMINIUS:
He'll never hear him. 
 

Not?
 
COMINIUS: 
I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
So that all hope is vain. 
Unless his noble mother, and his 
Who, I hear, mean to solicit 
For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
with our fair entreaties haste on. 

First Senator:
Stay: whence are you?

Second Senator: 
Stand, back. 

MENENIUS: 
You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
an officer of and come 
To speak with Coriolanus. 

First Senator: 
From whence?
 
MENENIUS:
From Rome.

First Senator: 
You may not pass, you must return: our general
Will no more hear from thence.
 
Second Senator:
You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
You'll speak with Coriolanus.
 
MENENIUS:
Good my friends,
If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
 
First 
Be it go back: the virtue of name 
Is not here passable. 
 
MENENIUS: 
I tell thee, fellow,
The general is my lover: I have 
The book of his acts, whence men have 
name haply amplified; 
For I have ever verified my friends, 
Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground, 
I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
Have stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow, 
I must have leave to pass. 
 
First Senator:
Faith, sir, if you had told lies in his 
behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, 
always factionary on the party of your general.
 
Second 
Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
you pass. Therefore, go back. 
 
MENENIUS: 
Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
speak with him after dinner. 
 
First Senator: 
You are Roman, are you? 

MENENIUS: 
I am, as general 

First Senator:
Then you hate Rome, as Can you, 
when you pushed out your gates the very 
defender of them, and, in popular 
ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
front his revenges with the easy groans of old
women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
such weak as this? No, you are deceived; 
therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
you out of reprieve 
 
MENENIUS:
Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
use me with estimation. 

Second Senator: 
Come, my captain knows you not.


mean, thy general. 
 
First Senator:
My general cares not for you. Back, I say, lest 
I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
the utmost of your having: back. 

MENENIUS:
Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--

CORIOLANUS: 
What's the matter?
 
MENENIUS:
Now, companion, I'll say errand you: 
You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall 
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from 
my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
him, if thou standest not i' the state of 
hanging, some death long in 
spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse 
thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
thou art for thee, here's 
water to quench I was hardly moved come to 
thee; but being assured none but myself could move 
thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
The good gods assuage thy 
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
here,--this, who, like a hath denied 
access to 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Away!
 
MENENIUS: 
How! away!

CORIOLANUS:
Wife, mother, I know not. My affairs 
Are servanted to others: though I owe 
My revenge properly, my remission lies
In Volscian breasts. That have been familiar, 
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than 
Your against my force. Yet, for I loved thee, 
this along; I writ it for thy sake 
And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
I not hear thee This man, Aufidius, 
Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!


keep constant temper. 
 
First Senator:
Now, sir, is your name Menenius?

Second Senator:
'Tis a spell, you see, of power: you know the 
home again. 
 
First Senator: 
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness back? 

Second Senator:
What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?

MENENIUS:
I neither care for the nor your general: for 
things as you, I can scarce there's any, 
ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
himself fears it not from another: let your general
do his worst. For be that you are, long; and 
your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
as I was said to, Away!

First Senator:
A noble fellow, I warrant him.

Second Senator: 
worthy fellow is our general: he's rock, the 
oak not to be wind-shaken.

CORIOLANUS: 
will before the walls of Rome tomorrow 
Set down our host. My partner in this action,
must to the Volscian lords, how plainly 
I have borne this business.

AUFIDIUS:
Only their ends 
You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
general of Rome; never 
A private whisper, no, not with such friends
thought them sure of 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
This last old man, 
Whom with a crack'd heart have sent to Rome, 
Loved me above the measure of a father;
Nay, godded indeed. Their latest refuge 
Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
Though sourly him, once more offer'd 
The conditions, which did refuse 
And cannot now accept; to grace him only
That thought he could do more, a very little
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits, 
Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
the same time 'tis made? I will not. 
My wife comes foremost; the honour'd 
Wherein trunk was framed, in hand 
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
All and privilege of nature, break! 
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which can make gods forsworn? melt, and am not 
Of stronger earth than My mother 
if Olympus to a molehill 
In supplication nod: and my young boy
Hath an of intercession, 
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces 
Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never 
Be a gosling to obey instinct, but stand, 
if a man were author of himself 
And no other kin. 

VIRGILIA: 
My lord and 

CORIOLANUS:
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome. 

VIRGILIA: 
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed 
Makes you so. 
 

Like a dull actor now,
I have forgot my part, and I am out,
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but 
For that 'Forgive our O, a kiss 
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the jealous queen heaven, that kiss 
I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate, 
And most noble mother of the world 
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
Of thy deep duty more impression show
Than that of common sons.

VOLUMNIA: 
O, stand up blest! 
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
I kneel before and unproperly 
duty, as all this 
Between the child and parent. 
 
CORIOLANUS:
What is this?
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let the winds 
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
Murdering impossibility, to make 
What cannot be, slight work.
 
VOLUMNIA:
Thou art my warrior; 
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?

CORIOLANUS: 
The noble sister of Publicola,
The of Rome, chaste as icicle 
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow 
And hangs on Dian's temple: Valeria! 
 
VOLUMNIA:
This is a poor epitome of yours,
Which by the interpretation of full time
May show like all yourself.
 
CORIOLANUS:
The god of soldiers,
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' wars 
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
And saving those that eye thee! 

VOLUMNIA:
Your knee, sirrah.
 
CORIOLANUS: 
That's my brave boy! 

VOLUMNIA:
Even your wife, this lady, and myself, 
Are suitors to you.

CORIOLANUS: 
I beseech you, 
Or, if you'ld remember this 
thing I have forsworn to grant 
held by you denials. bid me 
my soldiers, or capitulate 
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
Wherein I desire not 
To ally my rages and revenges with 
Your colder reasons. 

VOLUMNIA:
O, no more, no more!
You have you will not grant us thing; 
For we have nothing else to ask, but that
Which deny already: yet we ask; 
That, if you fail in our request, the blame
May upon your hardness: hear us. 

CORIOLANUS: 
Aufidius, and you mark; we'll 
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?

VOLUMNIA: 
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment 
And state of bodies would bewray what life
We led since thy exile. Think with thyself 
How more unfortunate than all living women 
we come hither: since that thy sight, 
which should 
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts 
with 
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
Making the mother, wife and child to 
The the husband and the father tearing 
country's bowels out. And to we 
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
That all but we enjoy; for how we, 
Alas, can for our country pray. 
we bound, together with thy victory, 
Whereto we bound? alack, or we must lose 
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person, 
Our comfort in the country. must find 
An evident calamity, though we had 
Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
With manacles thorough our streets, or else
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
And bear the for having bravely 
wife children's blood. myself, son, 
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
to show noble to both 
seek the end of one, thou shalt no 
March thy country to tread-- 
Trust thou shalt thy mother's womb, 
That brought thee to this world.
 

Ay, and mine, 
brought you forth this boy, to keep your name 
Living to time. 
 
Young MARCIUS: 
A' shall not tread on me; 
I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.
 
CORIOLANUS:
Not of a woman's tenderness to be, 
Requires nor nor woman's see. 
too long. 

VOLUMNIA: 
Nay, go not from us 
If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
poisonous your honour: our suit 
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
May say we have show'd;' Romans, 
we received;' and each in either side 
Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
Whose repetition be dogg'd with 
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
But with last attempt he wiped it out; 
Destroy'd his country, and his 
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
the graces of the 
To tear with thunder wide cheeks o' the air, 
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
should rive an oak. dost not 
Think'st thou it honourable for a man 
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
He cares not your weeping. thou, 
Perhaps childishness move more 
can our There's no in the 
More to 's mother; yet me prate 
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never life 
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
When poor hen, fond no second brood, 
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
with honour. Say my request's 
spurn me back: but if it not 
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away: 
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
This is the last: so will home to 
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have 
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship, 
Does reason our petition with more strength
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go: 
This had a Volscian to mother; 
His wife is in Corioli and his child
Like him by chance. Yet give us dispatch: 
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
And then speak a little. 

CORIOLANUS: 
O mother! 
What have you done? Behold, heavens do ope, 
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene 
They my mother, O! 
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But, your son,--believe it, O, believe it, 
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars, 
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius, 
Were you in my stead, would you have heard
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?

AUFIDIUS: 
I was moved withal.

CORIOLANUS:
I dare be sworn you were:
And, sir, it is no little thing make 
eyes to sweat But, good sir, 
What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
I'll not to Rome, back with you; and you, 
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
 
AUFIDIUS:

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, by and by;
But we will drink together; and you shall bear
A back than which we, 
On like conditions, have 
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
To have a temple built you: all the swords
In Italy, her arms, 
Could not have made this peace. 
 
MENENIUS:
See you yond o' the Capitol, 

 
SICINIUS:
Why, what of that?

MENENIUS: 
it be possible for you to it with your 
little finger, there some the of 
Rome, especially his mother, prevail with 
But I say there is no in't: throats are 
sentenced and stay upon execution.
 
SICINIUS: 
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man!
 

is differency between a grub and a butterfly; 
yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
man to dragon: he has more than a 
creeping thing.

SICINIUS: 
He loved his mother dearly. 
 
MENENIUS:
So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother 
now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before 
his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for 
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne in.
 
SICINIUS: 
Yes, mercy, if you him truly. 
 
MENENIUS:
the character. Mark what mercy 
shall bring from him: there is more mercy 
in than there is in that 
shall poor city find: and all long of 
you. 
 
SICINIUS: 
The be us! 
 
MENENIUS:
No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
us. When banished him, we respected not them; 
and, he returning break our they respect not us. 

Messenger: 
Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house: 
The have got 
And him up and 
Roman ladies bring not home, 
They'll give him death by inches.

SICINIUS:
What's the news?
 
Second Messenger:
Good news, good news; the have prevail'd, 
Volscians dislodged, and Marcius gone: 
A day did never Rome, 
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
 
SICINIUS:
Friend, 
Art certain this is true? is it certain? 
 
Second Messenger: 
As certain I know sun is 
have you lurk'd, that you of it? 
Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
As the recomforted through the gates. Why, 
The trumpets, sackbuts, and fifes, 
Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
Make the sun dance. Hark you!
 
MENENIUS: 
This is good news:
I will go the ladies. This Volumnia 
worth of consuls, senators, patricians, 
A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
morning for ten thousand of 
I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they 
 
SICINIUS: 
First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
Accept my thankfulness. 

Second Messenger: 
Sir, we have all
cause to give great thanks. 

SICINIUS:
They are city? 

Second 
Almost at point to enter.

SICINIUS:
We will meet them,
And help the joy.
 
First Senator:
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
And triumphant fires; strew flowers before them: 
the noise that banish'd Marcius, 
Repeal him with the of mother; 
Cry welcome!' 
 
All: 
Welcome, Welcome! 
 
AUFIDIUS:
Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
Deliver them this paper: having read it,
Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
and in the commons' ears, 
Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Intends appear before hoping 
To purge herself with words: dispatch.
Most welcome!

First Conspirator:
How is our general? 

AUFIDIUS:
Even so
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
with his charity 

Second Conspirator:
Most noble sir,
If you do hold the same intent wherein
You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
Of your great danger.

AUFIDIUS:
Sir, I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do find the people.
 
Third Conspirator:
The people will remain uncertain whilst
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of 
the survivor heir of all. 

AUFIDIUS:
I know it; 
And strike at him 
A good construction. I him, and I pawn'd 
honour his truth: being so heighten'd, 
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
his nature, never before 
be rough, unswayable and free. 

Third Conspirator:
his stoutness 
When he did stand for consul, which he lost
By lack of stooping,--

AUFIDIUS:
That I would have spoke of: 
Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
In all his own desires; nay, him choose 
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
My and freshest designments 
In mine own holp to reap the fame 
Which he did end all his; and took some pride
To do myself this wrong: till, at the last, 
I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
He waged me with his countenance, as if
I had been mercenary.

First Conspirator: 
So did, my 
The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last, 
When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
For no less spoil than glory,--

AUFIDIUS: 
was it: 
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold blood and labour 
Of our great action: therefore shall he die, 
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!

First Conspirator: 
Your native town you enter'd like a post,
And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
Splitting the air with noise.
 
Second Conspirator: 
And patient fools,
Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
With giving him glory.

Third Conspirator:
Therefore, at your vantage,
Ere he express himself, or move the people
With what he would feel your sword, 
Which we will second. When he lies along,
After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
His reasons with his body.

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more: 
Here come the 

All The Lords:
You are most welcome 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
I have not deserved it.
But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
What have written to you? 
 
Lords:
We have.

First Lord: 
And grieve to hear't. 
What faults he made before the last, I think
Might have found easy fines: but there to end
Where he was begin and give away 
The benefit of our levies, answering us
With our own charge, making a treaty where
There was a yielding,--this admits excuse. 

AUFIDIUS:
you shall hear 
 
CORIOLANUS: 
Hail, lords! return'd your soldier, 
No more infected with my country's love
Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
Under your great command. You are to know
That prosperously I have attempted and
With bloody passage led wars even to 
The gates of Our spoils we have brought home 
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
The charges of action. have 
With no less honour to the Antiates
Than to the Romans: and we here deliver, 
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
Together with the seal o' the senate, what
We have compounded on.

AUFIDIUS: 
Read it not, noble lords;
But tell traitor, in the degree 
He hath abused your powers. 


Traitor! how now!

AUFIDIUS: 
Ay, traitor, Marcius!

CORIOLANUS:
Marcius! 

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
Coriolanus in Corioli?
You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
He betray'd your business, and given 
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A of rotten silk, never 
Counsel the war, but at his nurse's tears 
He whined and roar'd away your victory,
pages blush'd at him and men of heart 
Look'd wondering each at other.

CORIOLANUS: 
Hear'st thou, 
 
AUFIDIUS:
Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS:
Ha!

AUFIDIUS:
No more. 
 
CORIOLANUS:
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords, 
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.

First Lord:
both, and hear me speak. 

CORIOLANUS: 
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all edges on me. Boy! hound! 
If you have writ your 'tis 
That, an eagle in a dove-cote, I 
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Alone I did it. Boy! 

AUFIDIUS:
Why, noble lords,
Will you be put in mind his blind fortune, 
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart, 
'Fore your own eyes and ears? 

All Conspirators: 
Let him die 
 
All The People: 
'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' kill'd 
my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'

Second Lord:
Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
The man is noble and his folds-in 
This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
And not the peace. 

CORIOLANUS:
O that I had him,
six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe, 
To my lawful sword! 
 
AUFIDIUS: 
Insolent villain!

All Conspirators:
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
 
Lords: 
Hold, hold, hold, hold!
 
AUFIDIUS: 
My noble masters, hear me 

First Lord:
O Tullus,-- 

Second Lord:
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
 
Third Lord:
Tread not upon him. Masters all, be 
Put up your swords.
 
AUFIDIUS:
My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
Provoked by you cannot--the danger 
Which man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice 
That he thus it your honours 
To call me to your senate, I'll deliver 
Myself your loyal servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure.
 
First Lord: 
Bear hence his body; 
And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
As the most noble corse that ever herald
follow to his urn. 

Second Lord: 
own impatience 
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Let's make the best of it.

AUFIDIUS: 
My rage is gone;
And I struck with sorrow. Take him up. 
Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this he 
Hath widow'd unchilded many a 
Which hour bewail the injury, 
Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.


Now is winter of our discontent 
Made glorious summer by this sun of York; 
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In deep bosom of the ocean buried. 
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to meetings, 
Our dreadful marches to 
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, of mounting barded steeds 
To the souls of adversaries, 
He nimbly in a lady's chamber 
To lascivious a lute. 
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
that am rudely stamp'd, and love's majesty 
To strut before a wanton ambling 
that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, 
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time 
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, 
And so lamely and unfashionable 
That dogs at as by them; 
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in sun 
descant mine own 
And therefore, since I cannot prove a 
entertain these fair well-spoken days, 
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate idle pleasures these days. 
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the against the 
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am false and treacherous, 
This should Clarence closely be mew'd up, 
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
Clarence comes. 
good day; means this 
That waits upon your grace?
 
CLARENCE: 
His majesty
Tendering my person's safety, hath 
This conduct to convey me to the Tower. 
 
GLOUCESTER:
Upon what cause?

CLARENCE:
Because my name is George.

GLOUCESTER:
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
O, belike his majesty hath some intent
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?

CLARENCE: 
Yea, Richard, I know; for I protest 
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams; 
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
And says wizard told him that 
His issue disinherited should 
And, for my name of George begins with G,
It follows in his thought that I am he. 
These, as learn, such like toys as these 
Have moved his to commit me now. 

GLOUCESTER:
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
'Tis not the king you to Tower: 
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
From whence this present day is deliver'd? 
not Clarence; we are not safe. 

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I no man is secure 
But the queen's and night-walking heralds 
That trudge betwixt the king and 
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
hastings was to for his delivery? 
 
GLOUCESTER:
Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty. 
I'll tell what; think it is 
If we will keep in favour with the king, 
To be her men wear her livery: 
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
 
BRAKENBURY: 
I beseech graces both to me; 
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference,
Of what degree soever, with 

GLOUCESTER:
Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury, 
You may partake of any thing we say: 
We no treason, man: we say the king 
Is wise and virtuous, and noble queen 
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny a passing pleasing tongue; 
And that queen's kindred are made gentle-folks: 
How sir? Can you deny this? 

BRAKENBURY:
With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
 
GLOUCESTER:
Naught to do with I tell thee, fellow, 
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
Were best he do it secretly, alone.
 
BRAKENBURY: 
What one, my lord?

GLOUCESTER: 
Her knave: wouldst thou betray me? 

BRAKENBURY:
beseech your to me, withal 
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
 

We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

GLOUCESTER:
We are queen's abjects, and must obey. 
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
And whatsoever you will employ me in,
Were it to call King Edward's 
will it to enfranchise you. 
deep disgrace in brotherhood 
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.

CLARENCE: 
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

GLOUCESTER:
Well, your imprisonment shall be long; 
Meantime, have patience.
 
CLARENCE:
I must perforce. Farewell.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, tread that thou shalt ne'er return. 
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so, 
That I shortly send thy soul heaven, 
heaven take the present at our hands. 
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?

HASTINGS:
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
 

As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
Well are you welcome to the air. 
How your lordship brook'd imprisonment? 
 

With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
That were of my 

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
For they that were your enemies are his,
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
 
HASTINGS: 
pity that the eagle should be mew'd, 
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
news abroad? 
 
HASTINGS:
No news so bad abroad as this at home;
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
his physicians fear mightily. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Now, by Paul, this news indeed. 
O, he kept an evil diet long, 
And overmuch consumed his royal person:
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
What, is he in his bed?

HASTINGS:
He is.

GLOUCESTER:
Go you before, and I will follow you.
He live, I and must not die 
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
Clarence hath not another day to live:
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
And the world for bustle in! 
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
What though I husband and her father? 
The readiest way to the wench 
Is to become her husband and her father:
The which will I; not all so for love 
As for another secret close intent, 
By marrying I reach unto. 
But yet I my horse to market: 
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
are gone, then must I gains. 
 
ANNE: 
Set down, set down honourable load, 
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
I awhile obsequiously 
The untimely fall virtuous Lancaster. 
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster! 
Thou remnant of royal 
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
hear the lamentations Poor Anne, 
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made wounds! 
in these that let forth thy life, 
I helpless balm of poor eyes. 
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
More hap that hated wretch, 
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
If ever he have child, abortive be it,
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
And be heir to his unhappiness! 
If ever wife, let her made 
A miserable by the death of him
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
And still, as you are weary of the weight,
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.

GLOUCESTER: 
you that bear the corse, and it 
 
LADY ANNE:
What black magician conjures up this 
To stop devoted charitable 

GLOUCESTER: 
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
I'll make a corse of that disobeys. 
 
Gentleman:
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin 
 
GLOUCESTER:
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
Advance thy halbert higher than my 
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
thee, beggar, for thy boldness. 

LADY ANNE:
What, are you all 
you for are mortal, 
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell! 
Thou hadst but power over mortal 
soul thou not have; be gone. 

GLOUCESTER: 
Sweet saint, for charity, be not curst. 

LADY ANNE:
Foul for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not; 
For thou hast made earth thy hell, 
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds 
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
O which this blood drink'st revenge his death! 
Either heaven with lightning strike the 
murderer dead,
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know no rules of charity,
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses. 
 
LADY ANNE:
Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man: 
beast but knows some touch of 

GLOUCESTER: 
But I none, and therefore am no beast. 

LADY ANNE:
wonderful, when devils tell the truth! 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
More wonderful, when angels are so angry. 
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
By circumstance, but to acquit myself. 

LADY ANNE: 
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
For known to give me 
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.

GLOUCESTER: 
than tongue can thee, let me have 
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

GLOUCESTER: 
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
doing worthy vengeance on thyself, 
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

GLOUCESTER:
Say that I slew 

LADY ANNE: 
Why, then they are not dead:
But dead are, and devilish slave, by thee. 

GLOUCESTER:
I did not kill your husband.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then he is alive.

GLOUCESTER:
Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.

LADY ANNE: 
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
The which thou once didst bend against her breast, 
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
 

I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
which their guiltless shoulders. 
 
LADY ANNE: 
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind. 
Which never dreamt on aught but 
Didst thou not kill this king?

GLOUCESTER: 
I grant ye. 

LADY ANNE:
then, God grant me too 
Thou be for that deed! 
he was mild, and 

GLOUCESTER:
The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
 
LADY ANNE:
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
 
GLOUCESTER:
Let him me, that holp to thither; 
For he was fitter that than earth. 

LADY ANNE: 
And thou unfit for any place but hell.

GLOUCESTER:
Yes, one else, if you will hear me name it. 

LADY ANNE:
Some dungeon.
 

Your bed-chamber. 

LADY ANNE:
I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!

GLOUCESTER:
So will madam I lie with you. 
 
LADY ANNE:
hope so. 

GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To this encounter of our wits, 
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not causer of the deaths 
Of Henry and Edward, 
As as the executioner? 


Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect. 

GLOUCESTER: 
Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Your beauty: which did haunt in my sleep 
To undertake the death of all the 
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.

LADY ANNE: 
I thought that, I tell homicide, 
These nails should rend that beauty from cheeks. 

GLOUCESTER:
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
You not blemish it, if I stood by: 
As all world is by the sun, 
So I by that; it is my day, my life.
 
LADY ANNE:
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!

GLOUCESTER: 
Curse thyself, fair thou art both. 
 
ANNE: 
I I were, to be on thee. 

GLOUCESTER:
is a quarrel most 
To be revenged on him that loveth you.
 
ANNE: 
It is a quarrel just and reasonable, 
To be on him that slew my 
 
GLOUCESTER:
He bereft thee, lady, of thy husband, 
Did it to help thee to a better husband.
 
LADY ANNE:
His better doth not breathe upon the earth. 

GLOUCESTER: 
He lives that loves thee better than he could. 
 
LADY ANNE:
Name him.

GLOUCESTER:
Plantagenet. 
 
LADY ANNE:
Why, was he. 

GLOUCESTER:
selfsame name, one of better nature. 
 
LADY ANNE:
Where is 
 
GLOUCESTER:
Here.
Why dost spit me? 
 
LADY ANNE:
it were mortal poison, for thy sake! 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Never poison from so sweet a 

LADY 
Never hung on a fouler 
of thou dost infect my eyes. 
 

Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

ANNE: 
they were basilisks, strike thee dead! 
 
GLOUCESTER:
I they were, that I might die at once; 
For now they kill with a living death. 
Those of thine from drawn salt tears, 
Shamed their aspect with store childish drops: 
never shed remorseful tear, 
my father York and Edward wept, 
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-faced Clifford shook at him; 
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
Told the sad story of my father's death,
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
That all the had wet their 
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time 
My manly eyes did scorn an tear; 
And what these sorrows could exhale, 
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word; 
But now thy beauty proposed my fee, 
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
For kissing, lady, not for contempt. 
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword; 
Which if thou please to in this 
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
lay it to the deadly stroke, 
And humbly death upon my knee. 
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
But 'twas thy face that set me on. 
Take up the sword again, or take up me.

LADY ANNE:
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death, 
I will not be the executioner. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
 
LADY ANNE:
I have already. 

GLOUCESTER: 
Tush, that was in thy rage:
Speak it again, and, even with the word,
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
To both their thou shalt be accessary. 
 
LADY ANNE: 
I would I knew heart. 

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis figured in my tongue. 

LADY ANNE: 
I fear me are false. 
 

Then never man was true.
 
LADY ANNE:
Well, well, put up your sword. 

GLOUCESTER:
Say, then, my peace is made.
 
LADY ANNE: 
That you know hereafter. 

GLOUCESTER:
But shall I live in hope?

LADY ANNE:
All men, I hope, live so.

GLOUCESTER: 
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
 
LADY ANNE:
To take is not to give.
 
GLOUCESTER:
Look, how this ring encompasseth finger. 
Even so breast my poor 
both them, for both of thine. 
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
confirm his happiness ever. 

LADY ANNE:
What is it?
 
GLOUCESTER:
That would please leave these sad designs 
To him that hath more to be a mourner, 
And presently repair to Crosby Place;
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
his grave with repentant tears, 
I will with all expedient duty see you:
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you, 
this boon. 

LADY ANNE:
all my much it me too, 
To see you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Bid me farewell.

LADY ANNE: 
more you deserve; 
But since you teach me how to flatter you,
Imagine have said farewell already. 

GLOUCESTER:
Sirs, take up corse. 

GENTLEMEN: 
Towards Chertsey, noble lord? 

GLOUCESTER:
No, to White-Friars; there attend 
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
her; but I will keep her long. 
What! that kill'd her and his father, 
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
The bleeding witness of hatred by; 
Having God, her conscience, and these bars
me, 
And I nothing to back my suit at all, 
But the plain and looks, 
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing! 
Ha! 
Hath forgot that brave prince, 
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman, 
Framed in the 
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious world cannot again afford
And she yet debase her eyes on me, 
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
And made her to a woful bed? 
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
me, that halt and unshapen 
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
I do mistake my person all this while:
Upon my life, she although I 
Myself to a marvellous proper 
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass, 
And some score or of tailors, 
To study fashions to adorn my body:
Since I am crept in favour with myself,
Will it with some 
first turn yon fellow in his grave; 
And return to my love. 
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as I pass.

RIVERS: 
Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
 
GREY: 
In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
for sake, entertain good 
cheer his grace with quick merry 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
If he were dead, what would betide of me? 

RIVERS: 
No other harm but loss of such a lord.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
loss such a lord includes all harm. 

GREY:
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
To be your comforter when he is gone.

QUEEN 
Oh, he is and his 
Is put unto the trust of Gloucester, 
A that loves not me, nor of you. 

RIVERS:
Is it concluded that he shall be protector?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
determined, not concluded yet: 
it must be, if king 
 
GREY: 
Here the lords of Buckingham and 

BUCKINGHAM: 
time of day unto your royal grace! 
 
DERBY: 
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby. 
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
 
DERBY:
I do beseech you, either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
Or, if she be in true report, 
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
wayward sickness, and no grounded malice. 

RIVERS: 
Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
 
DERBY: 
But the Duke of and I 
come visiting his 

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
 
BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
grant health! Did you confer with him? 

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, we did: he to make atonement 
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
And them and my lord chamberlain; 
And sent to warn them royal presence. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Would all were well! but that will never be
I fear our happiness is at the highest.

GLOUCESTER: 
They do wrong, and I will not endure it: 
Who are they that complain unto the king,
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love 
By holy they love his but lightly 
fill his ears with such dissentious rumours. 
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair, 
in faces, smooth, deceive and cog, 
with French nods apish courtesy, 
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
But thus his simple truth must be abused
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?

RIVERS: 
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?

GLOUCESTER: 
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
Or thee? or thee? or any of faction? 
A plague upon you all! His royal 
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
Cannot be quiet breathing-while, 
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints. 


Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
The king, of his own royal disposition,
not any suitor else; 
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
Which your outward actions shows itself 
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself, 
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it. 

GLOUCESTER: 
I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
That make prey where eagles dare not perch: 
Since Jack became a gentleman 
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
come, we know meaning, brother 
Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and my friends':
God grant we never may have need of you!

GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, God grants that we have need you: 
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
disgraced, and the nobility 
Held in fair promotions 
Are given ennoble those 
That since, worth a noble. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By Him raised me to this 
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd, 
I never did incense his majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
My lord, you do me shameful injury,
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

GLOUCESTER:
You may deny that you were the cause 
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

RIVERS: 
may, my lord, for-- 

GLOUCESTER:
She Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so? 
She may do more, sir, than denying that:
She may you to many fair 
And then deny aiding hand therein, 
And lay those honours on your high deserts.
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--

RIVERS: 
marry, may 

GLOUCESTER:
What, may with a king, 
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
I wis your grandam a worser match. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
With those gross taunts I often have endured.
I had rather be a country servant-maid
Than a great queen, with this condition,
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
Small joy have I in being England's queen. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
Thy honour, state seat is due to me. 

GLOUCESTER: 
What! threat you me with of king? 
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king:
I adventure be to the Tower. 
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
I them too well: 
Thou slewest my husband Henry the Tower, 
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury. 

GLOUCESTER:
Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
I a pack-horse in his great affairs; 
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal of his 
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.

GLOUCESTER: 
In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for house of Lancaster; 
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
What you have been ere now, and what you are;
what I and what I am. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.


Poor did father, Warwick; 
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Which God revenge!

GLOUCESTER:
To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
I am too childish-foolish for this world.

QUEEN MARGARET:
to hell for shame, and leave the 
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom 
 
RIVERS: 
My Lord of Gloucester, those days 
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
We follow'd then our lord, our king: 
So should we you, if you should be our king.

GLOUCESTER: 
If I be! I had rather be pedlar: 
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!

ELIZABETH: 
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
As little joy may you suppose in me.
That I being the queen 
 
MARGARET: 
A joy enjoys the queen 
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.
Hear me, wrangling pirates, that fall out 
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
Which of you trembles not that looks on me? 
If that, being queen, bow subjects, 
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
O gentle villain, do not turn away!

GLOUCESTER:
Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
 
QUEEN 
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
That will make before I let thee go. 

GLOUCESTER: 
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?

MARGARET: 
but I do find more pain in banishment 
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband and a son thou owest me; 
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
 
GLOUCESTER:
curse my noble father laid on 
thou didst crown his warlike brows with 
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
And God, not hath plagued thy bloody deed. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So just is God, to right the innocent.
 
HASTINGS:
'twas the foulest deed to slay babe, 
And the merciless that e'er was heard of! 
 
RIVERS: 
wept when it was reported. 

DORSET:
No man revenge for 

BUCKINGHAM: 
then present, wept to see 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
What were you snarling all I came, 
Ready to other by the 
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse so much with heaven? 
death, my lovely death, 
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
As by murder, to him a king! 
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
For Edward my son, which of Wales, 
Die in his youth by like violence! 
Thyself a for that was a queen, 
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self! 
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
And see another, as I now, 
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine! 
Long thy happy days before thy death; 
many lengthen'd hours of grief, 
Die neither mother, wife, nor queen! 
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
And so thou, Lord my son 
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
none you live your natural 
But some unlook'd accident cut off! 
 
GLOUCESTER:
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

QUEEN MARGARET: 
leave thee? stay, dog, for shalt hear me. 
If heaven have any grievous plague in store 
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
O, let them keep it till thy sins ripe, 
And then hurl down their indignation 
On thee, the troubler of poor world's 
The worm conscience still thy soul! 
Thy for traitors while thou livest, 
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
No sleep up that deadly eye of thine, 
Unless be whilst some tormenting dream 
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
elvish-mark'd, rooting hog! 
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
Thou rag of honour! thou detested-- 

GLOUCESTER:
Margaret.

QUEEN 


GLOUCESTER: 
Ha! 

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call thee not. 

GLOUCESTER: 
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought 
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter 

QUEEN MARGARET:
so I did; but look'd for reply. 
O, let me make the period to my curse!

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
 

Thus have you your curse yourself. 

QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! whet'st a knife to 
time will come when thou shalt wish me 
To help that poisonous bunchback'd toad. 

HASTINGS: 
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Foul shame upon you! you have mine. 
 

Were you well served, would taught your duty. 

QUEEN MARGARET: 
To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
O, well, and teach yourselves that duty! 

DORSET: 
not with her; she lunatic. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, master you are 
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
O, that young nobility could 
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
They that stand high have many blasts them; 
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
 
GLOUCESTER:
Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.


It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.

GLOUCESTER: 
Yea, and much but I was born so 
Our buildeth in the cedar's top, 
And dallies with the wind and the sun. 

QUEEN MARGARET:
And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
my son, in of death; 
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery in our aery's 
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
As it was won with be it so! 

BUCKINGHAM: 
Have done! for shame, if not for charity. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
with me have you dealt, 
And by are butcher'd. 
My charity is outrage, life my shame
And that shame live my rage. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Have done, have done.
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
O princely I'll thy hand, 
In sign of league and amity with 
Now fair thee and thy house! 
Thy garments with our 
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.

QUEEN MARGARET: 
not believe but they the sky, 
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
when he he bites; and when he bites, 
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
Have not to do with him, beware of him;
Sin, death, hell have set their marks on him, 
their ministers attend on him. 

GLOUCESTER: 
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
dost thou scorn me for my gentle 
And soothe devil I warn thee from? 
O, but remember this another day, 
When he shall split very sorrow, 
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
 
HASTINGS: 
My doth stand on end to hear her curses. 

RIVERS:
And so doth I muse why she's liberty. 

GLOUCESTER: 
I cannot blame her: holy mother, 
She hath had too much wrong; and repent 
My part thereof that I have done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did her any, to my knowledge.

GLOUCESTER:
But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was to do good, 
That too in thinking of it 
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
frank'd up fatting his 
God pardon them that are the cause of it!
 
RIVERS: 
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
pray for them that have scathe to us. 
 
GLOUCESTER:
So do I ever:
being well-advised.
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
 
CATESBY: 
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.

QUEEN 
Catesby, we Lords, you go with us? 

RIVERS: 
Madam, we will attend your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach 
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gulls 
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
And say it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
To Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: 
But I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture, 
Tell them God bids do good for evil: 
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
But, soft! here come my executioners.
How now, my stout resolved mates! 
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
 
First Murderer:
We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
That we may be admitted where he 
 
GLOUCESTER:
thought I have it here about me. 
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
Withal obdurate, hear him plead; 
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.

First Murderer:
Tush! 
Fear not, my lord, we will stand to prate; 
Talkers are no good doers: be assured
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.

GLOUCESTER:
Your eyes millstones, when eyes drop tears: 
I like you, lads; about your business straight;
Go, 

First Murderer: 
We will, noble 

BRAKENBURY:
Why so heavily today? 

CLARENCE: 
O, I have a miserable night, 
full of ugly sights, of 
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend such night, 
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the 

BRAKENBURY:
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
 
CLARENCE:
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy; 
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
And cited a fearful times, 
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we paced along 
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that and, in falling, 
Struck me, that thought stay him, overboard, 
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
What noise of waters in mine 
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
thousand that fishes gnaw'd upon; 
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps pearl, 
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in holes 
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As in eyes, reflecting gems, 
Which woo'd the bottom of the deep, 
And mock'd the dead bones that scatter'd by. 

BRAKENBURY: 
Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?

CLARENCE:
Methought I and often did I strive 
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul, and not let it forth 
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
But smother'd it within my panting bulk, 
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
 
BRAKENBURY:
Awaked you not with this sore agony?


O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy 
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night. 
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick; 
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy false 
And so he vanish'd: then wandering by 
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
Seize on Furies, take him your torments!' 
With that, methoughts, a legion foul fiends 
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears 
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
I trembling waked, and for a season after 
Could believe but that I was in hell, 
Such impression made the dream. 


No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
promise, I afraid to hear you tell it. 
 

O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
Which now bear evidence against my soul, 
For Edward's sake; and see how he me! 
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee, 
But wilt avenged on my misdeeds, 
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my wife and poor children! 
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
 
BRAKENBURY:
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night. 
Princes have but their tides for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward toil;
And, for unfelt imagination,
They feel a world of restless cares: 
So their tides low 
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
 
First Murderer:
Ho! here? 

BRAKENBURY: 
In God's name what are came hither? 

First Murderer: 
would speak with Clarence, and I came my legs. 
 
BRAKENBURY: 
Yea, so brief? 

Murderer: 
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
him our commission; talk no more.

BRAKENBURY: 
am, in this, commanded to deliver 
noble Duke of your hands: 
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
I will be guiltless of the 
Here the keys, there sits asleep: 
I'll the king; and signify to him 
That I resign'd charge to you. 

Murderer: 
Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.

Second Murderer:
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?

First Murderer: 
No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.

Second Murderer:
When he wakes! why, he shall never wake till 
the judgment-day.

First Murderer:
Why, then he will we stabbed sleeping. 
 
Second Murderer:
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
in me. 

First Murderer:
What, art thou afraid?

Second Murderer:
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
for from which no warrant can defend us. 

First Murderer: 
I thought thou hadst resolute. 

Second Murderer:
So I to let him 

First Murderer: 
Back to the Duke Gloucester, tell him so. 

Second Murderer:
I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty. 

First Murderer: 
How dost thou feel thyself now?
 
Second 
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
me. 
 
First Murderer:
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
 
Second Murderer:
'Zounds, he dies: had forgot the reward. 

First 
Where is thy conscience now?
 
Second Murderer: 
In Duke Gloucester's 
 
Murderer: 
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
thy conscience flies out.

Second Murderer: 
it there's few or none will entertain it. 

First Murderer:
How if it come to thee again? 
 
Second Murderer:
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
makes a man a coward: cannot steal, but it 
accuseth he swear, but it cheques him; 
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
it. 

First Murderer: 
'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
not to the duke. 

Second Murderer:
Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
would insinuate with thee but to make sigh. 

First 
Tut, I am he cannot prevail with 
I warrant thee.

Second Murderer: 
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation. shall we 

First Murderer:
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
sword, and then we chop him in the malmsey-butt 
in next room. 
 
Second Murderer:
O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
 
First Murderer:
Hark! he stirs: shall I 

Second Murderer:
No, first let's reason with him.

CLARENCE:
Where thou, give me a cup of wine. 

Second murderer:
shall have my anon. 
 
CLARENCE:
In God's name, what art thou?

Second Murderer: 
A man, as you are. 
 
CLARENCE:
But not, as I am, royal.

Second Murderer:
Nor you, as we are, loyal.
 
CLARENCE:
Thy voice thunder, but looks are humble. 
 
Second Murderer:
voice is now the king's, mine own. 
 
CLARENCE:
darkly and how deadly dost thou speak! 
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?


To, to, to--

CLARENCE: 
murder me? 
 
Both:
Ay, ay.

CLARENCE:
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Wherein, 

First Murderer: 
Offended us you have not, but the king. 

CLARENCE:
I shall be reconciled to him again.

Second Murderer: 
Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
 
CLARENCE: 
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
Where are the evidence that do accuse me? 
What lawful quest have given their up 
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of Clarence' death? 
Before I be convict by course law, 
threaten me death is most 
I charge you, as you hope to redemption 
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
That you and lay no hands on me 
The deed undertake is damnable. 

First Murderer:
What we will do, we do upon command.

Second Murderer:
And he that hath commanded is the king.

CLARENCE: 
Erroneous the great King of kings 
Hath in the of his law commanded 
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
Spurn at edict a man's? 
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
 
Murderer: 
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
For false forswearing and for murder too:
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
To fight in the house of Lancaster. 
 
First Murderer: 
And, like a traitor to the name of God,
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
Unrip'dst of thy sovereign's son. 

Second Murderer:
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.

First 
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?

CLARENCE: 
Alas! whose sake did I ill deed? 
For Edward, my brother, for sake: Why, 
He sends ye not to murder me for this
For this sin he as deep as I. 
If God will be revenged for this deed.
O, you yet, he doth 
Take not the quarrel from powerful 
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off those that have offended him.

Murderer: 
Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
 
CLARENCE: 
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
 
First Murderer: 
Thy brother's love, our duty, thy fault, 
Provoke hither now to slaughter 


Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who shall reward you better for 
Than Edward will for of my death. 
 
Second Murderer:
are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you. 

CLARENCE:
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
Go you to him me. 
 
Both: 
Ay, so we will. 

CLARENCE:
Tell him, when that princely York 
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
And charged us from soul to love each other, 
He little thought of this divided friendship:
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.


Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd to weep. 
 
CLARENCE:
O, him, kind. 
 
First 
Right,
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself: 
'Tis he that to 

CLARENCE:
It cannot be; for when I parted with 
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
That he would labour my delivery. 
 
Second Murderer:
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee 
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
 
First Murderer: 
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.

CLARENCE:
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
To counsel to make my peace with God, 
art yet to thy own soul so 
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
Ah, consider, that set on 
To do this deed will hate for the deed. 

Second Murderer:
What shall we do? 

CLARENCE:
Relent, and save your souls.

First Murderer:
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.

CLARENCE:
Not to relent beastly, savage, devilish. 
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
Being pent liberty, as I am now, 
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you, 
not entreat for life? 
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
Come thou on side, and entreat for me, 
As you would beg, were you in my distress
A begging prince beggar pities 
 
Second Murderer:
Look behind you, lord. 

First Murderer:
Take that, and if all this will do, 
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.

Second Murderer:
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!

First Murderer:
now! what mean'st that thou me 
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!

Second Murderer: 
he knew that I had saved his 
Take the fee, and tell him I say; 
For I repent me that the is slain. 

First Murderer: 
So not I: go, coward as thou art. 
Now must I hide his body in some hole,
Until the duke take order for his burial:
And when I have my meed, I must away;
For this will out, and here I must stay. 

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
continue this united league: 
I every day expect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem 
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth. 
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.

RIVERS:
By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate: 
And with my I my true love. 

HASTINGS:
So thrive I, as truly the 

KING IV: 
Take heed you dally not before your king; 
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
Either of you to be the other's 

HASTINGS: 
So prosper I, as I swear perfect 
 
RIVERS: 
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!

KING EDWARD IV:
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
You have been factious against the other, 
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, I will never remember 
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!

KING IV: 
Dorset, embrace Hastings, lord 
 

This interchange of love, I here protest, 
Upon my part be unviolable. 

HASTINGS: 
And so swear my lord 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou league 
With thy embracements my wife's 
And make me happy in your unity.
 
BUCKINGHAM:
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yours,
but with all duteous 
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me 
With hate in those where I expect most love!
When I have most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend
hollow, and full of guile, 
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
When I am cold in zeal to yours.
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
wanteth our brother Gloucester here, 
To make the perfect period of this peace.
 
BUCKINGHAM:
here comes the noble duke. 
 
GLOUCESTER:
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!

EDWARD IV: 
Happy, indeed, we spent the 
Brother, we deeds of charity; 
Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
 

A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
By false intelligence, or surmise, 
Hold me a foe; 
If unwittingly, or in my 
Have aught committed that hardly borne 
any in this presence, I desire 
To reconcile me to his friendly peace: 
death me be at enmity; 
I desire all good men's 
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
If ever were lodged between us; 
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
That without desert have frown'd on me;
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the infant that is born to-night
thank my God for humility. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
A holy shall this be kept hereafter: 
I would to God were compounded. 
My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
To take our Clarence to 

GLOUCESTER: 
Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
To be so bouted in this royal presence? 
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
do him injury his corse. 
 

Who knows not is dead! who knows he is? 

QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
All seeing heaven, what a world is this! 

BUCKINGHAM:
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?

DORSET: 
Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
But his red hath forsook his 
 
EDWARD IV: 
Is Clarence dead? the order 

GLOUCESTER:
But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
And that a winged Mercury bear: 
tardy cripple bore 
too lag to him buried. 
God grant that some, noble and less loyal, 
Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
And yet go current from suspicion! 
 
DORSET: 
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!

KING EDWARD IV:
pray thee, peace: soul is full of sorrow. 

DORSET:
I not rise, your highness grant. 

KING IV: 
Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.

DORSET: 
forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life; 
Who slew a righteous gentleman 
Lately attendant on Duke of Norfolk. 

KING EDWARD IV:
Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
My brother his was thought, 
And his punishment was cruel death. 
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised 
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
Who me how poor soul did forsake 
The mighty Warwick, and fight for 
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
so grace to put it in my mind. 
But when your carters your waiting-vassals 
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced 
precious of our dear Redeemer, 
You straight are on knees for pardon; 
And I unjustly too, must grant it you 
But for my brother not a man would speak,
Nor ungracious, speak myself 
For him, poor soul. proudest of 
Have been beholding to him in his life;
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
O God, I fear thy justice take hold 
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
Oh, poor Clarence!


This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
How that guilty kindred of queen 
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the king!
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
To comfort Edward with our company. 

BUCKINGHAM: 
We wait upon your grace.
 
Boy: 
Tell me, grandam, is our father dead? 

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, boy.
 
Boy: 
Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'
 
Girl: 
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
If that our noble father be alive?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
pretty cousins, you mistake me 
I lament the sickness of the king. 
As loath to lose him, not your father's death; 
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost. 

Boy:
Then, grandam, conclude that he is 
The king my uncle is to blame for this:
God will revenge it; will importune 
With daily prayers all to that effect.
 
Girl: 
And so will I.
 
DUCHESS 
peace! the king doth love you well: 
Incapable and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess who caused your father's death. 

Boy: 
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
Told me, king, provoked by the queen, 
Devised impeachments to imprison him :
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
Bade him as on father, 
And he would love as his child. 

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Oh, that deceit such gentle shapes, 
And a virtuous vizard hide foul 
He son; yea, and my shame; 
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

Boy:
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam? 
 
DUCHESS YORK: 
Ay, boy. 

Boy:
I cannot Hark! what is this? 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
shall hinder me to wail weep, 
To chide my fortune, and torment myself? 
I'll join black despair soul, 
And to myself become enemy. 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK: 
What means this scene of rude impatience? 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To make an act of tragic violence:
Edward, your son, king, is dead. 
grow the branches now the root is wither'd? 
Why wither not the the sap being 
If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
Or, like obedient subjects, follow 
To his new kingdom of rest. 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow 
As I had title in thy noble husband!
I have bewept worthy death, 
And lived by looking on his images: 
But now two mirrors of his princely 
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
And I for comfort have but one false glass,
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him. 
Thou a widow; yet thou art mother, 
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee: 
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
And pluck'd crutches from my limbs, 
Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
thy and drown thy cries! 
 
Boy:
aunt, you for our father's death; 
How aid you with our kindred tears? 
 
Girl: 
Our distress was unmoan'd; 
Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Give me no help in lamentation;
I am not barren to bring forth complaints 
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
 
Children:
Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!

DUCHESS YORK: 
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!

QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
What stay I but Edward? and he's gone. 
 

What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.

OF YORK: 
What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
Was never widow had so a loss! 


Were never orphans had so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Was never mother had so dear a loss! 
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
Their woes parcell'd, mine are general. 
for an weeps, and so do I; 
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
I for weep, so do not they: 
you me, threefold distress'd, 
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
I will it with lamentations. 
 
DORSET: 
Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
That with unthankfulness, his doing: 
common things, call'd 
With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
Which bounteous hand was kindly lent; 
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
For it the royal you. 

RIVERS:
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
Of young prince son: send straight for 
Let him crown'd; him your comfort lives: 
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave, 
your in living Edward's throne. 

GLOUCESTER: 
Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shining star;
But none can cure their by wailing them. 
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
I did your grace: humbly on my 
I crave your blessing. 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK: 
bless thee; and put in thy mind, 
Love, and duty! 



BUCKINGHAM: 
cloudy heart-sorrowing peers, 
That bear this mutual heavy load of 
Now cheer each other in each other's love 
we spent harvest of this king, 
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
Me seemeth that, with some little train, 
Forthwith from Ludlow the prince be fetch'd 
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.

RIVERS:
Why some train, my Lord Buckingham? 


Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out, 
Which would be so much the more dangerous
how the estate is green yet ungovern'd: 
Where horse bears his commanding 
And may direct his course as please himself,
As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.

GLOUCESTER: 
I the king peace with all of us 
the compact is firm and in 

RIVERS:
And so in me; and I all: 
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
Which haply by much company might be urged:
Therefore I say noble Buckingham, 
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.

HASTINGS: 
And so say I. 

GLOUCESTER: 
Then be so; go we to determine 
Who they shall that straight shall post to Ludlow. 
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
To give your censures in this weighty business?
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
With all our 

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
As index to story we late talk'd of, 
To part the queen's from the king. 

GLOUCESTER: 
My other self, my counsel's consistory,
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.

First 
Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
 
Second Citizen:
I promise you, I scarcely know myself: 
Hear you the news abroad?

First 
Ay, that the king is dead. 
 
Second Citizen:
Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.

Third Citizen:
Neighbours, God speed!
 
First 
Give you good sir. 

Third Citizen: 
Doth this hold of good King Edward's death? 

Second Citizen:
Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
 
Third Citizen:
Then, look a troublous world. 

First Citizen:
No, no; God's good grace his shall reign. 

Third Citizen:
Woe land govern'd by a 

Second Citizen:
In him there is a hope of government, 
That in his nonage council under him,
And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
shall and till then govern well. 
 
First Citizen: 
So stood state when Henry the Sixth 
Was crown'd in Paris but at months old. 
 
Third Citizen:
Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot; 
this land famously 
With politic grave counsel; then king 
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace. 

First Citizen: 
Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
 
Third Citizen:
Better it they all came the father, 
Or by the father there were none at all;
For emulation now, who be nearest, 
Will touch us all too if God prevent not. 
O, full of is the Duke of 
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
And were they to ruled, and not to rule, 
This sickly land might solace as before.

First Citizen: 
Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well. 

Third Citizen: 
When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.

Second Citizen: 
Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
Ye cannot almost with a man 
That looks not heavily and full of fear.
 
Third Citizen: 
Before the times of change, still is it so:
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see 
The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
But leave it all to God. whither away?
 
Second Citizen:
Marry, we were sent for the justices. 

Citizen: 
And so was I: I'll bear you company.
 
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: 
night, I hear, they at Northampton; 
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I long with all my heart to see the prince:
I much since last I saw him. 
 
ELIZABETH: 
But I hear, no; they say my son of York
Hath almost overta'en in his growth. 

YORK: 
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so. 

DUCHESS OF 
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.

YORK: 
Grandam, one night, as we did sit 
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle 
Gloucester,
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Good faith, faith, the saying did hold 
In him that did object the same to thee;
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young, 
So long a-growing and leisurely, 
That, if this rule were true, should be 

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: 
Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is. 

DUCHESS OF YORK: 
I hope he is; but yet let mothers 
 
YORK: 
by my if I been remember'd, 
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.

YORK:
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
full two ere I could get a tooth. 
Grandam, would been a biting jest. 

DUCHESS OF YORK: 
I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?

YORK:
Grandam, his nurse. 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born. 
 
YORK:
If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
 
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: 
Good madam, be not angry with the child.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
Pitchers 

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Here comes a messenger. What news?

Messenger: 
Such news, my lord, as grieves to unfold. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
How fares the prince? 
 
Messenger: 
Well, madam, and in health.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is thy news then? 
 

Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
With them Sir Thomas prisoners. 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who hath committed them?
 
Messenger:
The mighty dukes 
Gloucester and Buckingham. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
For what offence?


sum of all I can, I have 
Why or for what these were committed 
all to my gracious lady. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
I see, as in a map, the end of all.
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Accursed and wrangling days, 
How many of have mine eyes 
My husband lost his life to get the crown;
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
And being seated, and 
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
against self: preposterous 
And frantic outrage, end damned spleen; 
Or let me to look on death more! 
 
QUEEN 
Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
Madam, farewell.
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'll go along with you.
 
QUEEN 
You have no cause.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: 
My gracious lady, go;
And thither bear your and your goods. 
my part, I'll unto your grace 
and so betide 
As well I tender you and all of yours!
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.
 

Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
The way made you melancholy. 

EDWARD: 
uncle; but our crosses on the way 
Have it wearisome, and heavy 
I want uncles here 

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet the of your years 
Hath not yet dived the deceit 
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
Seldom never the heart. 
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
grace attended to their sugar'd words, 
look'd not on poison of their hearts : 
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
 
PRINCE EDWARD:
keep me false friends! they none. 
 
GLOUCESTER:
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet 

Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace with health and happy days!

PRINCE EDWARD:
I thank you, good my lord; thank you all. 
I thought my mother, and my brother York,
Would long ere this have met us the way 
what a slug is that comes not 
To tell us whether will or 
 
BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Welcome, my lord: what, our mother 
 
HASTINGS: 
On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
The queen your mother, and your brother York, 
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince 
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
by was perforce withheld. 

BUCKINGHAM:
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace 
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently?
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
from jealous arms him perforce. 

CARDINAL: 
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak 
Can his mother the Duke of York, 
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
To entreaties, God in heaven 
the holy privilege 
Of blessed not all this land 
I be guilty of so deep 
 
BUCKINGHAM:
You are too senseless--obstinate, lord, 
Too ceremonious and traditional
Weigh it with the grossness of this age, 
You break not sanctuary in seizing 
The benefit thereof always granted 
To those whose have deserved the place, 
And those have the wit to claim place: 
This prince neither claim'd it nor deserved it; 
And therefore, in mine cannot have it: 
Then, him from thence that is not there, 
You no privilege nor charter 
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
 
CARDINAL: 
you shall o'er-rule my mind once. 
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me? 
 
HASTINGS:
I go, my lord.

EDWARD: 
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
Where we sojourn 

GLOUCESTER:
Where it seems best unto your royal self. 
If I may counsel you, some day or 
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
For your best health and 
 
PRINCE EDWARD:
I do not like the Tower, of any place.
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
He did, my gracious lord, that place; 
Which, since, succeeding have re-edified. 
 
PRINCE 
Is it upon record, or else reported
Successively from age, he built it? 

BUCKINGHAM: 
Upon record, my gracious lord.
 
PRINCE EDWARD:
But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
Even to the day. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 

PRINCE EDWARD: 
What say you, uncle? 
 
GLOUCESTER:
I say, without characters, fame lives long. 
Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two meanings in one word.
 
EDWARD: 
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
With what his valour did enrich his wit,
His wit set to make his valour live 
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,-- 

BUCKINGHAM:
What, my gracious lord? 

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if I live I be a 
I'll win our ancient right in France again,
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM: 
Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
 
PRINCE EDWARD:
Richard of York! how our brother? 

YORK:
Well, dread so must I you now. 
 
PRINCE EDWARD:
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours: 
Too late he died that might have kept that title,
Which by his death hath lost much majesty. 

GLOUCESTER:
How fares our cousin, noble Lord 
 
YORK:
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
You said that weeds are fast in growth 
The prince my brother hath far. 

GLOUCESTER: 
He hath, 

YORK:
And therefore is he idle?

GLOUCESTER:
O, my cousin, I must not say so. 


Then is he more beholding to you than I.
 
GLOUCESTER:
He may command me as sovereign; 
But power in me as in a 

YORK:
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.

GLOUCESTER: 
My cousin? with all my heart. 

PRINCE EDWARD: 
A beggar, brother? 
 
YORK: 
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
And being but toy, which is no grief give. 
 

A gift than that I'll give my cousin. 

YORK:
A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.

GLOUCESTER:
A gentle cousin, were it light enough.

YORK: 
O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
In weightier things you'll say beggar nay. 

GLOUCESTER: 
is heavy grace to wear. 

YORK:
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

GLOUCESTER:
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?

YORK: 
I would, that I thank you as you call 

GLOUCESTER:
How?

YORK:
Little.

PRINCE EDWARD: 
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.

YORK:
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
my brother both and me; 
that I am like an 
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.

BUCKINGHAM:
With sharp-provided wit he reasons! 
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
He and aptly taunts himself: 
So cunning and so young wonderful. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
My lord, will't you pass along? 
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother, to entreat of her
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
 
YORK:
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord? 

PRINCE EDWARD: 
My lord protector needs will have it so.

YORK:
I shall not in quiet at the 
 
GLOUCESTER:
Why, what should you fear? 

YORK: 
Marry, uncle Clarence' angry ghost: 
My grandam told me he was murdered there.

PRINCE EDWARD: 
I no uncles dead. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Nor none that live, I hope.

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if I I not fear. 
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart, 
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.

BUCKINGHAM:
Think you, my lord, this little prating York
Was not incensed his subtle mother 
To and scorn you thus opprobriously? 
 
GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy; 
Bold, ingenious, forward, capable 
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.


Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
sworn deeply to what we intend 
As closely to conceal what we impart:
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon way; 
What thou? it not an easy matter 
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
For the instalment of this noble duke 
In the seat royal of this famous isle?

CATESBY:
He sake so loves the 
That he will not be won to aught against him.

BUCKINGHAM:
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?

CATESBY: 
will all in all as Hastings doth. 
 
BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby, 
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
How stand to our purpose; 
And him to-morrow to the 
To sit about the coronation.
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
him, show him all our reasons: 
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
And give us notice of his inclination:
For we to-morrow hold divided councils, 
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd. 
 

Commend me to Lord William: tell him, 
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
To-morrow let blood Pomfret-castle; 
And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.

BUCKINGHAM: 
Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.


My good lords with all the heed 
 
GLOUCESTER:
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

CATESBY: 
You shall, my lord. 

GLOUCESTER:
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.

BUCKINGHAM: 
Now, my lord, we if we perceive 
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?

GLOUCESTER: 
Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
The of and the moveables 
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.

GLOUCESTER: 
And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
We may digest our complots form. 
 
Messenger: 
What, ho! my lord!

HASTINGS:
 
Messenger:
A messenger from the Lord Stanley.

HASTINGS:
What is't o'clock?


Upon the stroke of four. 
 
HASTINGS: 
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?

Messenger:
So it should seem by that I to say. 
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
 
HASTINGS:
And then? 
 
Messenger:
And then he sends you word
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm: 
Besides, he says are two councils held; 
And that may be determined at the one 
which may make you and him to rue at the other.
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
presently you will take horse with him, 
And with all speed post with him toward the north,
To the danger that his soul divines. 
 
HASTINGS:
Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
Bid him not fear the separated councils
His honour and myself are at the one,
And at the other is my servant Catesby
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
And for his dreams, I he fond 
the mockery unquiet slumbers 
fly the boar before the boar pursues, 
Were the boar to us 
And make pursuit he did mean no chase. 
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
And we will both together to the Tower,
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.

Messenger:
lord, I'll tell him say. 

CATESBY:
Many good morrows my 

HASTINGS: 
Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring 
What news, what news, in this our tottering state? 

CATESBY: 
It is world, lord; 
And I believe twill never stand upright
Tim Richard the the realm. 
 
HASTINGS: 
How! wear garland! dost thou crown? 
 
CATESBY: 
Ay, my lord. 

HASTINGS:
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
I will see the crown so foul misplaced. 
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
 
CATESBY: 
Ay, on my and hopes to find 
party for the gain thereof: 
And thereupon he sends you this good news, 
That this same very day your enemies,
kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret. 

HASTINGS:
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, 
Because they have been still mine enemies:
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
God knows I will not do it, to the death.


God keep your lordship that mind! 

HASTINGS:
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence, 
That they who brought me in my master's hate
I live to look their tragedy. 
I tell thee, Catesby--

CATESBY: 
What, my lord? 

HASTINGS:
Ere a fortnight make me elder,
send some packing that yet think it. 
 
CATESBY:
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
When men are unprepared and look not for it. 

HASTINGS: 
O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill 
With some men else, think themselves as safe 
and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear 
princely Richard and to Buckingham. 

CATESBY:
The princes both high account of you; 
For they account his head upon the bridge. 
 
HASTINGS: 
I know they do; and I have well it. 
on, come where is your boar-spear, man? 
Fear you the boar, and go 

STANLEY: 
lord, morrow; good morrow, Catesby: 
You jest on, but, the holy 
do not these several I. 
 
HASTINGS: 
My 
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
never in my life, I do protest, 
Was it precious to me than 'tis now: 
you, but that I know our state secure, 
I would be so triumphant as I am?

STANLEY: 
The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.

HASTINGS:
Come, have with you. Wot you 
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
 
LORD STANLEY:
They, for truth, might better their heads 
Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
But come, my lord, away. 

HASTINGS:
Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee? 

Pursuivant:
The better that your lordship please to ask.

HASTINGS:
I thee, man, 'tis with now 
Than when I thee last where now we meet: 
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
This day those enemies are put to death,
And I in better state than e'er I was.
 
Pursuivant:
God it, to your honour's good 

HASTINGS:
Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.

Pursuivant:
God your 


Well met, my am glad to your honour. 

HASTINGS:
I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
I am your debt for your last exercise; 
Come the next Sabbath, and will content 
 
BUCKINGHAM:
What, talking priest, chamberlain? 
Your Pomfret, they do need the priest; 
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.


Good faith, and when met holy 
Those you came into my mind. 
What, go you toward the Tower? 

BUCKINGHAM:
I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
I shall return before your lordship thence.

HASTINGS: 
enough, for I stay dinner there. 



HASTINGS: 
I'll wait upon your lordship.
 
RATCLIFF: 
Come, bring forth the prisoners.
 
RIVERS: 
Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty. 
 
GREY:
keep the prince from all the pack of you! 
A knot you are of blood-suckers! 
 
VAUGHAN: 
You live that shall cry for this after. 
 
RATCLIFF: 
Dispatch; the limit your lives is out. 

RIVERS: 
O Pomfret, O thou bloody prison, 
Fatal and ominous peers! 
Within the guilty of thy walls 
Richard the here to death; 
And, for more to thy dismal 
thee up our to drink. 

GREY:
Now curse fall'n our heads, 
For standing by Richard stabb'd her son. 

RIVERS:
Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham, 
cursed O, remember, God 
To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
for my sister and princely sons, 
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
 
RATCLIFF: 
Make haste; the hour of expiate. 

RIVERS:
Come, Grey, Vaughan, let all embrace: 
And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.
 
HASTINGS: 
My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
Is, determine of the coronation. 
In God's name, speak: when is day? 
 

Are all things fitting for royal 

DERBY:
is, and wants but nomination. 

BISHOP OF ELY: 
To-morrow, then, I judge happy 
 
BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows protector's mind herein? 
Who is most inward royal duke? 

OF ELY: 
Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
our he knows no of 
Than of yours; 
Nor I no of his, than you of mine. 
Lord you and are near love. 

HASTINGS: 
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well; 
his purpose the 
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd 
His gracious pleasure any therein: 
you, noble may name the time; 
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
 
BISHOP OF ELY:
Now in good time, here comes the himself. 

GLOUCESTER: 
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow. 
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence neglect no great designs, 
Which by my presence might have been concluded.

BUCKINGHAM: 
Had not you come your cue, my lord 
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,-- 
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.

GLOUCESTER: 
my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder; 
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well. 

HASTINGS: 
I thank your grace.
 
GLOUCESTER: 
My lord of Ely! 

BISHOP OF ELY:
My lord?
 
GLOUCESTER:
When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I do beseech you send for some of them.

BISHOP OF ELY: 
lord, with all my heart. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Cousin word with you. 
Catesby hath Hastings in business, 
finds the testy so hot, 
As he will lose his head ere give consent
His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
the royalty of England's throne. 

BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.

DERBY: 
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
For I myself not so well provided 
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my protector? I have sent these 

 
HASTINGS:
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
There's some conceit other likes him well, 
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
I think there's never a man in Christendom
can less hide love or hate 
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.


What of his heart perceive you in his face
any show'd to-day? 

HASTINGS:
Marry, that no man here he 
For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.

DERBY: 
I pray God he be not, I say.


I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
Upon my body with their hellish charms?
 
HASTINGS:
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
Makes me most forward this noble presence 
To doom offenders, whatsoever they be 
I say, my lord, deserved death. 

GLOUCESTER:
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
See how I bewitch'd; behold mine arm 
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
And this is wife, that witch, 
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

HASTINGS:
they have done this thing, my gracious lord-- 
 
GLOUCESTER:
If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
Tellest thou me of Thou art a traitor: 
with his Now, by Saint Paul I swear, 
I will not dine until I same. 
Lovel Ratcliff, look it be done: 
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.

HASTINGS:
Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
For I, too might prevented 
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
Three my foot-cloth did stumble, 
And startled, when he upon the Tower, 
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
I now repent I told the pursuivant
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
I secure in grace and favour. 
O Margaret, Margaret, thy curse 
lighted on poor Hastings' head! 

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
a short shrift; he longs to see your 


O momentary grace of mortal men,
we more for the of 
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.


Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.

HASTINGS:
O bloody Richard! miserable England!
I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee 
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon. 
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Come, cousin, canst thou quake, change thy colour, 
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
And then begin again, and stop again,
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
Speak and look back, and pry on every side, 
and start a straw, 
Intending deep suspicion: looks 
at my service, like enforced 
And both are ready in their offices,
At any time, to grace my stratagems.
But what, is Catesby gone?
 
GLOUCESTER: 
He is; and, see, he the mayor along. 

BUCKINGHAM: 
Lord mayor,--

GLOUCESTER:
Look to the drawbridge there!
 
BUCKINGHAM:
Hark! a drum. 

GLOUCESTER:
Catesby, o'erlook the walls. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Lord mayor, the reason we have sent-- 

GLOUCESTER: 
Look back, defend thee, here are 

BUCKINGHAM: 
God and our innocency defend and guard 

GLOUCESTER:
Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.

LOVEL:
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

GLOUCESTER: 
So dear loved the man, that I must 
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That upon this a Christian; 
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts:
So smooth he daub'd his with show of virtue, 
That, his apparent guilt omitted, 
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
He lived from all attainder of suspect.
 
BUCKINGHAM:
well, the covert'st shelter'd traitor 
That ever lived.
Would you imagine, almost believe, 
Were't not that, by great preservation, 
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
This day had plotted, in the council-house
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?

Mayor: 
What, had he so?

GLOUCESTER:
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we would, against the form of law,
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
But that the extreme peril of the case,
The peace of England and our persons' safety,
Enforced to this execution? 

Lord Mayor: 
Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death; 
you my good lords, both have well 
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
I never look'd for better at his hands,
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
 
GLOUCESTER:
Yet had not determined he should die, 
Until your lordship came to see death; 
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented: 
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
The traitor speak, and timorously confess 
The manner and the purpose of his treason;
That you might well have signified the same
Unto the citizens, who haply 
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.

Lord Mayor: 
But, good your word serve, 
well as I had seen heard him 
And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
With all your just in this 

GLOUCESTER:
And to end wish'd your lord-ship here, 
To avoid the carping censures the world. 

BUCKINGHAM:
But since you come too late of our intents,
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
so, my lord mayor, we bid farewell. 

GLOUCESTER:
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham. 
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
at your meet'st advantage the time, 
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
Tell them how put to death 
Only for saying he would make his son
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
urge his hateful luxury 
And bestial appetite in change of lust;
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives, 
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
Without control, listed to make his prey.
Nay, for a need, thus near my person: 
Tell when mother went with child 
that York 
My princely father then had in France 
And, by just computation time, 
Found that the was not his 
Which well appeared in his lineaments,
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle; 
Where you shall find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.

BUCKINGHAM: 
I go: and towards three or four o'clock
Look for the news that the Guildhall 
 

Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
Go thou to Friar Penker; them both 
Meet me within this hour Castle. 
Now will I in, to take privy 
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
And to give notice, that no manner of person
At any have recourse unto princes. 
 
Scrivener: 
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
it this day read over in Paul's. 
And mark well the sequel hangs together: 
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
yesternight Catesby was it brought 
The precedent was full as long a-doing:
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
That not this palpable device? 
Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
When such bad dealings must be in 

GLOUCESTER:
How now, my what say the citizens? 

BUCKINGHAM: 
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.

GLOUCESTER: 
Touch'd you bastardy Edward's 
 

I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his contract deputy in France; 
The insatiate greediness of his 
his enforcement city wives; 
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
As being got, father in 
His resemblance, being not like the duke;
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
Being the right idea of your father,
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
open all your in 
Your dicipline in war, in peace, 
Your bounty, humility: 
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
or slightly in discourse 
when mine grew an end 
I that did love their country's good 
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
 
GLOUCESTER:
Ah! and did they so? 

BUCKINGHAM:
No, so help me, they spake not a word; 
But, like statues or stones, 
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale. 
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
And the mayor what meant this wilful silence: 
His answer was, the people were not wont
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
Then he was urged to tell my tale 
the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;' 
nothing spake in warrant himself. 
he had done, some followers of mine own, 
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
And some ten voices cried King Richard!' 
And thus I took the vantage of those few,
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth 
'This general and loving 
your wisdoms and your love to Richard:' 
And even here brake off, and away. 

GLOUCESTER: 
What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
 
BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my troth, my lord.
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come? 

BUCKINGHAM: 
The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
Be not you spoke with, but mighty suit: 
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
And stand betwixt two good my lord; 
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
And be not easily won to our request:
Play the maid's still answer nay, and take it. 

GLOUCESTER: 
I go; and if you plead as well for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself,
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.

BUCKINGHAM:
Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
Welcome my lord; I dance here; 
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
What says he?
 
CATESBY:
My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
To visit him to-morrow or next day: 
He within, with two right reverend fathers, 
Divinely bent to 
And no worldly would he be moved, 
draw him from his holy exercise. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
In matters of great moment, 
No less importing than our general good,
Are come to have some conference with grace. 
 
CATESBY: 
I'll him what you say, my lord. 
 
BUCKINGHAM:
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
But on his knees at 
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
meditating with deep divines; 
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
But praying, to his watchful soul: 
Happy were England, would this prince 
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof: 
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.

Lord Mayor: 
Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!

BUCKINGHAM:
I he will. 
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?
 

My lord, 
He wonders what end you have assembled 
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him. 

BUCKINGHAM: 
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
And so once more and tell his 
When holy and devout religious men
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
sweet is zealous contemplation. 
 
Mayor: 
See, where he stands between two 
 
BUCKINGHAM:
Two props of a Christian prince, 
To stay him from the fall of vanity:
And, a book of prayer in his hand, 
True ornaments to know a man. 
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
Lend favourable ears to our request;
And us the interruption 
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.


My lord, there needs no such apology:
I rather do beseech you pardon me,
Who, earnest in the service of my God,
Neglect the visitation of my friends.
But, leaving this, what is your grace's 

BUCKINGHAM: 
Even which pleaseth God above, 
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.

GLOUCESTER:
I do suspect I have done 
That seems in the city's eyes, 
And that you reprehend my 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!

GLOUCESTER:
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?

BUCKINGHAM:
Then know, it is your fault that you resign
supreme seat, the throne majestical, 
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
Your state of your due birth, 
The lineal glory of your royal house,
To the corruption of a blemished 
Whilst, the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, 
Which here we waken to our country's good, 
This noble doth her limbs; 
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
royal graft with ignoble plants, 
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
Which to heartily solicit 
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
And kingly government of this your land,
Not protector, steward, substitute, 
Or lowly factor for another's gain;
But as successively from blood to blood,
Your right birth, your empery, own. 
For this, consorted with the citizens,
Your very worshipful and loving friends,
And by their vehement instigation,
In this just suit come I to move your grace.


I know not whether to depart in silence,
Or bitterly to speak in reproof. 
fitteth my degree or condition 
If not to answer, you might think 
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
To the golden yoke of sovereignty, 
you would here impose me; 
If reprove for suit of yours, 
So season'd with your faithful love to me.
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
to speak, and to avoid the 
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
Definitively thus I answer you.
Your love my thanks; but my desert 
Unmeritable shuns your request. 
First if all obstacles were cut away,
that my path were to the crown, 
As my ripe and due by birth 
Yet much my poverty of 
mighty and so many my defects, 
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea, 
Than my to hid, 
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd. 
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
Will well become the seat of majesty,
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
On him lay what you would lay on me, 
The right and fortune of his happy stars;
Which God defend that I should wring from him! 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
All 
that Edward your brother's son: 
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
Your mother lives a witness that vow-- 
And by substitute betroth'd 
To Bona, sister King 
These put a poor petitioner, 
A care-crazed mother of many 
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
Even in the afternoon of her best days, 
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
To base declension and loathed bigamy 
By in unlawful bed, got 
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
More bitterly could I expostulate, 
Save that, for reverence to some alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
Then, good my lord, to your royal self 
proffer'd benefit of dignity; 
If non to bless us and the land withal,
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
the corruption 
Unto a lineal true-derived course.

Lord Mayor:
Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.

BUCKINGHAM:
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.

CATESBY: 
O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!

GLOUCESTER: 
Alas, why would you heap these cares on me? 
unfit for state and majesty; 
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
I cannot nor I will yield to you. 
 
BUCKINGHAM:
If you refuse it,--as, in love zeal, 
depose the child, brother's son; 
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
Which we have noted in to 
And egally indeed all estates,-- 
Yet accept our suit or no, 
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
we will plant other the throne, 
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
And in resolution here we 
Come, citizens: 'zounds! entreat no more. 
 

O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
 
CATESBY:
Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my lord, lest all the land rue it. 

GLOUCESTER: 
Would you enforce me to a world of care?
Well, again. I am 
penetrable your. kind entreats, 
Albeit against my and my 
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave 
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no, 
I to the load: 
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
Attend the sequel of your imposition,
Your enforcement shall acquittance me 
From all impure blots and stains thereof; 
For God he knows, and you may partly see, 
How far I am from the desire thereof.
 
Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
 
GLOUCESTER: 
In saying but say the truth. 
 
BUCKINGHAM:
I salute you with kingly title: 
Long live Richard, England's royal king!
 
Lord Mayor: 
Amen. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?

GLOUCESTER: 
Even when you please, since you will have it so.
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
so joyfully take our leave. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Come, let us to our holy task again.
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, friends. 
 
DUCHESS YORK: 
Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet 
Led in the of her kind of Gloucester? 
Now, for my life, she's wandering the Tower, 
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
Daughter, well met.

LADY ANNE: 
God your graces both 
A happy and a joyful time of day!
 
QUEEN 
As much to you, good sister! Whither away?

LADY ANNE: 
No than and, as I guess, 
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
To gratulate the gentle princes there.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?

BRAKENBURY:
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
may not suffer you to visit them; 
The king hath straitly the 
 
QUEEN

BRAKENBURY:

DUCHESS OF YORK:

LADY ANNE:
Their aunt I am law, love their 
Then bring me to their I'll bear thy blame 
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
 
BRAKENBURY:
No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.

LORD STANLEY: 
Let me but you, ladies, one hence, 
And salute your grace mother, 
And reverend looker on, of fair 
madam, must straight to Westminster, 
There be crowned Richard's royal queen. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
May have some scope to beat, or else I 
With this news! 
 
LADY ANNE: 
Despiteful O unpleasing news! 

DORSET:
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
Death and destruction dog thee the heels; 
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
If thou outstrip death, go cross the seas, 
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
Lest thou increase number of the dead; 
And make thrall of Margaret's curse, 
Nor mother, nor England's queen. 
 

of wise is this your counsel, madam. 
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
You shall have letters from me my son 
To on the way, and welcome you. 
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
O accursed womb, the bed of death! 
A cockatrice hast to the world, 
Whose unavoided eye is 

LORD STANLEY: 
Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.

LADY ANNE:
And I unwillingness will go. 
I would God that the inclusive verge 
Of golden that round my brow 
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
Anointed let me be with deadly venom, 
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Go, poor soul, I envy thy glory 
To feed wish no harm. 

ANNE: 
No! why?  he that is my husband now 
Came to me, I follow'd Henry's corse, 
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
Which issued from my other angel husband
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
For me, so young, so old a widow! 
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
And be thy any be so mad-- 
As miserable by the life of thee
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
grew to his honey words 
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
For never yet one hour in his bed
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
Besides, for 
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid me. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
Poor adieu! I pity thy complaining. 
 
LADY ANNE:
No more than from soul I mourn for 


Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory! 

LADY ANNE:
Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Stay, yet look back me unto the Tower.

For tender princes, use my babies well!

KING RICHARD III:
O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
To try if thou be current gold indeed
Young lives: now what I would say. 

BUCKINGHAM:
Say on, my loving lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,
 

Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.

KING RICHARD III: 
Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
True, noble prince. 
 
RICHARD III: 
bitter consequence, 
Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'

His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
 
KING RICHARD III:

To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
Where he abides.

Whom I marry straight to daughter: 
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him. 
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
That Anne my wife sick and to die: 
About it; for it stands me much upon,
To stop hopes whose growth damage me. 
I married to my brother's 
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
Murder her brothers, and marry her! 
Uncertain of But I am in 
So far in blood sin will pluck on sin: 
Tear-falling pity not in this eye. 
Is thy name Tyrrel?
 
TYRREL: 
James and most obedient subject. 

KING RICHARD III:
Art thou, 
 
TYRREL: 
Prove me, my gracious sovereign.
 
KING III: 
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?

TYRREL:
Ay, my lord;
But I had rather two 
 
RICHARD III: 
Why, there thou two enemies, 
to my rest and sweet sleep's disturbers 
Are they that would have thee deal upon: 
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower. 

TYRREL: 
Let me means to come to them, 
And soon I'll rid from fear of them. 

KING RICHARD III:
Thou sing'st Hark, come hither, Tyrrel 
Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
There is no more but so: say it is done,
And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.

TYRREL:
'Tis done, my lord. 
 
KING RICHARD III:
Shall we hear from Tyrrel, ere we sleep? 

TYRREL:
Ye shall, my Lord.
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
My Lord, I have consider'd in mind 
The late demand that you did sound me in.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
 
BUCKINGHAM:
I hear news, my lord. 

KING III: 
Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
For which honour and faith 
The earldom Hereford and the 
The which you promised I should possess.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, look to your wife; if she 
Letters to Richmond, you answer it. 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
What says your highness to my just demand?

KING RICHARD III: 
As I remember, Henry the Sixth
Did that Richmond should be king, 
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--
 

My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
How chance the not at time 
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him? 

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, promise for the earldom,-- 
 
KING RICHARD III:
Richmond! When last I was 
The mayor in courtesy me the castle, 
And call'd Rougemont: which name started, 
a bard of me once 
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
 

My 

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, what's o'clock?
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
what promised me. 
 
KING RICHARD III:
Well, but what's o'clock? 
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Upon the stroke of ten.

KING RICHARD 
Well, let it strike. 

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike?
 
KING RICHARD III:
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke 
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
I am not in giving to-day. 

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.
 
KING RICHARD III: 
tut, 
Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.
 
BUCKINGHAM: 
Is it even so? rewards he my true service 
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
O, think on Hastings, and be gone 
To Brecknock, while fearful head is on! 

TYRREL:
tyrannous and bloody deed is 
The most arch of piteous massacre
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I suborn 
To do this ruthless piece butchery, 
Although they were villains, dogs, 
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion 
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories. 
'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
'Thus, quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another 
Within their innocent alabaster arms: 
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, 
Which in their summer beauty each other. 
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
O! the devil'--there the villain 
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
The most replenished sweet work of nature, 
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
Thus both are gone with conscience remorse; 
They could not speak; and so I left them both, 
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
And comes. 
All hail, sovereign liege! 

KING RICHARD III:
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?

TYRREL:
If to have done the thing you gave in charge
Beget your happiness, be happy then,
For it is done, lord. 

KING RICHARD III:
But didst thou see them dead?
 
TYRREL: 
I did, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
And gentle Tyrrel? 
 

The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
how or what place I do not know. 
 
KING RICHARD III:
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
And thou shalt the process of their death. 
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
And be inheritor of thy desire. 
Farewell till soon. 
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
And wife hath bid the night. 
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.

CATESBY:
My lord! 
 
KING RICHARD III: 
Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?

CATESBY: 
Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
Is in the field, and his power increaseth. 
 
KING RICHARD III: 
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
Delay leads impotent and 
Then fiery expedition be my wing,
Jove's and herald a king! 
Come, men: my counsel is my shield; 
We must be brief when traitors brave the field. 

QUEEN MARGARET:
So, now prosperity begins to mellow
And into rotten 
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
A dire induction am I witness to,
And will to France, hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
yet your gentle souls fly in air 
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
Hover about me with your airy wings
And hear your mother's lamentation!
 
MARGARET: 
Hover about her; say, that right for right
Hath dimm'd your infant to aged night. 

DUCHESS OF YORK: 
So many miseries have crazed my voice,
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet. 
Edward Edward pays a dying debt. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
them in the entrails of the wolf? 
When thou when a was done? 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
sight, dead poor mortal living ghost, 
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth, 
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
that thou wouldst as well afford a grave 
thou yield seat! 
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
O, who any cause to mourn but 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
Give mine the benefit of seniory,
And let my woes frown on upper 
If sorrow admit society, 
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
I an Edward, a Richard kill'd 
I had a Harry, till a kill'd him: 
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst Richard, till a him; 

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him. 

QUEEN MARGARET: 
Thou hadst a Clarence Richard kill'd him. 
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their blood, 
foul defacer of God's handiwork, 
That excellent grand tyrant earth, 
That reigns galled eyes weeping 
Thy womb let loose, to us to graves. 
O upright, just, and true-disposing God, 
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan! 

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

MARGARET: 
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward: 
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
Young York he is but boot, because both they
Match the high perfection of my loss: 
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
And of this 
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
factor, to buy souls 
And send them thither: but at hand, 
his piteous and end: 
Earth gapes, burns, fiends roar, pray. 
To have him suddenly convey'd away. 
his bond life, dear prey, 
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!

ELIZABETH: 
O, thou didst prophesy the time would 
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad! 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen; 
The presentation of but what I was;
The flattering index of a direful pageant; 
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
A mother only mock'd with two babes; 
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
A queen in jest, to fill the scene. 
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
Where thy children? wherein dost thou, 
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
be peers that flatter'd thee? 
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
Decline all this, and see thou art: 
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
For joyful mother, one that the name; 
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
And left thee but a very prey to time;
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not 
the just proportion of sorrow? 
Now thy neck bears half my burthen'd 
From which even here I slip my weary neck,
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
These English woes will me smile in France. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile, 
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!

MARGARET: 
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the 
Compare dead happiness with woe; 
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
And he that slew them fouler than he is:
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are dull; O, quicken them thine! 
 
QUEEN 
Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why should calamity be full of words?
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Windy attorneys to their client woes, 
Airy succeeders of intestate joys, 
Poor breathing orators of miseries!
Let them have scope: though what they do impart
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart. 

DUCHESS OF YORK: 
If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
 
KING RICHARD III:
intercepts my expedition? 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, she that might have intercepted thee,
By strangling thee in her accursed 
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hidest thou that forehead with golden crown, 
Where should be graven, if that right were right,
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
Tell me, villain slave, where are my children? 
 
DUCHESS YORK: 
Thou toad, thou where is Clarence? 
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, 
 
KING RICHARD III:
A flourish, strike alarum, drums! 
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
Rail on the Lord's strike, I say! 
Either patient, and entreat me fair, 
Or with the clamorous report of war
Thus will I drown your exclamations. 

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou my son? 

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.

DUCHESS OF YORK: 
patiently my impatience. 
 
KING RICHARD III:
Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
Which cannot the accent of reproof. 

DUCHESS OF YORK: 
O, let me speak! 

KING RICHARD III: 
Do then: but I'll not hear. 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK: 
I will be gentle in my speech. 

RICHARD 
And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK: 
Art thou I have stay'd for thee, 
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

KING RICHARD 
And came not at last comfort you? 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
Thou camest earth to make my hell. 
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me; 
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days desperate, wild, and 
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
Thy age bloody, 
treacherous,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
What comfortable hour thou name, 
That ever graced me in thy company?
 
KING RICHARD III:
Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd 
your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious in your sight,
Let me march on, and not offend your 
Strike the drum.
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I prithee, hear me 

KING RICHARD III:
You speak too bitterly.
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
me a word; 
I shall never speak to thee again. 

KING RICHARD III: 
So.
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror, 
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never look upon thy face again.
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
My prayers on the adverse fight; 
And there the souls Edward's children 
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies 
And promise them success and victory.
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

QUEEN 
Though far more cause, yet less spirit to 
Abides in me; I say amen to all.

KING RICHARD III:
Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.

ELIZABETH: 
I no more sons of the royal blood 
For thee my daughters, Richard, 
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
And therefore level not to hit their lives. 

KING RICHARD III:
have a daughter Elizabeth, 
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And must she die for this? O, let her live,
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
Slander as false to Edward's bed; 
Throw over her the veil of infamy:
So live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter, 
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.

KING RICHARD III: 
Wrong not her she of blood. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
 
KING RICHARD 
Her life is only safest in her birth.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And only in that safety died her brothers. 

KING RICHARD III:
Lo, at their births good stars were opposite. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, to their lives bad friends contrary. 

RICHARD III: 
All is the doom destiny. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
If grace had bless'd a fairer life. 

KING RICHARD III:
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle 
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction: 
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
Till it whetted on thy stone-hard 
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
And in such a desperate bay of death, 
Like a poor bark, of and tackling 
Rush all to pieces thy rocky bosom. 

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars,
As I intend good to you and 
you or yours were by me wrong'd! 

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
To be that can do me good? 
 
KING RICHARD III:
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
some scaffold, there their 

KING RICHARD III:
No, the dignity and height of honour 
high imperial type of earth's glory. 
 
QUEEN 
Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
what state, what honour, 
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?

KING RICHARD III:
Even all have; yea, and myself all, 
Will I withal child of 
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown remembrance of those wrongs 
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.

KING RICHARD III: 
Then my soul I love daughter. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My mother thinks it with her soul. 

KING RICHARD 
What do you think? 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
That thou dost love my daughter from thy 
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.

KING RICHARD III:
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
mean, that with my soul I daughter, 
And mean make her queen of England. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Say then, who thou shall be her king? 

KING RICHARD III: 
he that her queen who should be else? 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What, thou? 
 
KING III: 
I, even I: what think you of it, madam?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How woo her? 
 
KING RICHARD 
would I learn of you, 
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
And wilt thou learn of me? 

KING RICHARD III: 
with all my 

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave 
Edward York; then haply she weep: 
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did 
The sap from her sweet body 
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
this force her to love, 
Send her story of noble acts; 
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

KING RICHARD III: 
Come, come, mock me; this is not the way 
To win our daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There is no other way
Unless couldst on some other shape, 
And not be Richard that hath done all 

KING RICHARD III:
Say that did all for love of her. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
 
KING RICHARD III:
Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
Men shall deal sometimes, 
Which after hours give leisure to repent.
If I take the kingdom from 
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter. 
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your blood daughter 
A grandam's name is little less in love
Than is the doting title of a mother;
They are as children but one step below,
of mettle, of your blood; 
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
Endured her, whom you bid like sorrow. 
Your children were vexation to your 
But shall be a comfort to your age. 
The loss you have is but a son being king,
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
I make you what amends I would, 
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps foreign soil, 
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
To high promotions and great dignity:
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
shall call thy Dorset brother; 
Again shall you be mother to a king,
And all the ruins of distressful 
Repair'd with double riches of content.
What! we have many goodly days to 
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
their loan with interest 
Of ten times double gain of happiness.
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go 
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
Of golden acquaint the princess 
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The dull-brain'd 
Bound triumphant will I come 
And daughter conqueror's bed; 
To whom I will retail my conquest won,
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
What were I best to say? her father's brother
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
Under shall I woo for thee, 
That God, the honour her love, 
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
 
KING RICHARD III: 
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Which she shall with still lasting 
 
KING RICHARD 
Say that the king, which may command, 

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands the king's King forbids. 

KING RICHARD 
Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
To wail the tide, as her mother doth.

RICHARD III: 
Say, I will love her everlastingly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
 
RICHARD 
Sweetly in force unto fair life's end. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
 
KING RICHARD III:
So long as heaven and lengthens it. 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So long Richard likes of it. 

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I, am her subject love. 

ELIZABETH: 
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.

KING RICHARD III:
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.

RICHARD III: 
Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style. 
 
KING RICHARD III: 
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.

KING RICHARD III:
not on that madam; that is past. 


Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
 

Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd. 

KING RICHARD III:
I swear--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By nothing; for this is no oath:
George, profaned, hath lost holy honour; 
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
if something thou swear be believed, 
Swear then by something that thou hast wrong'd. 
 
KING RICHARD III:
Now, by the world-- 

QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.

KING RICHARD III:

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
 
KING RICHARD III:
Then, by myself--
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
Thyself thyself misusest.
 
KING RICHARD III:
Why then, by God--
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
wrong is of all. 
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by 
The the king thy brother made 
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
If hadst fear'd to oath by Him, 
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow, 
Had graced the tender temples of my child,
And princes had been breathing here, 
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.

KING RICHARD III: 
The time to come. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
That hast wronged in the 
For I myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
The children whose parents thou hast 
slaughter'd,
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age; 
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd, 
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
Swear not by time to come; thou hast 
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.

KING RICHARD III:
As I intend and repent, 
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
fortune me happy hours! 
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy 
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
I tender not thy princely daughter! 
In her consists my happiness and thine;
Without her, follows to this land and me,
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
desolation, and 
It cannot be avoided but by this;
It not be avoided but by this. 
Therefore, mother,--I must can you so-- 
Be the attorney of my love to her:
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
the necessity of times, 
not peevish-fond in great

Shall I be of the thus? 

KING RICHARD III: 
Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.

Shall I forget myself to be myself?
 
KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if yourself's remembrance yourself.

But in your daughter's womb I bury them:

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

KING RICHARD III: 
And be a happy mother by the deed.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
I go. to me very

Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!

RATCLIFF:
My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
there expecting but the aid 
Of to welcome them ashore. 

KING RICHARD III: 
light-foot friend post to the of Norfolk: 
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?
 

Here, my lord. 
 
KING RICHARD III:
Fly to the 
Post to Salisbury 
When thou comest thither-- 
Dull, unmindful villain,
Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?

CATESBY: 
First, mighty sovereign, let me your mind, 
What from your shall to him. 

KING RICHARD III: 
O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
greatest strength and power he can make, 
meet me presently Salisbury. 

CATESBY: 
I 

RATCLIFF:
What is't your highness' pleasure I shall at 

 
KING RICHARD III: 
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?

RATCLIFF: 
Your me I should post before. 
 
KING RICHARD III:
My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed. 
How now, what news with you?
 
STANLEY:
None good, my lord, to please you the hearing; 
Nor none so but it may well be told. 

KING RICHARD III:
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou run so many mile about,
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
Once more, what news?
 
STANLEY:
Richmond is on the seas.
 
RICHARD III: 
There him sink, and be the seas on him! 
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
 
STANLEY: 
know not, mighty sovereign, by 
 
KING RICHARD III: 
Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?


Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely, 
He makes for England, to claim the crown. 
 
KING RICHARD III:
Is the chair is the sword unsway'd? 
Is king dead? the empire 
What heir of York is there alive but we?
And who is England's king but great York's heir?
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?
 
STANLEY: 
Unless that, my liege, I cannot guess. 

III: 
Unless for that he be your liege, 
You cannot guess comes. 
Thou wilt revolt, fly to him, fear. 

STANLEY: 
No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.

KING RICHARD III: 
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not upon western shore. 
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!

STANLEY:
No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
 
KING RICHARD III:
Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
 
STANLEY: 
They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
Please it your majesty to give me leave,
I'll muster up my friends, and meet grace 
Where and what time your majesty shall please. 
 
KING RICHARD III: 
Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond: 
trust you, sir. 
 

Most mighty sovereign,
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful: 
I never was nor never be false. 

KING RICHARD III:
Well, 
Go muster hear you, leave 
Your son, look your be 
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
 
STANLEY: 
So deal with him as prove true to you. 

Messenger: 
My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire, 
As I by friends am well advertised,
and the haughty prelate 
of Exeter, his brother there, 
With many more confederates, are in arms.


My liege, in Kent the Guildfords in 
And every more 
Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.
 
Third Messenger: 
My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--

KING RICHARD III: 
Out on you, nothing but songs of death? 
Take that, until thou bring me better news.

Third Messenger: 
The I have to tell your 
Is, that by sudden floods of waters, 
army is dispersed and scatter'd; 
he wander'd away alone, 
No man knows whither.
 
KING RICHARD III:
I cry thee mercy:
There is my purse to cure that blow of 
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
Reward to him that brings the traitor in? 

Third 
Such proclamation hath been made, my liege. 

Fourth Messenger: 
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
'Tis said, my liege, in are in arms. 
Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat 
Unto the to ask those on the 
If they were his assistants, or no; 
Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.
party: he, 
Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.

KING RICHARD III: 
March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
If not to fight with foreign enemies,
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

CATESBY:
My liege, Duke of is 
That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
colder tidings, they must be told. 

KING III: 
Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here, 
A royal battle and lost 
Some one Buckingham brought 
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
 

Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
That in the sty of this most bloody boar
My son George Stanley frank'd in hold: 
If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
of that withholds my present aid. 
tell me, where princely Richmond now? 

CHRISTOPHER:
At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.
 
DERBY:
What men of name resort to him?

CHRISTOPHER:
Sir Herbert, a renowned soldier; 
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Stanley; 
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
And many more of noble fame and worth: 
And towards London they do bend their course,
If by the way they be not fought withal.

DERBY:
Return unto thy lord; commend to 
Tell him the queen hath heartily consented 
He shall espouse Elizabeth her 
These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.

BUCKINGHAM:
Will not Richard me speak with 

Sheriff:
No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
 
BUCKINGHAM:
Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
Vaughan, and that have 
By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
If that your moody discontented souls 
Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
for revenge mock my 
This is All-Souls' day, fellows, it not? 
 
Sheriff:
It is, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM: 
Why, All-Souls' day my body's 
This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
I wish't might fall on I was found 
False to his children or his wife's allies
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
By false him I trusted 
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
That high All-Seer that I dallied with
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head 
given in earnest what begg'd jest. 
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men 
To turn their own points on masters' bosoms: 
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
he,' quoth she, split thy heart with sorrow, 
Remember Margaret was 
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
 
RICHMOND:
Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
underneath the yoke of tyranny, 
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Have we march'd on impediment; 
And receive from our father Stanley 
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
Near to the town of Leicester, learn 
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
By this one bloody of sharp war. 

OXFORD: 
Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
To fight against that homicide. 
 
HERBERT: 
I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.

BLUNT:
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear. 
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.
 
RICHMOND: 
All for our Then, in name, march: 
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings. 

KING RICHARD III: 
Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
 
SURREY:
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
 
KING RICHARD III: 
My Lord of Norfolk,-- 
 
NORFOLK:

KING RICHARD 
Norfolk, we must have knocks; we 

NORFOLK: 
We both and take, my gracious lord. 
 
KING III: 
Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
But where to-morrow?  Well, all's for that. 
Who hath descried of the foe? 
 
NORFOLK:
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, our battalion trebles that account: 
Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
Which they upon the adverse

And by the bright track of his fiery 
Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
Sir William you shall bear my standard. 
Give me some ink and paper in my tent
I'll draw the form and model our battle, 
Limit each leader to his several charge,
And part our strength. 
My of you, Sir William Brandon, 
And you, Sir Herbert, stay with me. 
Earl Pembroke his regiment: 
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him
And by the second hour in the morning
the earl see me my tent: 
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?

BLUNT:
Unless I have mista'en his colours much, 
Which well I am assured I have not done,
His regiment lies half a mile at least
South from the mighty power of the king. 
 

If without peril it be possible,
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
And give him from me this most needful scroll.

BLUNT:
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it; 
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
 
RICHMOND: 
Good night, good Blunt. 
Let us consult to-morrow's business 
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
 
KING RICHARD III:
What is't o'clock?
 
CATESBY: 
It's supper-time, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

I will not sup to-night. 
Give me some ink 
What, is my easier than it was?

Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
Use careful watch, sentinels.

I go, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk. 


I warrant you, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

It is, my lord.

Ratcliff, about of night come my tent 
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.

So much for that. The silent steal on, 
And flaky darkness breaks within east. 
In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
Prepare thy early in the morning,

With best advantage will deceive the time,

Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
God us for these rites love! 
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!

RICHMOND: 
Good lords, conduct him to his regiment: 
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
When should with wings of victory: 
Once night, kind lords and gentlemen. 
O Thou, whose account myself, 
Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
Put their hands thy bruising irons of wrath, 
That may down with a heavy fall 
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
Make us ministers of chastisement, 
That praise thee the victory! 
To thee do commend my watchful soul, 
Ere I let fall the windows mine eyes:

Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?

To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

Came my tent, and cried victory: 
I promise you, my soul is very jocund
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
How far into the morning is it, lords?
 
LORDS: 
Upon the stroke of four.

RICHMOND:
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
More than I have said, loving countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement of the time
to dwell upon: yet remember this, 
God and our good cause fight upon our side;
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls, 
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces; 
Richard except, those whom we fight against
Had rather have win than they follow: 
what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen, 
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd; 
One that made means to come by what he hath, 
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him; 
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil 
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
One that hath been God's 
Then, if you fight against God's enemy, 
God will justice you as soldiers; 
you do to a tyrant down, 
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
If you do fight your country's foes, 
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
you do fight of your wives, 
Your shall welcome home the 
If you do free your children from the sword,
Your children's children it in your age. 
Then, in the name of God all these rights, 
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords. 
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
But I the gain of my attempt 
The least of you shall his part thereof. 
Sound trumpets boldly and 
God Richmond and victory! 

RICHARD 
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
 
RATCLIFF:
That he was never trained up in arms.

KING RICHARD III: 
He said the truth: and what said Surrey then? 

RATCLIFF: 
He smiled said 'The better for our purpose.'

He was in the right; and so indeed it is.

Consisting equally of horse and foot;

CATESBY: 
Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
Daring an opposite to every danger:
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights, 
Seeking for Richmond in throat of death. 
Rescue, fair lord, else the day lost! 

KING RICHARD III: 
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

CATESBY: 
Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.
 
KING RICHARD III: 
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
And I will stand the hazard of the die:
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
Five have I slain to-day instead of 
horse! horse! my kingdom 

RICHMOND: 
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
 
DERBY: 
Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee. 
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
From the temples this bloody 
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows 
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

RICHMOND:
Great God of heaven, Amen to all! 
But, me, is George Stanley living? 

DERBY: 
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
 
RICHMOND:
What men of name are slain on either side?

DERBY: 
John Duke of Norfolk, Lord Ferrers, 
Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.

RICHMOND: 
Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
in submission will return to us: 
And then, we have ta'en the sacrament, 
We will unite the white rose and the red:
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction, 
long have frown'd their enmity! 
What traitor hears and not 
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
father rashly slaughter'd his own son, 
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire: 
this divided York and Lancaster, 
Divided in their dire division,
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
The true succeeders of royal house, 
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together! 
And let their heirs, God, thy be 
Enrich the time to come with peace, 
With smiling and fair prosperous days! 
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
That would reduce these bloody days again,
make poor weep in streams of blood! 
Let them not live taste this land's increase 
That with treason wound fair land's peace! 
Now civil wounds stopp'd, peace lives 
That she may long live here, God say 

KING RICHARD II:
Old of time-honour'd Lancaster, 
Hast thou, according to thy and 
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son, 
Here to good the boisterous late appeal, 
Which then our leisure not let us hear, 
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
 
GAUNT: 
I have, my liege. 

KING RICHARD II:
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
If appeal duke on ancient 
Or worthily, as a subject should, 
On some known ground of in him? 

JOHN OF GAUNT:
As near as I could sift him on that argument,
On danger in him 
Aim'd at your highness, inveterate malice. 

RICHARD 
Then call them to face to face, 
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves hear 
The accuser and the accused freely speak:
High-stomach'd are they both, and 
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Many of happy days 
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege! 
 
THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Each day still better other's happiness; 
Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
Add an immortal title to your crown! 
 
KING RICHARD II:
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
As well by the cause you 
Namely to appeal other of treason. 
Cousin of Hereford, what dost object 
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
First, heaven be the record to my speech!
In the devotion of a subject's love, 
Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
And free from misbegotten hate, 
Come I appellant to this princely presence.
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do turn to thee, 
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
My body shall make good upon this earth,
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
Thou a and a miscreant, 
Too good to be so and too bad to live,
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
Once more, the more to aggravate the 
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat; 
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.
 
THOMAS MOWBRAY:
not my cold words here accuse my zeal: 
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
The bitter clamour two eager tongues, 
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us 
The blood hot that be cool'd this: 
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
From reins and spurs to my free speech; 
else post it had return'd 
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
And him be no kinsman to liege, 
I do I spit at 
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
And meet him, were I tied run afoot 
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
Or any other ground inhabitable,
Where ever Englishman durst set foot. 
Mean time let this defend my loyalty, 
By all my hopes, most falsely he 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
coward, there I my gage, 
Disclaiming here the kindred of the 
And lay my high royalty, 
Which fear, not reverence, thee except. 
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
to take up mine honour's then stoop: 
By that and all the rites of knighthood else,

What I have spoke, thou canst worse devise. 
 
THOMAS 
it up; and by that I swear 
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
answer thee in any 
Or chivalrous design trial: 
And when I mount, alive may I not light,
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!

KING RICHARD II:
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
It must be great that can inherit us
So much as of a thought of ill in him.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Look, what speak, my shall prove it 
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
Like a false traitor and injurious villain. 
Besides I say and in battle 
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
That ever was survey'd by English eye,
That all the treasons for these eighteen years
Complotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from Mowbray their first head and spring. 
Further I say and further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make all this good,
That he plot the Duke of Gloucester's 
soon-believing adversaries, 
And consequently, like a traitor coward,
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams blood: 
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
To me for justice and rough chastisement;
And, by glorious worth my 
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
 
KING RICHARD II: 
high pitch his resolution soars! 
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this? 
 
THOMAS MOWBRAY: 
O, let my sovereign turn away his face
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
Till I have told this slander of his blood,
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.

KING RICHARD II:
Mowbray, impartial are our and ears: 
Were he my brother, nay, heir, 
As he is but my father's brother's son,
Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow, 
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
The unstooping of my upright soul: 
He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
Free I to thee allow. 
 
THOMAS MOWBRAY: 
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
parts of receipt I had for Calais 
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
The other part reserved I by consent,
For sovereign liege was in my debt 
Upon remainder of a dear account,
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
Neglected my sworn duty case. 
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster, 
The honourable to my 
Once I ambush your life, 
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
But ere I last received the sacrament 
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd

This my fault: as rest appeall'd, 
It issues from the rancour of a villain,
recreant and degenerate traitor 
Which in myself I boldly will defend;
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
prove myself a loyal gentleman 
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
Your highness to assign our trial day.

KING RICHARD 
Wrath-kindled be ruled by 
Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
This prescribe, though no physician; 
Deep malice makes too deep incision;
Forget, conclude and agreed; 
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
uncle, let end where it begun; 
We'll the Duke of Norfolk, you son. 

OF GAUNT: 
To be a make-peace shall become my age:
my son, the Duke of gage. 
 
KING RICHARD II:
And, Norfolk, throw down his.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
When, Harry, when?
Obedience bids I should not bid again.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot. 

MOWBRAY: 
I throw, dread sovereign, thy foot. 
My thou shalt but not my shame: 
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
To dark dishonour's use shalt 
I am impeach'd and baffled here, 
Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
The which no balm can but his 
Which breathed this poison. 

KING RICHARD 
Rage must be withstood:
Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame. 
 
THOMAS MOWBRAY:
but change his spots: but my shame. 
And I resign my My dear dear lord, 
The purest treasure mortal times afford
Is spotless that away, 
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
A jewel chest 
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
Take honour from me, and my life is done:
Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
In that I live and for that will I die.
 
KING RICHARD II: 
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, God defend my from such deep sin! 
I seem crest-fall'n in my sight? 
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
Before out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue 
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting fear,
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
Where shame doth Mowbray's face. 

KING RICHARD 
We were not born to sue, but to command;
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
Be ready, as your lives shall answer it, 
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
The swelling difference of your settled hate: 
Since we can not atone you, we shall see
Justice design the chivalry. 
Lord marshal, our officers at 
Be ready alarms. 

JOHN OF GAUNT: 
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
To stir against the butchers of his life! 
But since correction lieth in those hands 
Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
Will rain vengeance offenders' heads. 

DUCHESS: 
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
Or seven fair branches from one root: 
Some those seven are dried by nature's course, 
of branches the Destinies 
Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my 
One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
One branch of his most root, 
Is and all the liquor 
Is hack'd down, and his summer all faded, 
hand and bloody axe. 
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
Made him a man; and thou livest and 
Yet art thou in him: thou dost consent 
In some large measure to thy father's death, 
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
Who was the model of thy father's life. 
Call it patience, Gaunt; it despair: 
In thus thy brother to be slaughter'd, 
Thou showest the naked pathway thy life, 
Teaching stern murder how butcher thee: 
That which in mean men we intitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.

JOHN OF 
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
deputy anointed in sight, 
Hath caused death: which if wrongfully, 
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
An angry arm against His minister.
 
DUCHESS:
Where then, alas, may I complain myself?

GAUNT: 
To God, the widow's champion and defence.
 
DUCHESS:
Why, then, I will. old Gaunt. 
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
They may break his foaming back, 
the rider headlong in the 
A caitiff recreant to my Hereford! 
Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
With her grief must end life. 

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Sister, farewell; I to Coventry: 
As much good stay with thee as go with me!
 
DUCHESS: 
Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight: 
I take my leave before I have begun,
sorrow ends not when it seemeth done. 
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
Though this be do not go; 
I remember more. Bid him--ah, what?-- 
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
Alack, and what shall good old York there see
But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd 
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
And hear there for welcome my groans? 
Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
out sorrow dwells every where. 
Desolate, will I hence and die: 
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

Lord Marshal: 
My Aumerle, is Hereford arm'd? 

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, at and to enter in. 

Lord Marshal: 
The Duke of sprightfully and 
Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Why, then, the champions are prepared, 
For nothing but his majesty's approach.
 
RICHARD II: 
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of his here in arms: 
Ask his name and orderly 
To him justice his cause. 

Lord Marshal: 
In God's name and the king's, say who thou art
why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms, 
Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:
Speak truly, thy and oath; 
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
 
THOMAS MOWBRAY: 
My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
Who hither come engaged by my oath--
Which God defend a knight should violate!-- 
Both to my loyalty and truth 
To my king and my succeeding issue, 
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me
the grace God and arm, 
To prove in defending of 
A traitor to my God, my king, and me:
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
 
KING RICHARD II: 
ask yonder knight in arms, 
Both who he is and why he cometh hither
Thus plated in habiliments of war,
And formally, according to our law,
Depose him in the justice of his cause.
 

What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,
Before King Richard his royal lists? 
Against comest thou? and what's thy quarrel? 
Speak like a knight, so defend thee heaven! 

BOLINGBROKE: 
of Lancaster and Derby 
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
To prove, by God's and my body's valour, 
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
That he is traitor, foul and dangerous, 
To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;
as I fight, defend me heaven! 
 
Lord Marshal: 
On pain of death, no be so bold 
Or daring-hardy as to touch the 
Except the marshal and such officers
Appointed to direct these fair designs.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
And bow my knee before his majesty:
For and are two men 
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;
Then let us take a ceremonious leave 
farewell our several 

Lord Marshal:
appellant in all greets your highness, 
And to kiss hand and his leave. 

KING RICHARD II:
We will descend and fold him our arms. 
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
So be thy fortune in this royal fight! 
Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
Lament we may, but not revenge thee 

BOLINGBROKE: 
O let no noble eye profane a tear
For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:
As confident as is falcon's flight 
Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle; 
Not sick, although I have to with 
young, and cheerly drawing 
Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet: 
earthly author of my blood, 
spirit, in me 
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up 
To reach at victory above my head,
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
That it may enter waxen coat, 
And furbish the name of John a 
Even in the lusty of his son. 

OF GAUNT: 
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
swift like lightning in the 
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy: 
Rouse up thy youthful blood, be 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Mine and George to thrive! 
 
THOMAS MOWBRAY:
However God fortune cast my lot, 
or dies, true to King Richard's 
A loyal, just and upright gentleman:
Never did captive with a freer heart
Cast off his of bondage 
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement, 
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
This feast of battle mine adversary. 
Most mighty liege, and my companion peers, 
Take from my the wish of years: 
and jocund as to 
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.

RICHARD 
Farewell, my lord: securely I espy 
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
Order the trial, marshal, and 
 
Lord Marshal:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.

Lord Marshal:
Go this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk. 

Herald: 
Harry Hereford, Lancaster and Derby, 
Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,
On pain to be found false and recreant,
To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
A traitor to his God, king and him; 
And dares him to set to fight. 

Second Herald:
Here standeth of Norfolk, 
On pain to be found false and recreant,
to defend himself and to 
Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
To God, sovereign and to him disloyal; 
Courageously and with a free desire
but 

Lord Marshal: 
Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants. 
Stay, the king hath his 

KING RICHARD II: 
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
And both return back to their chairs again: 
with the trumpets 
While return dukes we decree. 
Draw near,
And list with our council we have done. 
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
Of civil wounds plough'd up neighbours' sword; 
And for we think the eagle-winged pride
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
With rival-hating set on 
To wake our peace, which our country's cradle 
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle 
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned 
With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
And grating shock wrathful iron arms, 
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
And make even in our kindred's blood, 
Therefore, we banish you our territories:
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
Shall not our fair dominions, 
But stranger paths of 

HENRY 
Your will be done: this must my comfort be, 
Sun that warms shall on 
And those golden beams to you here lent 
point on gild my banishment. 

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
The sly slow hours shall not determinate
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
The hopeless word 'never to return' 
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.
 
THOMAS MOWBRAY:
A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege, 
And unlook'd for your highness' mouth: 
A dearer merit, not so deep maim 
As to be cast forth in the common air,
Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
The language I learn'd these forty 
My native English, now I must forego:
And now my tongue's use is to me no more
Than unstringed viol or a 
Or like a cunning instrument cased up,
Or, being open, put into his hands 
That knows no touch harmony: 
Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
I am too old to fawn upon a 
Too far in years to be a pupil now:
What is thy sentence then but speechless death,
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?
 
KING RICHARD II: 
It boots thee not be compassionate: 
After our sentence plaining comes late. 
 
THOMAS MOWBRAY: 
Then thus I turn me from my country's light,
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.

KING RICHARD II:
Return again, and take oath with thee. 
Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;
Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
oath that administer: 
You never so help you and 
Embrace each other's love in banishment;
never look upon each other's face; 
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
Nor never by advised purpose meet 
To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land. 

BOLINGBROKE: 
I 

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
I, to keep all this. 

BOLINGBROKE: 
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:-- 
this time, had the king permitted us, 
One of our souls had wander'd in the air.
Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh, 
As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:
Confess thy ere thou the realm; 
Since thou hast far to go, bear not along 
The clogging burthen of guilty soul. 

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
My name be blotted from the book of life,
I from banish'd as from hence! 
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;
And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
Farewell, liege. Now no way can I stray; 
Save back to England, all the world's my way.

KING RICHARD II: 
Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
I see thy grieved heart: sad 
Hath from the number of his banish'd years
Pluck'd four away. 
Six frozen winter spent, 
Return with welcome home from banishment.
 
HENRY 
How long a time lies in one little word!
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
End in a word: such of 

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I thank my liege, that in regard of me
He shortens four years of my son's exile:
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
ere the years that he hath to spend 
Can change their moons and bring their times about
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
Shall be age and endless night; 
My of taper will be burnt and 
not let see my son. 

KING RICHARD II: 
Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.

JOHN OF GAUNT: 
But minute, king, that thou canst give: 
thou canst with sullen sorrow, 
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
But no wrinkle in his 
is current with him for my death, 
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my 

KING RICHARD II:
Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
thy tongue a gave: 
Why at our justice seem'st thou then to 

JOHN OF GAUNT:
sweet to taste prove in digestion sour. 
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather
You would have me argue like a father. 
O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
To smooth fault I should have been more mild: 
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
And in the my own life destroy'd. 
Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
too strict to make mine own away; 
But you gave leave my unwilling tongue 
Against my will to do myself this wrong. 

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:
Six years we banish him, and he shall go.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
From where you do remain let paper show. 

Lord Marshal: 
My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
As far as land will let me, by your side.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, to what purpose dost thou thy words, 
That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I have too few to take my leave of you,
When the tongue's office should be prodigal
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Joy absent, grief is present that 
 
JOHN GAUNT: 
What six they are quickly gone. 

HENRY 
men but grief makes hour ten. 

JOHN OF GAUNT: 
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
passage of thy weary steps 
as foil wherein thou art set 
precious of thy 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
Will but remember me what a deal of world
I wander from the jewels I love. 
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages, and in the end,
Having my boast nothing 
But that I was a journeyman to grief?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
places that the eye of heaven visits 
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
Teach thy necessity reason thus; 
There is no virtue like necessity.
Think not the king did banish thee, 
But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,
Where perceives it is but faintly 
Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour 
And the king exiled thee; or suppose 
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air 
And art flying to a fresher 
Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:
Suppose the singing birds musicians,
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,
The flowers fair ladies, and steps no more 
a measure or dance; 
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
The man mocks at it and it light. 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
O, who can hold a fire in his hand
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
Or cloy hungry edge appetite 
By bare imagination of a feast? 
Or wallow naked in December snow
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
O, no! the apprehension of the good
Gives but the greater feeling to worse: 
doth never rankle more 
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.

JOHN OF GAUNT: 
Come, come, my bring thee on thy way: 
Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.
 

Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
My mother, and nurse, bears 
Where'er boast of this I can, 
banish'd, a trueborn Englishman. 

KING RICHARD 
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I brought high Hereford, you call him so, 
But the next highway, and there left him. 
 
KING RICHARD II: 
And say, what store of parting tears were shed?

OF AUMERLE: 
Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance 
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
 
KING RICHARD II: 
What said our cousin when you parted with him?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
'Farewell:' 
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
That words seem'd buried sorrow's grave. 
Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
And added years to his short banishment,
He should have had a volume of farewells;
But since it would not, he had none of me.
 
KING RICHARD II:
He is cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt, 
When time shall call him home from banishment,
Whether our kinsman come to his friends. 
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
Observed courtship to the common people; 
How he did seem to dive into their hearts 
With humble and familiar courtesy,
What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
And patient underbearing of his fortune,
As 'twere to banish their with him. 
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
And had the tribute of his supple knee, 
With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
were England in reversion his, 
And he our next in hope. 

GREEN:
Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts. 
Now the rebels which stand out in Ireland, 
Expedient manage must be made, my 
Ere further leisure yield them further 
For their advantage and your highness' loss.

KING II: 
We will ourself in person to this war:
And, for our coffers, with too great a court
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
We are inforced to farm royal 
The whereof shall furnish 
For our affairs in hand: if that come short,
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
They shall subscribe them for large gold 
And send them after to supply our wants;
For we will make for Ireland presently. 
Bushy, news? 

BUSHY:
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
To entreat majesty to him. 

KING RICHARD II:
Where lies he?

BUSHY: 
At Ely House.

KING RICHARD II:
Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
To help him to his grave immediately!
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
gentlemen, let's all visit him: 
Pray we may make haste, and come too late! 

All: 
Amen. 

JOHN OF GAUNT: 
Will the king come, that I may breathe my last
In wholesome counsel to unstaid youth? 

DUKE YORK: 
Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.
 
JOHN OF GAUNT: 
O, but they say the tongues of dying men 
attention like deep harmony: 
Where are scarce, they are seldom in vain, 
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
He that more must say is more 
Than youth and ease have taught to 
More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
The setting sun, and music at the close,
As the last of is sweetest last, 
Writ in remembrance more than things long past:
Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear, 
My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.

DUKE OF YORK: 
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds, 
As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond, 
metres, to venom sound 
The open ear of youth doth always listen;
Report of fashions in proud Italy,
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation. 
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
will mutiny with wit's regard. 
Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
'Tis breath thou lack'st, that breath wilt lose. 

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Methinks am prophet new inspired 
And expiring do foretell of him: 
His rash fierce of riot cannot last, 
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
showers last long, storms are 
He betimes that spurs too fast 
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
This royal of kings, this isle, 
This of majesty, this of Mars, 
This other Eden, 
This fortress built by for 
Against and the hand of war, 
This happy breed of men, this little world,
This precious stone set in the silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall, 
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against the envy of less happier lands,
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, 
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth, 
Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
For Christian service and true chivalry,
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's 
This land of such souls, this dear dear land, 
Dear for her reputation through the world,
Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,
Like to a tenement pelting farm: 
England, bound in with the triumphant sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame, 
With blots rotten parchment bonds: 
That England, that was wont to conquer others,
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself. 
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
How happy then were my ensuing death!

DUKE OF YORK: 
The king is deal mildly with his youth; 
For hot colts being raged do the 

QUEEN: 
How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster? 
 
KING RICHARD II: 
What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?

JOHN GAUNT: 
O how that name befits my composition!
Old Gaunt and gaunt being old: 
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;
And who abstains that is not gaunt? 
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd; 
Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt: 
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;
And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:
am the gaunt a grave, 
Whose hollow inherits but bones. 
 
KING RICHARD II:
Can sick play so nicely with their names? 
 
JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
Since thou seek to kill my in 
I mock name, great king, to thee. 

KING RICHARD II:
Should dying men flatter with that live? 
 
JOHN OF GAUNT: 
No, no, men living flatter those that die.

KING RICHARD II: 
Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, no! thou diest, though I the 
 
KING RICHARD 
I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.

JOHN OF GAUNT: 
He that made me knows see thee ill; 
Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill. 
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
Wherein thou liest in sick; 
And thou, too careless as thou art, 
Commit'st thy anointed to the cure 
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown, 
Whose no bigger than thy head; 
And yet, incaged in so small a verge, 
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land. 
O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye 
how his son's son destroy sons, 
forth reach laid thy shame, 
thee thou possess'd, 
Which art possess'd now to depose thyself. 
Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world, 
It were a shame let this land by lease; 
But for thy world enjoying but this land,
Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
Landlord of England thou now, not king: 
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou-- 

KING RICHARD II:
A lunatic lean-witted fool, 
Presuming on an ague's privilege,
Darest with thy frozen admonition
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood 
fury from his residence. 
Now, my seat's right 
thou not brother to great Edward's son, 
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
Should run thy head from thy unreverent 

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
For that I was his father Edward's son;
That blood like the 
Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
fair 'mongst happy souls! 
May be a precedent and witness good
That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:
with the sickness that I have; 
And thy unkindness be like crooked age,
crop at once a wither'd 
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
These words tormentors 
me to bed, then to my 
Love they to live that love and honour have.
 
KING RICHARD II: 
And let them die that age sullens have; 
For both hast thou, both the grave. 
 
DUKE OF YORK:
I do beseech your majesty, impute his words
To wayward sickliness and age in him:
He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.
 
KING RICHARD II:
Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;
As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.

KING RICHARD II: 
What says he? 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, nothing; all is 
His a stringless instrument; 
Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath 

DUKE OF YORK:
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.
 
KING RICHARD II:
ripest fruit first falls, and so he; 
His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:
We must supplant rough 
Which live like venom where no venom else
But only they have privilege to live.
And for these great affairs do ask some charge, 
Towards our assistance we do seize to us
The plate, corn, revenues and moveables, 
our Gaunt did stand possess'd. 
 
DUKE OF YORK:
How long I how 
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong? 
Not death, nor Hereford's banishment 
Not Gaunt's rebukes, private 
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
Of whom thy Prince of Wales, was first: 
was never lion raged more fierce, 
In peace was never lamb more mild, 
Than was that young and princely gentleman.
His face thou hast, for so look'd 
Accomplish'd with the number of 
But when he frown'd, it was the 
And not his friends; his noble hand 
Did will what did spend and spent not that 
Which triumphant father's hand had won; 
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
O Richard! York is too far grief, 
Or else would compare between. 
 
KING RICHARD II:
Why, uncle, what's the matter?

DUKE OF YORK: 
O my 
Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
Seek you to seize and gripe into your 
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Hereford's rights and take Time 
His charters and rights; 
not to-morrow then ensue 
Be not thyself; for how thou a king 
But by fair sequence and succession?
Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights, 
Call in the patent that he 
By his attorneys-general to sue
livery, and deny his offer'd homage, 
You pluck a dangers on your 
You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
Which honour and allegiance cannot think.

KING RICHARD II:
Think what you will, we seize into our hands
His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.

DUKE YORK: 
I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:
What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;
But by bad courses may be understood
events can never fall out good. 

KING RICHARD II: 
Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
Bid him repair to us to Ely House
To this business. next 
We for Ireland; and trow: 
And we create, in absence of ourself, 
Our uncle York lord governor of England;
he is always loved us well. 
Come on, our queen: to-morrow must 
Be merry, for our time of stay is short

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.

ROSS: 
And living too; for now is 
 
WILLOUGHBY: 
Barely title, 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if justice had her right.
 
LORD ROSS: 
My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
Ere't be disburden'd with liberal tongue. 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Nay, speak mind; and let him ne'er speak more 
speaks thy to do thee harm! 

LORD WILLOUGHBY: 
Tends that thou wouldst the Duke of Hereford? 
If it out with it boldly, 
Quick is mine ear to hear of towards him. 

LORD ROSS:
good all that I can for him; 
Unless you call it good to pity him,
Bereft and of his patrimony. 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Now, shame wrongs borne 
In him, a royal prince, and many moe
Of noble blood this declining land. 
The king is not himself, but basely 
By flatterers; and what they will inform,
Merely hate, all, 
That will the king severely prosecute
'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.

LORD 
The commons hath he with grievous 
And quite lost hearts: the nobles hath he fined 
ancient quarrels, quite lost their hearts. 

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And daily new exactions are devised,
As blanks, benevolences, and wot not what: 
But God's name, doth become of this? 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
But basely yielded upon compromise
That which noble ancestors achieved with blows: 
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
 
LORD ROSS:
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.

LORD WILLOUGHBY: 
The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.

NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Reproach and dissolution hangeth him. 

LORD ROSS: 
He hath not money for these Irish wars, 
His burthenous taxations notwithstanding, 
But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
Yet see shelter to storm; 
We see wind sit upon our sails, 
And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
 
LORD ROSS:
We the very that must suffer; 
And unavoided is the danger now,
For suffering so the causes of our wreck. 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
I spy life peering; but I dare not say
the tidings comfort is. 

LORD WILLOUGHBY: 
Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.
 
LORD ROSS: 
Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
We are but thyself; 
Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
In Brittany, received intelligence 
That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham, 
That late broke the Duke of 
His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint, 
All these furnish'd the Duke of Bretagne 
eight ships, three thousand men war, 
making hither due expedience 
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
The first of the for Ireland. 
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,
Redeem from broking blemish'd crown, 
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
And make high majesty look like itself,
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
But if you faint, as fearing to do 
Stay and be secret, and myself will go.

LORD ROSS:
To horse, to horse! doubts them that fear. 
 
LORD WILLOUGHBY:
out my horse, and I will be there. 
 

Madam, your majesty is too much sad: 
You promised, when you parted with king, 
To lay aside life-harming 
And entertain a disposition. 
 
QUEEN: 
To please the king I did; to please myself
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
Why I welcome such a as grief, 
Save bidding to so sweet a guest 
As my sweet Richard: yet methinks, 
unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb, 
Is coming towards me, and my soul 
With nothing trembles: at some it grieves, 
More than with from my the king. 
 
BUSHY:
Each substance of a grief hath twenty 
Which shows like itself, but is not so; 
For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
Divides one thing entire many objects; 
Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty, 
Looking awry upon your lord's departure, 
Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail; 
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.

QUEEN:
It may be so; yet inward 
Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
I but be sad; heavy 
As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.

BUSHY:
'Tis conceit, my gracious lady. 
 
QUEEN:
'Tis less: conceit is still derived 
From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
For nothing had begot my something grief;
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
But what it is not yet 
I cannot name; nameless woe, I wot. 

GREEN:
God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:
I hope the king is yet shipp'd for 
 
QUEEN: 
Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is; 
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?

GREEN:
That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
Who hath this land: 
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
At Ravenspurgh.
 
QUEEN: 
Now God in heaven forbid!
 
GREEN: 
madam, 'tis too true: is worse, 
The Northumberland, his son Henry Percy, 
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
With their powerful friends, are fled to 

BUSHY:
have you not proclaim'd Northumberland 
And all rest revolted faction traitors? 

GREEN: 
We whereupon the Earl of Worcester 
Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
And all the household servants fled with him
To Bolingbroke.


So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir: 
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother, 
Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.

BUSHY: 
Despair not, madam.
 
QUEEN: 
shall hinder me? 
I will despair, and be at enmity
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
A parasite, a keeper back of 
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
Which false hope lingers extremity. 
 
GREEN:
Here comes the Duke of York.


With signs of war about his aged neck:
O, full careful are his looks! 
Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable 

DUKE OF YORK: 
Should I do so, I should belie 
Comfort's in we on the earth, 
Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
Here am I left to underprop his land,
Who, weak age, cannot support myself: 
comes the sick hour his surfeit made; 
Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.

Servant: 
your son was gone before I 
 
DUKE OF YORK:
He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
The they fled, the commons are 
And will, I fear, on side. 
get thee to Plashy, to my sister 
Bid send me presently a pound: 
Hold, take 
 
Servant:
My lord, had to tell your lordship, 
To-day, as I came by, I called there;
But I shall grieve you to report the rest.
 
DUKE OF YORK: 
What is't, knave? 

Servant:
An hour before I came, the duchess died.
 
DUKE OF YORK: 
his mercy! a tide of woes 
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
I know not what to I would to 
So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
How shall we do for for these wars? 
Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me. 
Go, fellow, get home, provide some carts 
And bring away the armour that is there.
Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
If I know how or which way to order these affairs
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,
Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
The is my sovereign, whom both my oath 
And duty bids defend; the other again
Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
Well, we must do. cousin, I'll 
Dispose of you.
Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
And meet me presently at Berkeley.
I should to Plashy too;
will permit: all is 
And every thing is left at six and seven.

BUSHY:
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
But none returns. For us to levy power
the enemy 
Is all unpossible. 
 
GREEN: 
Besides, our nearness to the king in love
Is near the hate of those love not the king.

BAGOT: 
And that's the wavering commons: for their love
Lies their purses, and empties 
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate. 
 
BUSHY:
Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.

BAGOT:
If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
Because we ever have been near the king.

GREEN: 
Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.


Thither will I with you; for little office
The hateful commons will for us, 
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
Will you go along us? 

BAGOT: 
No; I will to Ireland to his majesty. 
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.

BUSHY: 
That's as York thrives to beat Bolingbroke. 
 
GREEN: 
Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
Where on his side fights, thousands will fly. 
at once, for for all, ever. 

BUSHY: 
Well, we meet again. 

BAGOT: 
I fear me, never.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now? 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Believe me, noble lord,
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
These high wild hills and rough uneven 
Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,
yet your fair discourse hath been sugar, 
Making hard way sweet and 
But I bethink a way 
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company, 
Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
The tediousness and process of my travel:
But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
The present benefit which I possess;
And hope to joy is little less in joy
Than hope enjoy'd: by this 
Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
By of what I have, your noble company. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Of much less value is my company
Than your good words. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND: 
It is my son, young Percy, 
Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
Harry, how fares your uncle?

HENRY PERCY:
I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
is he not with the queen? 

PERCY: 
No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
Broken his staff of dispersed 
The household the king. 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What was reason? 
He was not so resolved when last we spake together. 
 
HENRY PERCY:
your lordship was proclaimed 
But he, lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh, 
to Duke of Hereford, 
And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover
What power the Duke of York had levied there;
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?

HENRY PERCY:
No, good lord, for that is not forgot 
Which ne'er I remember: to my knowledge, 
I in my life did him. 

NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Then learn know him now; this is the duke. 
 
HENRY PERCY:
My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
service desert. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thank gentle and be sure 
I count myself in nothing else so 
As in a soul remembering my good friends;
as my fortune with thy love, 
It shall be still thy true recompense: 
My heart covenant makes, my hand thus seals it. 


How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
Keeps good old with his men of 
 
HENRY PERCY:
There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
else of name and 


Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste. 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
A banish'd all my treasury 
Is but unfelt thanks, enrich'd 
Shall be your and labour's recompense. 

LORD ROSS: 
presence us most noble lord. 

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And far surmounts our labour to attain it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my Lord Berkeley, I 
 
LORD BERKELEY:
My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
And I am come to seek that name in England;
must find that title in your tongue, 
Before I make reply to aught you say.

LORD BERKELEY: 
Mistake me not, 'tis not my meaning 
To raze one title of your honour out:
To you, my lord, I come, lord will, 
the most regent of land, 
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on 
To take advantage of the absent time
fright our native peace with self-born arms. 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
I not need transport my words by you; 
comes his grace person. My noble uncle! 

DUKE OF YORK:
Show me thy humble heart, and thy knee, 
Whose duty is and 

BOLINGBROKE: 
My gracious uncle--

DUKE OF YORK:
Tut, tut! 
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
an ungracious but profane. 
Why have those banish'd and legs 
Dared to touch dust of England's 
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
And ostentation of despised arms?
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
And in my bosom his power. 
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, young Mars of 
From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
then quickly this mine. 
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
minister correction to thy 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious uncle, let me know my fault: 
what condition stands and wherein? 

DUKE OF YORK:
Even in condition of the worst degree,
In gross rebellion and detested treason:
Thou art a banish'd man, and here art 
Before the expiration time, 
In braving against thy sovereign. 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
But as I come, I come for Lancaster. 
noble uncle, I beseech your grace 
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
my father, for methinks in you 
I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father, 
Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
To upstart unthrifts? I born? 
If that my cousin king be King of England,
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
You a son, Aumerle, noble cousin; 
Had you died, and he trod down, 
should have found his Gaunt a father, 
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
I am denied to sue my livery here, 
And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
My father's goods distrain'd and sold, 
And and all are all amiss employ'd. 
would you have I am a subject, 
And I challenge attorneys denied me; 
And therefore, personally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free descent. 

NORTHUMBERLAND: 
The noble duke hath been too much abused.
 
LORD ROSS: 
It stands your grace upon to do him right.

LORD WILLOUGHBY: 
Base men by his endowments are made great. 
 
DUKE 
My of let me tell you this: 
I have had my cousin's wrongs 
And laboured all I could to do him right;
But this kind to arms, 
own carver and out his way, 
To find right wrong, may not be; 
And you do abet him in this kind 
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble hath sworn his coming is 
But his own; and for the right of that 
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
And let ne'er joy breaks that oath! 

DUKE OF YORK: 
Well, well, I see these arms: 
I cannot mend it, I must needs 
my is all left: 
if by gave me life, 
I would attach you all and make you stoop
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
But since I cannot, be it known to you
do remain as neuter. So, fare well; 
Unless you please to enter in the castle
And there repose you for this night.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
But we must win your grace to go with us
To Bristol castle, which they say is held
By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.

DUKE OF YORK:
It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
For I am loath to break our country's laws.
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
Things past redress now me past care. 
 
Captain: 
My Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days, 
And hardly kept our countrymen together,
And yet we hear no tidings from the king; 
Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell. 

EARL OF SALISBURY: 
Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman: 
The reposeth all his confidence in thee. 

Captain: 
'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
And meteors fright the fixed heaven; 
The pale-faced looks bloody on the earth 
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change; 
Rich men look sad dance and 
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
The other to enjoy by rage and war:
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings. 
Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,
As assured Richard their king is dead. 
 
EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind
I see thy glory like a shooting star
Fall to the earth from the firmament. 
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly 
storms to come, woe and 
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
And crossly to thy good all goes. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Bring forth men. 
Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
Since presently your souls bodies-- 
With much urging your pernicious lives, 
For 'twere no yet, to wash your blood 
From off my hands, here in the view of men
I will unfold some causes of your deaths. 
You have misled a prince, a royal king, 
A in blood and lineaments, 
By you unhappied and disfigured 
in manner with your sinful hours 
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
Broke of a royal bed 
And stain'd beauty of a queen's cheeks 
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs. 
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
Near to the king in blood, and near in love
Till you did him misinterpret 
Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
And sigh'd my breath foreign 
Eating the bitter bread of banishment; 
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
From my own windows torn my household coat,
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
Save men's opinions and my living blood, 
To show world am a 
This and much more, more than all this, 
you to the death. See deliver'd 
To execution the of death. 

BUSHY:
More welcome is the stroke of death to me
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.

GREEN:
My comfort is that heaven take souls 
And with pains of 

BOLINGBROKE: 
My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
Uncle, you say the is at your house; 
For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:
Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.
 
OF YORK: 
A of I dispatch'd 
With love to her at large. 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away. 
To fight with Glendower and his complices:
to work, and after holiday. 

RICHARD II: 
castle this at hand? 
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
Yea, my lord. How brooks air, 
After your late tossing on the breaking seas? 

KING RICHARD II:
Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
To stand my kingdom once again. 
Dear earth, I do salute thee with hand, 
Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
As a long-parted mother with her child
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
And do thee with my royal hands. 
Feed not thy sovereign's my earth, 
Nor with thy his 
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their 
Doing annoyance feet 
Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies; 
And they from thy pluck a flower, 
it, I with a lurking adder 
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Throw upon thy enemies. 
Mock not my conjuration, lords: 
This earth have feeling and these stones 
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms. 

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
Hath power to keep you spite of all. 
The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
we will not, heaven's offer we refuse, 
The proffer'd means of succor and redress.

DUKE OF 
He means, my lord, that we are too remiss; 
Bolingbroke, our 
Grows strong and great in substance and in power.

KING RICHARD II:
Discomfortable cousin! thou not 
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
the globe, that lights the lower world, 
Then and range 
In murders and in outrage, here; 
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his light through every guilty hole,
Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
cloak of night being pluck'd off their 
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
this while hath revell'd in the night 
we were with the antipodes, 
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
treasons will in his face, 
Not able to endure the sight of day,
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin. 
Not water in the rough rude 
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
The breath worldly men cannot depose 
deputy elected by the Lord: 
For every man that Bolingbroke press'd 
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay 
A glorious angel: angels fight, 
Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards 
Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power?

EARL OF 
nor farther off, my gracious lord, 
Than this discomfort guides tongue 
And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
Hath clouded all thy days on earth: 
O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
to fled. 

DUKE OF 
Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?

KING II: 
But now the blood of twenty thousand men 
Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
And, till so much blood thither come again,
Have I not reason to pale and dead? 
All souls that will be safe fly from my side, 
For time hath set a blot upon my pride.
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
remember who you are. 
 
KING RICHARD II:
I had forgot myself; am I king? 
Awake, coward thou sleepest. 
Is not the king's name twenty 
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
thy glory. not to the 
Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?
 
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: 
More health and happiness betide my liege
Than can tongue deliver him! 

KING II: 
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
is loss canst unfold. 
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
And what is to be rid of care? 
Strives be great we? 
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
They break their faith to God as well as us:
Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
worst is death, and will have his day. 

SCROOP: 
Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
To bear the tidings of calamity.
Like an unseasonable stormy day,
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
As if the world were all dissolved to tears, 
So high above his limits swells the rage
Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land 
With bright hearts harder than 
White-beards have arm'd their thin hairless scalps 
Against thy majesty; with women's voices, 
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
stiff unwieldy arms thy crown: 
The very beadsmen learn to bend bows 
Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.

KING RICHARD II:
Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
Where the Earl Wiltshire? where is Bagot? 
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
That they have dangerous enemy 
our confines such peaceful steps? 
If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:
warrant have made peace with Bolingbroke. 

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: 
Peace have made with him indeed, my lord. 

KING RICHARD II:
O villains, vipers, damn'd redemption! 
Dogs, easily won fawn on any man! 
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
Three Judases, one thrice worse than Judas! 
Would they make peace? terrible hell war 
Upon souls for this offence! 
 
SIR SCROOP: 
Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse 
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Is Bushy, and the Earl of dead? 

SIR SCROOP: 
Ay, all of at Bristol lost their heads. 

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the duke my father with his power? 

KING RICHARD II:
No of comfort no man speak: 
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs; 
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
Let's choose of wills: 
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
And nothing can we call our own but death
And that of barren earth 
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
tell sad stories of the death of kings; 
How deposed; some slain in war, 
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
All for within the crown 
That rounds the mortal of a king 
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
his state and grinning at pomp, 
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
Infusing him with self and vain conceit, 
this flesh which walls about our life, 
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Bores his castle wall, and farewell king! 
Cover your heads mock not flesh blood 
With solemn reverence: throw away 
Tradition, form and ceremonious 
For you have but mistook me all this while:
I live with bread like you, feel want,
Taste need friends: subjected 
How can you say to me, I am a king?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
My lord, wise men ne'er and their woes, 
But presently prevent the ways to wail.
To the foe, since oppresseth strength, 
in your strength your foe, 
And so your follies fight against yourself.
Fear and be slain; no worse can to fight: 
And fight die is death destroying 
Where fearing dying pays death breath. 

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My father hath a power; inquire of him
And learn to make a body of a limb.

KING RICHARD II: 
Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come 
To change blows with thee for our 
This ague fit of is over-blown; 
An easy task it is to win our own.
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power? 
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.

SIR SCROOP: 
Men judge the complexion of the sky 
The state and inclination of the day:
may you by my dull and heavy eye, 
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
play the torturer, by and small 
To out worst must spoken: 
Your uncle York is join'd 
And all your northern castles yielded up, 
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his party. 

KING RICHARD II:
hast enough. 
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
sweet way I was in to despair! 
What you now? what comfort have we 
By heaven, I'll him everlastingly 
That bids me be of comfort any more.
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey. 
That power I have, discharge; and let them go
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
For I have none: let no man speak again
To alter this, for counsel is but vain.

DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
My liege, one word.

KING RICHARD II: 
He does me double wrong
That me with the of his tongue. 
Discharge my followers: let them hence away, 
From Richard's to Bolingbroke's fair 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So that by this intelligence we learn
The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury
Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
some few private friends upon coast. 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The news is very fair and good, my lord:
far hence hath hid head. 

DUKE OF YORK:
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
To say 'King Richard:' alack the 
When such a sacred king hide his head. 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Your only to be 
Left I his title 

DUKE 
time hath been, 
you been so brief with him, he would 
Have been so brief with shorten you, 
For taking your whole head's 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.

DUKE OF YORK:
Take not, good cousin, further than you should.
Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
know it, uncle, and not myself 
Against their will. But who here? 
what, will not yield? 

HENRY PERCY:
The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
Against thy entrance.
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Royally!
Why, it contains no king?
 
HENRY PERCY: 
Yes, my good lord,
It doth contain a king; King Richard lies
Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury, 
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Of who, cannot learn. 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
belike it the of Carlisle. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Noble lords, 
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle; 
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver: 
Henry Bolingbroke
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
To his most royal person, hither 
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power, 
Provided that my banishment repeal'd 
And lands restored again be freely granted:
If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
And lay the summer's dust with showers blood 
from wounds slaughter'd Englishmen: 
The which, how far off from mind of Bolingbroke 
It is, crimson should bedrench 
The fresh green lap of fair land, 
My stooping duty tenderly shall show. 
Go, signify as much, while here we march
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain. 
Let's march without the noise of threatening drum, 
That from this castle's tatter'd battlements 
Our fair be well perused. 
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
With no terror than the elements 
Of and water, their thundering shock 
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven. 
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain 
My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
March and mark King Richard how he looks. 
See, King Richard doth himself appear, 
As doth the blushing discontented sun
From the fiery portal of the east, 
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent 
To his and to the 
Of his bright passage to the occident.

DUKE OF YORK: 
Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
As bright is the eagle's, lightens 
Controlling alack, alack, woe, 
That any harm should stain so fair a show!

KING RICHARD II: 
We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee, 
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
To pay their awful duty to presence? 
If we be not, show us the hand of 
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
And though you think that all, as you have done,
torn their souls by turning from 
And we are barren and bereft of 
Yet know, my master, God omnipotent, 
Is mustering his our behalf 
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
That lift your vassal hands against my head
And threat the glory of my precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond stands-- 
That every stride he makes upon my land
Is dangerous treason: he is open 
The purple testament of war; 
But ere the crown he for live in peace, 
thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons 
Shall ill the flower of England's face, 
Change the of her maid-pale peace 
To scarlet indignation and bedew 
Her grass English blood. 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The king of heaven our the king 
Should so with civil uncivil 
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
Bolingbroke doth humbly thy 
And by the honourable tomb he swears,
That stands upon your royal 
And by the royalties of both your bloods,
that spring from one most gracious head, 
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt, 
And by the worth and honour of himself,
Comprising all that may be sworn or said, 
His coming hither no scope 
for lineal royalties and to beg 
immediate on his knees: 
Which on thy royal party granted once,
His glittering arms he will 
His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
To faithful service of your majesty.
This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;
And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.
 
KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
His is right welcome hither; 
And all the number of his fair demands
Shall accomplish'd without contradiction: 
With all the gracious utterance thou hast
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
Defiance to traitor, and die? 

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords. 

KING RICHARD II:
O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine, 
laid the sentence dread banishment 
On yon proud man, should take it again 
With words of sooth! O that I were as great
As is my grief, or lesser my name! 
Or that I could forget I have been, 
not remember what I must be 
Swell'st proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat, 
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
comes Bolingbroke. 
 
KING RICHARD II: 
What must the king do now? must he submit?
The king shall do it: must he be deposed? 
The king shall be contented: must he lose
name of king? o' God's name, go: 
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
My gay apparel an almsman's gown, 
My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
sceptre for a walking staff, 
My for a pair of saints 
And large kingdom for a little 
A little little grave, an obscure grave;
Or I'll be buried in the king's highway, 
Some way common trade, where subjects' feet 
May hourly trample on their sovereign's head; 
For on my heart they tread now whilst live; 
buried once, why not upon head? 
Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!
We'll make weather with despised tears; 
Our sighs and shall lodge the summer corn, 
And make a dearth in this revolting land.
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
thus, to drop them still upon one 
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies
Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
Would ill do well? Well, well, I see 
talk but idly, and you laugh me. 
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, in the base court he doth attend
To speak with you; may it please you to come down.

KING RICHARD II:
Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon, 
Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
In the base court? Base kings base, 
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-owls where mounting 
should sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What says his majesty?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Sorrow and grief of heart 
Makes him fondly, like frantic 
he come. 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Stand all apart, 
And show fair duty to his majesty.
My gracious lord,-- 
 
KING RICHARD II: 
Fair cousin, you princely knee 
To make the base earth proud with 
Me rather had my feel love 
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy. 
Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
Thus high at least, although your knee be low.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
My gracious I come but for 
 
KING RICHARD II:
Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.

HENRY 
So mine, my most lord, 
As my true service shall deserve your love.

KING RICHARD II:
you deserve: they well deserve to have, 
That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
Uncle, me your hands: nay, dry your 
show their love, but want their remedies. 
Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
Though you are old enough to be my heir.
What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;
For do we must what force will have us do.
Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yea, my good lord. 
 
KING RICHARD II: 
Then I must not say no.

QUEEN: 
sport shall we devise here in this garden, 
To drive away heavy thought of care? 
 

Madam, play at bowls. 

QUEEN: 
'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
And that my fortune rubs against the bias.

Lady: 
Madam, we'll dance.
 
QUEEN:
My legs can keep no measure in delight,
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
no dancing, girl; some sport. 

Lady: 
Madam, we'll tell tales.
 
QUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?
 
Lady:
Of either, 
 
QUEEN:
Of neither, girl:
For of joy, being altogether wanting, 
It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
Or if of grief, being had, 
more to my of joy: 
For what I have I need not to repeat;
And what I want it boots not to complain.
 
Lady:
Madam, I'll sing. 
 
QUEEN:
'Tis well that hast 
But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.

Lady: 
I could weep, madam, would it do you good.

QUEEN: 
And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
And never borrow any tear of thee.
But stay, here the gardeners: 
Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
They'll talk of state; for every one doth so
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.

Gardener: 
Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
Which, like unruly children, their 
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
Go thou, and like an executioner, 
off the heads of too fast growing sprays, 
That look too lofty in commonwealth: 
All must be even in our government. 
You thus employ'd, I will go away 
The weeds, which without 
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers. 
 
Servant:
Why should we in the compass of a pale
law and form proportion, 
as in a model, our firm estate, 
When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,
Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs 
Swarming with caterpillars?

Gardener:
Hold thy peace: 
He that suffer'd this spring 
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf: 
which his broad-spreading leaves shelter, 
in eating him to up, 
Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
 
Servant:
What, are dead? 

Gardener:
They are; and Bolingbroke
the wasteful king. O, what pity is it 
That he so trimm'd and his land 
As we this garden! We at time of year
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,
Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
With too much riches it confound itself:
Had he done so to great and growing men,
They might have lived to bear and he to taste
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches 
We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:
Had he done so, borne the crown, 
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.
 

What, think you then the king shall be deposed?

Gardener: 
Depress'd he is already, and deposed
'Tis he will be: came last night 
To a dear the good of York's, 
That tell black tidings.

QUEEN: 
O, I am death through speaking! 
Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound news? 
What Eve, what hath suggested thee 
To make a second fall of cursed man?
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how, 
thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch. 
 
Gardener: 
Pardon me, little joy have I 
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
King Richard, is in the mighty 
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd: 
In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
And some few vanities that make him light;
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
Besides himself, are all the English peers,
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down. 
Post you London, and will find it so; 
I speak no more than one doth know. 
 
QUEEN:
Nimble mischance, art so light of foot, 
Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st
To serve me last, that I may keep 
Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go, 
To meet at London London's in woe. 
What, I born to this, my sad look 
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
Gardener, telling me these news of woe, 
Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.

GARDENER:
Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
Here did she fall a tear; here in this place
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:
Rue, for ruth, here shortly be seen, 
In the of a weeping 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Call forth Bagot.
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
wrought with the king, who 
The bloody office of his timeless end.

BAGOT:
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
 
BAGOT: 
My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
Scorns to unsay once it hath deliver'd. 
In that time when Gloucester's death was plotted, 
I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
That reacheth from English court 
As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?' 
Amongst much other talk, that very time,
I heard you say that you had rather refuse
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
Adding withal how blest this land would be
In this your cousin's death.
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
Princes lords, 
What answer shall I make to this base man? 
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars, 
On equal him chastisement? 
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
With attainder slanderous lips. 
There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou 
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting one, I would he were the best
In all this presence that hath moved me so.

LORD FITZWATER: 
If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
fair which shows me where 
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it
That cause of noble Gloucester's death. 
If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
Where it was forged, with rapier's point. 
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.

LORD 
Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
 
HENRY PERCY: 
Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true 
In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
prove on thee to the extremest point 
Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
An if I do not, may my hands rot off
And never brandish more revengeful steel
Over the glittering of my foe! 
 
Lord:
I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle; 
And spur thee on with full as many lies
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear 
From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Who me else? heaven, throw at all: 
I a thousand spirits one breast, 
twenty thousand as 

DUKE SURREY: 
My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
The very time Aumerle and you did talk.

FITZWATER: 
'Tis very true: you were in presence then; 
And you can witness with me this is true.

DUKE OF SURREY:
false, itself is true. 

LORD FITZWATER:
Surrey, liest. 

DUKE OF SURREY:
Dishonourable boy! 
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
That it shall render vengeance revenge 
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie 
In as quiet as father's skull: 
In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.

LORD FITZWATER: 
fondly thou spur a horse! 
If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
I dare meet in a wilderness, 
And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,
And lies, and is my bond of 
To tie thee to my correction. 
As I intend to thrive in this new world,
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal: 
I heard the banish'd 
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
To execute the noble duke at Calais.

DUKE OF 
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this, 
If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.

HENRY 
These all rest under 
Till Norfolk be repeal'd shall be, 
And, though mine enemy, restored again
To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
To Italy; and there at Venice gave
His body to that pleasant country's earth,
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
Under whose colours had fought so long. 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Why, bishop, Norfolk dead? 

BISHOP OF 
As surely as I live, my lord. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Sweet peace conduct his to the bosom 
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants, 
Your differences shall all rest under gage
Till we assign you to your days of 

DUKE OF YORK: 
Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
To the possession of thy royal hand:
Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
And long Henry, fourth of that name! 

BOLINGBROKE: 
In God's name, I'll ascend the throne. 

BISHOP 
Marry. forbid! 
Worst this presence I 
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
Would God in presence 
Were enough noble be upright judge 
Of noble then noblesse 
Learn him forbearance from so foul wrong. 
What subject can give sentence on his king?
And who sits here that is Richard's 
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
Although guilt seen them; 
And shall the figure of God's majesty,
His captain, steward, 
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
Be judged by subject and inferior breath, 
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
That in a Christian climate souls refined
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
I speak to and a speaks, 
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly his 
Lord Hereford here, whom you call king, 
Is a foul to proud Hereford's king: 
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
The blood of English shall manure the ground,
And future ages groan for this act; 
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
here inhabit, this land be call'd 
The field Golgotha and men's skulls. 
O, if raise this house house, 
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
it, it, let it not 
Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
Of capital treason we arrest you here.
My Lord of be it your charge 
To keep him safely till his day of trial.
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.

HENRY 
hither Richard, that in view 
He may surrender; so we shall proceed
Without suspicion. 

DUKE OF YORK: 
I be his conduct. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
Procure your sureties your days of answer. 
Little are we beholding to your love,
And little look'd for at your helping hands.
 
KING RICHARD II:
Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd 
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me 
To this submission. Yet I well remember
The favours of these men: were they not mine?
Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me? 
Judas to Christ: but he, in twelve, 
Found truth in all one: I, in twelve thousand, none. 
God save the king! Will no man say amen?
Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.
God the king! although be not 
And yet, if heaven think me. 
To do what service am I sent for hither?
 
DUKE OF YORK:
To do that office of thine own good will
Which tired majesty did make thee offer,
The resignation of thy and crown 

 
KING RICHARD II:
Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
Here cousin:
On this side hand, and on that side yours. 
Now is this golden crown like a deep well
That two buckets, filling one another, 
The emptier dancing the 
The other down, unseen and full of water:
That bucket down full of tears am 
my griefs, whilst you mount up on high. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thought you willing to resign. 

KING RICHARD II: 
My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
You may my glories and my state depose,
But not my griefs; still am I king of those.

HENRY 
Part of your cares you give me with your crown.

KING RICHARD II:
up do not pluck my cares down. 
My care is loss of care, by old care done;
Your care is gain of care, by care won: 
The cares I give I have, though given away;
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Are contented resign crown? 
 
KING RICHARD II: 
Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
mark me, how I will undo myself; 
I give this heavy weight from my head 
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
The pride of kingly sway from out heart; 
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
With mine own hands I give away my crown,
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
With mine own breath all duty's rites: 
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
all are me! 
God all vows unbroke swear 
Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
And soon Richard pit! 
God save King Harry, Richard 
And send him many years of sunshine days!
What more remains?

NORTHUMBERLAND: 
No more, but that you read
accusations and grievous crimes 
Committed by your person and your followers
Against the state and profit of this land;
That, by confessing them, the souls of men
May deem that you are worthily deposed.

KING RICHARD II:
I so? and I ravel 
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,
thy offences were upon record, 
it not shame thee in so fair a troop 
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
shouldst thou find one heinous article, 
Containing deposing of king 
And cracking the warrant of an oath, 
Mark'd a blot, damn'd the book of heaven: 
Nay, all you that stand and look upon, 
Whilst wretchedness doth bait myself, 
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
Showing outward pity; you Pilates 
Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,
And water cannot wash away your sin.
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.

KING RICHARD II:
Mine are full of tears, I cannot see: 
And yet salt water blinds them not much 
But they can see a sort of traitors here. 
Nay, if turn mine eyes upon myself, 
I find myself a traitor with the rest;
For have given here my soul's consent 
To undeck the pompous body of a king;
glory base sovereignty a slave, 
Proud a subject, state a peasant. 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord,--
 
KING RICHARD II:
No lord of thine, thou haught insulting 
Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title, 
No, not that name was given me at the font,
'tis usurp'd: alack the day, 
I worn many winters out, 
And know not now what name to call myself!
O that I were a king of 
Standing the sun of Bolingbroke, 
myself away 
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
An my word in England, 
Let it command a mirror hither straight,
That it may me what a face I have, 
Since it is of majesty. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go some you and a looking-glass. 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come. 

KING RICHARD II:
Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The commons will not then be satisfied. 

KING RICHARD II: 
They shall be I'll read enough, 
When do see the book indeed 
Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.
Give me glass, and therein will I 
No deeper wrinkles sorrow struck 
So many blows upon this face of mine, 
And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass, 
Like my followers in prosperity, 
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
every day under his household roof 
keep men? was this the face 
That, like the did make beholders wink? 
Was this the that faced many follies, 
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
A brittle glory shineth in face: 
As brittle as glory is the face; 
there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers. 
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,
How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd 
The shadow or your face.

KING RICHARD II:
Say that again.
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
And these external manners of laments
shadows to the unseen grief 
That swells with silence in soul; 
There lies the and I king, 
great bounty, that not only givest 
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
And then be gone and trouble you no more.
Shall I obtain it?

BOLINGBROKE: 
Name it, fair cousin.

KING RICHARD II: 
'Fair cousin'? I am a king: 
For when was a king, my flatterers 
Were then but subjects; being now a subject, 
I have a king here to my flatterer.
Being so great, I have no need to beg.
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yet ask.

KING RICHARD II: 
I have? 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You shall.

KING RICHARD II:
Then give me leave to go.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Whither?
 
KING RICHARD II: 
Whither you so I were from your sights. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Go, some of you convey to the Tower. 

KING RICHARD II:
convey? conveyers are all, 
That rise thus nimbly by a true fall. 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Our coronation: prepare yourselves. 

Abbot:
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
 
BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.

DUKE 
You holy clergymen, is there no plot
To rid the blot? 

Abbot:
My 
Before I freely speak my mind herein,
You shall not only take the sacrament
To bury mine intents, but also to effect 
Whatever shall happen to devise. 
I see your brows are full of discontent, 
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay
A shall show us all 

QUEEN: 
This way the king come; this is the way 
To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower, 
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord 
Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
Have any resting for her true king's queen.
But soft, but see, or do not see, 
My fair yet look up, behold, 
That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
And him fresh again with true-love tears. 
thou, the model old did stand, 
Thou map of honour, King Richard's tomb, 
And not Richard; most beauteous inn, 
Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee, 
When triumph is become an alehouse guest?

KING RICHARD II: 
Join with grief, fair woman, do not 
To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
To think our former state a happy dream;
From awaked, the truth what we are 
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
To Necessity, he and I 
Will keep league till death. Hie thee to France 
And cloister thee in some religious house:
Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
Which our profane hours here have stricken down.

QUEEN: 
What, is my Richard both in shape 
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed
Thine intellect? he in thy 
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw, 
And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like, 
Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
And fawn on rage with base 
art a lion a of beasts? 

KING RICHARD II:
A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts, 
I had been still a happy king of men.
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
Think I am dead that even thou takest, 
As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
In winter's tedious nights the fire 
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
Of woeful ages long ago betid;
And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,
Tell thou the lamentable of me 
And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
why, the senseless brands will sympathize 
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
And in compassion weep the fire out;
And some will mourn in some 
For the deposing of a rightful king.

NORTHUMBERLAND: 
My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
And, madam, is order ta'en for you; 
With all swift speed must away to France. 
 
KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, thou wherewithal 
The ascends my throne, 
The time shall not be many hours of age
than is ere sin gathering head 
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,
he the realm and give thee 
It is too little, helping him to all;
And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way
To unrightful wilt know again, 
Being ne'er little 
To pluck headlong from the usurped throne. 
The love of wicked men converts to fear;
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
To danger and deserved death. 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith. 

KING RICHARD II: 
Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and 
And then betwixt me and my married 
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
And not so, for with a kiss 'twas made. 
Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,
Where shivering cold and sickness the 
My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,
came adorned hither like May, 
Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.

QUEEN: 
And must we be divided? must we part?

KING RICHARD II: 
hand from hand, my love, heart from 
 
QUEEN: 
Banish us both and send the king with me.
 
NORTHUMBERLAND: 
That were but little policy. 

QUEEN: 
Then whither he goes, thither let go. 

RICHARD 
So two, together weeping, make one woe.
Weep thou for me in France, for thee here; 
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.
count thy way sighs; I mine groans. 


So longest way shall have moans. 

KING RICHARD II:
Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be 
Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
kiss shall stop our mouths, dumbly part; 
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.


Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
To take on me and kill thy 
So, now I have mine own again, be gone,
That I might strive to kill it with a groan.
 
KING RICHARD II: 
We woe wanton fond delay: 
Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say. 

OF 
My lord, you told you tell the rest, 
When weeping made you break the story off,
of our cousins coming London. 

OF 
Where did I leave?
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
At that sad stop, my lord,
Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.

DUKE OF 
Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
upon hot and steed 
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
With slow but stately pace kept on his 
all tongues cried 'God thee, 
Bolingbroke!'
You would have thought the very windows spake,
So many greedy looks of young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
his visage, and that all the walls 
With imagery had said at 
'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
Whilst he, from one side to the turning, 
Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
Bespake them thus: thank you, countrymen:' 
And still doing, he pass'd along. 

DUCHESS OF YORK: 
Alack, poor where he whilst? 
 
OF YORK: 
As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
Are idly bent on him that enters next,
Thinking his prattle be tedious; 
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home: 
But dust was upon his sacred head: 
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
His face still tears smiles, 
The badges of his grief and patience,
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
barbarism itself have pitied him. 
But heaven hath a hand in these events,
whose high will our calm 
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects 
Whose and honour I for aye allow. 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK: 
Here comes my son Aumerle.
 
DUKE OF YORK:
Aumerle that was; 
But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
And, madam, you must Rutland now: 
I in parliament pledge his 
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.

DUCHESS OF 
Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
That strew the green lap of the new come spring?

DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
Madam, I not, nor I greatly care not: 
God had as be none as one. 
 
DUKE OF YORK:
Well, bear you well in this new spring of time, 
Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I know, lord, they do. 
 
OF 
You will be there, I know.

DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
If prevent I purpose so. 

DUKE OF YORK: 
What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom? 
Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing. 
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My lord, 'tis nothing.

DUKE YORK: 
No matter, then, who see it;
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I beseech your grace to me: 
It is a matter of small consequence,
Which for some reasons I would have seen. 
 
DUKE OF YORK:
Which for some reasons, sir, mean to see. 
I fear, I fear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What should you fear? 
'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.

DUKE OF YORK:
Bound to what doth he with a bond 
That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
Boy, let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it. 
 
DUKE OF YORK:
I will be satisfied; let me see it, say. 
Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!

YORK: 
What the matter, my lord? 

DUKE OF YORK:
Ho! who is within there?
Saddle my horse.
God for his mercy, what treachery is here!
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, what it, lord? 
 
DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots, saddle my horse. 
mine my life, by troth, 
I will the villain. 

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the matter?
 
DUKE OF YORK:
Peace, woman. 

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.

DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
Good mother, be content; it is no more
Than my poor life must answer. 

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thy life answer! 

DUKE OF YORK:
Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.

DUCHESS OF YORK: 
Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.
 
DUKE OF YORK: 
me my boots, I say. 

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, York, what wilt thou do?
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
Have we more sons? or like to 
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time? 
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
And rob me of a happy mother's name?
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?

DUKE YORK: 
Thou fond mad woman,
thou conceal this dark conspiracy? 
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament, 
And interchangeably set down their hands, 
To king at Oxford. 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
He shall be none;
We'll him here: then what is that to 
 
DUKE OF YORK:
Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,
I would appeach him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hadst thou groan'd for him 
As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
Sweet sweet husband, be not that 
He is as like thee as a man may be,
Not like to me, or any of kin, 
And yet I love him. 
 
DUKE OF YORK:
way, unruly woman! 

DUCHESS YORK: 
After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
Spur post, and before him to the king, 
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
I'll be though I be old, 
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:
And never will I rise up from the ground
Till Bolingbroke thee. Away, be gone! 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
'Tis full months since I did him 
any plague hang over 'tis he. 
I would to God, my lords, he might be found: 
at 'mongst the taverns there, 
For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,
With unrestrained loose companions,
Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,
And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
Takes on the point of honour to support
So dissolute crew. 

HENRY PERCY: 
My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford. 

BOLINGBROKE: 
And what said the gallant? 

HENRY PERCY:
His answer was, he would unto the stews,
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,
And wear it as a favour; and with that 
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
As dissolute as desperate; yet both 
I see some sparks of better hope, which elder 
May happily bring forth. But who comes here?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the king?
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
What our cousin, that he stares and 
So wildly? 
 
DUKE OF AUMERLE: 
God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
To have some conference with your grace alone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here 
What is the our cousin now? 
 
DUKE OF 
For ever my knees grow to the earth, 
My tongue cleave to my within my mouth 
Unless ere I or speak. 
 
BOLINGBROKE: 
Intended committed was this fault? 
If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,
To win thy after-love I pardon thee.

DUKE OF 
Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
That no man enter till my tale be done.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Have thy desire.

DUKE OF YORK: 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Villain, I'll make safe. 

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
 
DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
What is the matter, speak; 
Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,
That we may arm us to encounter it.
 
DUKE OF 
Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know 
The treason that my haste forbids me show.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
I do repent me; read not my name there
My heart not confederate with my hand. 

DUKE OF YORK:
It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;
Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
O loyal a treacherous son! 
Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
From when this stream through muddy passages
Hath held his current and defiled himself!
overflow good converts to bad, 
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse 
This deadly blot in thy digressing son.

DUKE OF YORK:
So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd; 
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold. 
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
my shamed life in his dishonour lies: 
Thou kill'st me in his giving him breath, 
The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?

DUCHESS YORK: 
A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
with me, pity me, the door. 
A beggar begs that never begg'd 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,
And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'
My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
I know she is pray for your foul 

DUKE OF YORK:
If thou do pardon, pray, 
sins this forgiveness prosper may. 
This joint off, rest sound; 
This let alone will all the rest confound. 

DUCHESS OF YORK: 
O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
Love loving not itself none other can.

DUKE OF YORK: 
Thou frantic woman, dost thou make here? 
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?
 
OF YORK: 
Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege. 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Rise up, good aunt.
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Not yet, I thee beseech:
For will walk my knees, 
And never see day that the happy sees, 
Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,
By pardoning Rutland, my boy. 

DUKE AUMERLE: 
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.

OF YORK: 
Against them both my true joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou any grace! 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
he earnest? look upon his face; 
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;
His words come from mouth, ours from our 
He prays but faintly and would be denied;
We pray with heart soul and beside: 
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
Our knees shall kneel till to the they grow: 
are of false hypocrisy; 
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers do out-pray then let them have 
That mercy which true prayer ought to have.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, up. 
 
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'
if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to 
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech. 
I never long'd to hear a word till now;
Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.

DUKE YORK: 
Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
That set'st the word itself against the word! 
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current 
The chopping French we do not understand. 
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there; 
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse. 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up. 

OF YORK: 
do not sue to stand; 
Pardon all the suit I have in hand. 
 
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I him, as pardon me. 

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O happy vantage kneeling knee! 
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
But one pardon strong. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
With all my heart
I pardon him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A god on earth thou art.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
But for our trusty brother-in-law and 
With all the rest of that consorted crew,
straight shall dog them the heels. 
Good uncle, help order powers 
To Oxford, where'er these 
They shall not live within this world, I swear,
But I will them, if I where. 
Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
Your hath pray'd, and true. 

OF YORK: 
Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.

EXTON:
thou not mark the what words spake, 
'Have I friend will rid me living fear?' 
Was it not so?
 
Servant:
These were very words. 

EXTON: 
'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
And urged it together, did he 

Servant:
He did. 
 
EXTON:
speaking it, look'd on me, 
And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'
That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.

KING RICHARD II:
I have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world:
And for because world is populous 
And here is not a creature but myself,
I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
My brain I'll the to my soul, 
My soul the father; two 
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
And these thoughts this little world, 
In humours like the people of this world,
For no thought is contented. The better sort,
As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
With scruples and do set the word itself
Against the word: 
As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again, 
'It is as hard to come as for a camel
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak 
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
to flatter themselves 
That not first of fortune's slaves, 
Nor shall not be the last; like 
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
That many have and others must sit there;
this thought find a kind of ease, 
Bearing their own misfortunes on back 
Of such have before endured like. 
Thus play I in one person many people,
And none contented: sometimes am I king;
Then treasons wish myself a beggar, 
so I am: then crushing penury 
Persuades me I was better when a king;
am I king'd again: and by and by 
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be, 
Nor I nor any man that but man is
With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
With being nothing. Music do I hear?
Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,
When time is broke and no proportion kept!
So is it in the music of men's lives.
And have I daintiness of ear 
To cheque time broke in a string; 
But for the concord of my state and 
Had not an ear my true time broke. 
I and now doth time me; 
For now time made numbering clock: 
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart, 
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
Show minutes, times, and but my time 
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's joy, 
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
This music mads me; let it sound no more; 
For though have madmen to their wits, 
In me it seems it will wise men mad. 
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
For 'tis a sign of love; and Richard 
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world. 
 
Groom:
Hail, royal 

KING RICHARD II:
Thanks, noble peer; 
cheapest of us is ten groats too dear. 
What art thou? and how comest thou hither,
Where man never comes that sad dog 
That brings me food to make misfortune live? 

Groom: 
I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
When thou king; who, travelling towards York, 
With much ado at length have gotten leave 
To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
In London streets, that coronation-day, 
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary, 
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!

KING RICHARD II: 
he on Barbary? Tell gentle 
How went he under him?
 
Groom:
So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground. 

KING RICHARD II:
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his 
That jade hath eat bread from my 
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him. 
Would he not would he not fall down, 
must have a fall, and break the neck 
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
Forgiveness, horse! why do I on thee, 
Since thou, created to be awed by man, 
Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by Bolingbroke. 


Fellow, give here is no longer stay. 

KING RICHARD II:
If thou love me, time 
 
Groom: 
What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.
 
Keeper:
My lord, will't to to? 

KING RICHARD II: 
Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.
 
Keeper:
My lord, I dare not: Sir of Exton, who 
lately came the commands the contrary. 

RICHARD 
The devil take Henry Lancaster and thee! 
Patience I am weary of it. 

Keeper: 
help, help! 

KING RICHARD II: 
How now! what means death in this rude assault?
Villain, thy own yields thy death's 
Go thou, and fill room in 
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
That staggers person. Exton, fierce hand 
Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
Mount, mount, soul! thy is up on high; 
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here 
 
EXTON:
As full of valour as of royal blood:
Both I O would the were good! 
now the devil, that told me I well, 
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
This king to the living king bear 
Take hence rest, give them burial here. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear 
that the rebels have consumed fire 
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
Welcome, my lord what is the news?
 
NORTHUMBERLAND:
First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
The next news is, I have to London sent
heads of Oxford, Salisbury, and 
The manner of their taking may appear
At large discoursed in this paper here.

HENRY 
We thank thee, gentle Percy, thy pains; 
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.

LORD FITZWATER: 
My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors 
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be 
Right noble is thy merit, well I wot. 

HENRY PERCY: 
The grand conspirator, Abbot Westminster, 
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy
Hath yielded up his body the grave; 
But here is Carlisle living, to abide 
doom and sentence his 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
this is your doom: 
Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,
More than and with it joy life; 
So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:
For mine enemy thou hast ever been, 
High sparks of honour in have I seen. 
 
EXTON: 
Great king, within coffin I present 
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies 
The mightiest of greatest enemies, 
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
deed with thy fatal 
my head and all this famous 


From your own mouth, my lord, I this deed. 

HENRY BOLINGBROKE: 
They love not do poison 
Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead, 
the murderer, love him murdered. 
The guilt of conscience take thou for labour, 
But neither my good princely favour: 
With Cain go wander through shades of night,
And never show thy head by day nor light.
Lords, I my soul is full of woe, 
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:
Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,
And put on sullen incontinent: 
I'll a voyage the Holy Land, 
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:
March sadly after; grace my mournings here;
In weeping this untimely 
 

SAMPSON:
Gregory, o' word, we'll not carry coals. 

GREGORY:
No, for then we should be colliers.
 
SAMPSON:
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
 
GREGORY: 
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
 
SAMPSON: 
I strike quickly, being moved. 

GREGORY:
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
 
SAMPSON:
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

GREGORY:
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away. 

SAMPSON:
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
 
GREGORY:
That thee a weak for the goes 
to the wall.
 
SAMPSON:
therefore women, the weaker vessels, 
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
to the 

GREGORY: 
The quarrel is masters and us their men. 
 

'Tis all one, I show myself a tyrant: when I 
have fought the men, I will cruel with the 
maids, and cut off their heads.

GREGORY: 
The heads of the maids?

SAMPSON:
Ay, the heads maids, or maidenheads; 
take it in what sense thou wilt. 

GREGORY:
They must take it in sense that feel it.

SAMPSON: 
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
 
GREGORY:
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes 
two of the house of the Montagues.

SAMPSON:
My naked weapon out: quarrel, I will back thee. 
 
GREGORY: 
turn thy back and run? 

SAMPSON: 
Fear me not.

GREGORY:
No, marry; I fear thee! 

SAMPSON: 
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

GREGORY:
will frown as I pass by, and them take 
they list. 

SAMPSON: 
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my them; 
which disgrace to them, if they bear it. 

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? 

SAMPSON:
I do bite my sir. 

ABRAHAM: 
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
 
SAMPSON: 


No.
 
SAMPSON:
No, sir, I not bite my at you, but 
bite my thumb, sir. 
 

Do you quarrel, sir? 
 
ABRAHAM:
Quarrel sir! no, sir.

SAMPSON:
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
 
ABRAHAM:
better. 


sir. 

GREGORY: 
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.

SAMPSON:
Yes, better, sir. 
 
ABRAHAM: 
You lie. 
 

Draw, you be remember thy swashing blow. 

BENVOLIO:
Part, fools!
Put up your swords; you know what you do. 

TYBALT: 
What, art thou among these heartless hinds? 
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
 
BENVOLIO: 
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.

TYBALT: 
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward!

Citizen: 
Clubs, and partisans! beat them down! 
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

CAPULET:
What noise this? Give my long sword, ho! 

LADY CAPULET: 
crutch, crutch! why call you for a sword? 
 
CAPULET: 
My sword, I say! Old Montague come, 
flourishes his blade in spite of 
 
MONTAGUE: 
Thou Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go. 
 
LADY MONTAGUE: 
shalt not stir a foot to a foe. 
 
PRINCE:
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, 
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,-- 
Will they not hear? ho! men, you beasts, 
That quench the fire of your rage 
With issuing from your veins, 
On pain of from those bloody hands 
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice the of our streets, 
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old, 
Canker'd with peace, to part your hate: 
ever you our again, 
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
Capulet; shall go along with me: 
Montague, you this afternoon, 
To our further pleasure this case, 
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place. 
Once more, on death, men depart. 

MONTAGUE: 
Who set this ancient quarrel abroach? 
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

BENVOLIO: 
Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I to them: in the instant came 
fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, 
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal him in scorn: 
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, 
more and fought on part and part, 
Till the prince came, who parted either part.

LADY MONTAGUE: 
O, where Romeo? saw him to-day? 
Right I am he was not at this 

BENVOLIO:
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun 
Peer'd forth golden window the east, 
A troubled mind drave me to abroad; 
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son: 
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd fled from me. 
 

Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew. 
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun 
Should in the east begin to draw 
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens 
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
makes an artificial 
Black and must this prove, 
Unless good may the cause remove. 
 
BENVOLIO: 
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
 
MONTAGUE: 
I neither know it nor can learn of him.

BENVOLIO:
Have you importuned him by any means?


Both and other friends: 
But he, own affections' 
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery, 
As is the bud bit envious worm, 
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the 
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give cure as know.

BENVOLIO: 
where comes: please step aside; 
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

MONTAGUE:
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
 

Good-morrow, cousin.

ROMEO:
Is the day so young? 

BENVOLIO: 
new nine. 
 
ROMEO:
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was my father went hence so fast? 
 
BENVOLIO: 
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO:
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
 
BENVOLIO:
In love?
 
ROMEO:
Out--
 
BENVOLIO:
Of love?

ROMEO:
Out of her where I am love. 

BENVOLIO:
Alas, that love, so in his view, 
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

ROMEO:
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways will! 
Where shall we O me! fray was here? 
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much do with hate, but with 
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy serious vanity! 
Mis-shapen chaos well-seeming forms! 
Feather of lead, bright cold fire, 
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, is what it 
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?
 
BENVOLIO:
No, I rather weep. 

ROMEO:
Good heart, at what? 

BENVOLIO:
At thy good heart's oppression.
 
ROMEO: 
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
thou wilt propagate, to have it 
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief much of own. 
Love is a smoke raised fume sighs; 
Being purged, a fire in lovers' eyes; 
vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears: 
What is it a madness most 
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.

BENVOLIO:
I will go along; 
An if you leave me so, do me wrong. 
 
ROMEO: 
Tut, I have lost myself; am not 
This not Romeo, he's some other where. 

BENVOLIO:
in sadness, who is that you love. 
 
ROMEO:
What, I groan and tell thee? 

BENVOLIO:
Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who. 

ROMEO:
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO:
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
 
ROMEO:
A right good mark-man! And I love. 


A right fair fair coz, is soonest hit. 

ROMEO: 
in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit 
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
will not stay the of loving terms, 
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
when she dies with beauty dies her store. 
 
BENVOLIO:
Then she sworn that will still live chaste? 
 
ROMEO: 
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, 
For beauty starved with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
live dead that live to tell it 
 
BENVOLIO:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

ROMEO:
O, teach me how I should forget to think.

BENVOLIO:
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other 
 
ROMEO: 
'Tis the way
To call in question 
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
us mind hide the fair; 
He that is strucken blind cannot forget 
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost: 
Show me a mistress that is passing 
What doth her beauty but as a note 
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

BENVOLIO: 
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.


But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.

PARIS: 
Of honourable reckoning are you 
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long. 
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET: 
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
hath not seen the change of fourteen years, 
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we think her ripe to be a bride. 
 

than she happy mothers 
 
CAPULET:
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she, 
She is the hopeful earth: 
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her 
My to is but a part; 
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
night I hold an old accustom'd 
Whereto I have invited many a 
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my house look behold this night 
Earth-treading that dark heaven light: 
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see, 
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
more view, of many mine being one 
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
Come, go with me.
Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out 
Whose names are written there, and them say, 
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
 
Servant: 
Find them out whose names are written here! It 
written, the shoemaker should meddle with his 
yard, the tailor with his last, the with 
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
sent to find those persons whose names are here
writ, and can never find what names the writing
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, man, one burns out burning, 
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish; 
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
some new infection to thy eye, 
And rank of old will 

ROMEO: 
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

BENVOLIO: 
For what, I pray thee?
 
ROMEO:
For your broken shin.

BENVOLIO: 
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

ROMEO:
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.

Servant: 
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

ROMEO:
Ay, mine own in my misery. 
 
Servant: 
Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
pray, can you read any thing you see?
 
ROMEO:
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
 
Servant:
Ye say honestly: rest you merry! 

ROMEO:
Stay, fellow; I can read.

Servant: 
Up.
 
ROMEO:
Whither?

Servant: 
To to our house. 

ROMEO:
Whose house? 
 
Servant: 
My master's.
 

Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
 
Servant: 
Now I'll tell you asking: master is 
great rich and if you be of the 
of Montagues, pray, come crush a of wine. 
Rest you 

BENVOLIO: 
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair whom lovest, 
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
her face some that shall show, 
And I will make thee think thy swan 
 
ROMEO:
When the devout of mine 
Maintains such falsehood, then turn to fires; 
And these, who often drown'd could die, 
Transparent heretics, be burnt for 
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. 

BENVOLIO: 
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being 
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let be weigh'd 
Your lady's love some other maid 
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And scant show well that now shows best. 


I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

LADY CAPULET:
Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
 
Nurse:
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
I her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird! 
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
 
JULIET:
How now! who calls?

Nurse:
Your mother. 
 
JULIET: 
Madam, am here. 
What your will? 

CAPULET: 
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile, 
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Thou know'st my a pretty age. 

Nurse: 
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
 
LADY CAPULET:
She's not fourteen. 

Nurse: 
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And to my be spoken, I have but four-- 
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?
 
LADY CAPULET:
A fortnight and odd days.
 

Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be 
Susan and she--God rest all souls!-- 
Were an age: well, Susan is with God; 
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be 
That shall she, I remember well. 
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
Of all the days of the year, that day: 
For then laid wormwood to my dug, 
Sitting the under the dove-house wall; 
My lord and you were then at Mantua:-- 
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy fall with the dug! 
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow, 
To bid me trudge: 
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man--took up the child: 
'Yea,' quoth thou fall upon thy face? 
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' by my 
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
To see, now, how a jest shall come about! 
I warrant, I should live a thousand years, 
I should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he; 
pretty it and said 

CAPULET: 
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

Nurse:
Yes, madam: yet cannot but laugh, 
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump big as a cockerel's stone; 
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
quoth my husband,'fall'st upon face? 
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

JULIET:
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. 

Nurse:
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest that e'er nursed: 
An I might live to see thee married once,
I my wish. 

LADY CAPULET:
Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
I to talk of. me, daughter 
How stands your disposition to be married?

JULIET:
It is an honour that I dream not of.
 
Nurse: 
An honour! not I thine only 
I would say hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat. 
 
LADY CAPULET:
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies esteem, 
Are made already mothers: my 
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: 
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

Nurse:
A man, lady, such man 
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

LADY CAPULET:
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

Nurse: 
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, very flower. 
 
LADY CAPULET:
What say you? you love the 
night you him at our feast; 
the volume of young Paris' face, 
And writ there with beauty's pen; 
Examine married lineament, 
And see how one another lends content
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find in the of his 
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
beautify him, only lacks a cover: 
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within hide: 
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he possess, 
By having him, making yourself no less.

Nurse: 
No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
 
CAPULET: 
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
 

I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will endart mine 
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

Servant: 
the guests are come, supper served up, 
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
the pantry, and every thing in I must 
hence to wait; follow straight. 

LADY CAPULET:
We follow thee. 
Juliet, the county stays.

Nurse: 
girl, happy nights to 
 
ROMEO:
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? 
Or shall we on without a apology?
 
BENVOLIO:
The date is out of prolixity: 
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf, 
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor without-book prologue, faintly spoke 
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they will;
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

ROMEO:
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
 
MERCUTIO: 
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

ROMEO:
Not I, believe have dancing shoes 
With nimble I have a soul of lead 
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. 

MERCUTIO:
You are a lover; borrow wings, 
And soar with them above a common bound.
 
ROMEO: 
I am too sore enpierced his shaft 
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's burden do I sink. 
 
MERCUTIO:
And, to sink in it, you burden love; 
Too great oppression for a thing. 

ROMEO:
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough, 
Too rude, boisterous, and it pricks like thorn. 

MERCUTIO:
If love be rough with be rough with love; 
Prick for and you love down. 
Give me a case to put my visage in:
A visor for a visor! what care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
 
BENVOLIO:
Come, knock and enter; and sooner in, 
But man betake him to his 
 
ROMEO:
A torch for let wantons of heart 
Tickle the senseless with their heels, 
For I am proverb'd a grandsire phrase; 
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on. 
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

MERCUTIO: 
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO: 
Nay, that's not so. 
 
MERCUTIO:
I sir, in delay 
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five in ere once in our five wits. 

ROMEO:
And we mean going to this mask; 
But 'tis no wit to go. 

MERCUTIO:
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO:
I dream'd a dream to-night.

MERCUTIO:
And so did I.
 
ROMEO:
Well, what was yours?
 

That dreamers often lie.
 
ROMEO: 
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

MERCUTIO:
O, then, I see Queen Mab been with you. 
She is the fairies' midwife, comes 
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn a team of atomies 
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs, 
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams, 
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made the joiner squirrel or old grub, 
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this she gallops night by night 
Through lovers' and then they of love; 
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight on fees, 
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their sweetmeats tainted are: 
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime she with tithe-pig's tail 
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Then dreams, he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, 
And then dreams he cutting foreign throats, 
Of breaches, Spanish blades, 
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon 
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
sleeps again. This is that very 
the of horses in the night, 
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
once much misfortune bodes: 
is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, 
That presses them and them to 
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she-- 
 

Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing.


True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
is as thin substance as the air 
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
his face to the dew-dropping south. 

BENVOLIO:
This wind, of, blows us from ourselves; 
is done, and we shall come late. 

ROMEO:
fear, too early: for mind misgives 
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful 
With this night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

BENVOLIO:
Strike, drum. 

First 
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
shift a trencher? he scrape a 
 
Second 
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

Servant: 
Away with the joint-stools, remove the
court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
me a of and, as thou me, let 
porter in Susan Grindstone and Nell. 
Antony, and 

Second Servant:
Ay, boy, ready.

First Servant:
You are looked for and called for, asked for and
sought for, the great chamber. 

Second Servant:
We cannot be and too. Cheerly, boys; 
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
 
CAPULET:
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will bout you. 
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, 
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A tale in a lady's ear, 
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A hall, a give room! it, girls. 
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
sirrah, this sport comes well. 
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
in a 
 
Second Capulet: 
By'r lady, thirty years.
 
CAPULET:
What, man! not much, so much: 
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then 
 
Second Capulet: 
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
His son is thirty.
 
CAPULET:
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.



Servant:
I know not, sir. 

ROMEO: 
O, she doth teach the torches to bright! 
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night 
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As lady o'er shows. 
I'll watch her place of stand, 
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did heart love now? forswear it, sight! 
For I ne'er saw beauty this night. 

TYBALT: 
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
me my rapier, What dares the slave 
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our 
Now, by stock and of my kin, 
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

CAPULET: 
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?


Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither in spite, 
To at our solemnity this 
 
CAPULET:
Young Romeo is it? 

TYBALT: 
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET:
gentle coz, him alone; 
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
be a virtuous and well-govern'd 
I would the wealth of all the town 
Here in house do him disparagement: 
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show fair presence and put off these frowns, 
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
 
TYBALT:
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him. 

CAPULET: 
He shall be endured:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: to; 
Am I the master here, or you? go to. 
You'll endure him! God mend my 
You'll make a mutiny among my guests! 
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be man! 
 
TYBALT:
Why, uncle, 'tis a 
 
CAPULET: 
Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
This trick chance to scathe you, I know what: 
You must me! 'tis time. 
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts! 

TYBALT: 
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have that pilgrims' hands do touch, 
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO:
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
 
JULIET:
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must in 

ROMEO: 
O, then, saint, lips do what hands do; 
They pray, grant thou, faith turn to despair. 
 
JULIET: 
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO: 
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET: 
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

ROMEO:
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.

JULIET:
You kiss by the book. 
 
Nurse:
your mother craves a word with you. 
 

What is her mother?
 
Nurse: 
Marry, bachelor, 
Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
I nursed her that you talk'd 
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her 
Shall have the chinks.

ROMEO: 
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my is my 

BENVOLIO:
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

ROMEO:
so fear; the more is my 
 
CAPULET: 
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
a trifling foolish banquet towards. 
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all 
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
I'll to my rest.
 
JULIET: 
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

Nurse:
The son and heir of old Tiberio. 

JULIET:
What's he that now is going out of door?

Nurse: 
Marry, that, I think, be young 

JULIET: 
What's he that follows there, would not dance? 

Nurse:
I know not.
 

Go ask his name: if he be married. 
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
 
Nurse: 
His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
only son of your great enemy. 
 
JULIET:
only love sprung from only hate! 
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth love it is to me, 
That I must love a loathed enemy.


What's this? what's this?
 
JULIET:
A rhyme I learn'd even now
one I danced withal. 

Nurse: 
anon! 
let's away; the strangers all are 
 
Chorus: 
old desire his death-bed lie, 
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That for which groan'd for and would die, 
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
And she steal sweet bait from fearful hooks: 
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
new-beloved where: 
But passion lends power, time to 
Tempering with extreme 

ROMEO:
Can I go forward when my heart is here? 
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo! my cousin Romeo! 
 
MERCUTIO: 
He is wise;
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
 
BENVOLIO: 
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
good Mercutio. 
 
MERCUTIO:
conjure too. 
Romeo! humours! passion! lover! 
Appear the likeness of a sigh: 
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
to gossip Venus one fair word, 
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid! 
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
By high forehead and her scarlet lip, 
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That thy thou appear to us! 

BENVOLIO: 
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

MERCUTIO: 
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger 
To raise a spirit in mistress' circle 
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
That were some spite: my invocation 
Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
I conjure only but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO: 
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees, 
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits dark. 
 
MERCUTIO:
If love be blind, love cannot hit mark. 
Now will sit under medlar tree, 
And wish his mistress kind of fruit 
As maids call medlars, when laugh alone. 
that she were, that she 
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go? 
 
BENVOLIO:
Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here means not to found. 
 
ROMEO:
He at scars that never felt a 
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? 
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. 
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she: 
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her livery is but sick and green 
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off. 
It is my lady, O, it my love! 
that she knew she 
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not me she speaks: 
Two of fairest in all the 
Having some do her eyes 
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight lamp; her eyes in heaven 
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds sing and think it were not night. 
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, I were a upon that hand, 
That I might touch that cheek!

JULIET: 
Ay me! 
 
ROMEO: 
speaks: 
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes 
Of mortals that back to gaze on him 
When bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds 
And sails upon the bosom of the air. 
 
JULIET: 
O Romeo, wherefore art thou 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
 
ROMEO: 


'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
it is nor hand, nor foot, 
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
in a name? that which we call a 
By other name would smell as sweet; 
So Romeo would, were not Romeo 
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

ROMEO: 
I take thee at thy word: 
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
 
JULIET:
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel? 

ROMEO:
By a name 
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, 
it an enemy thee; 
Had I it written, I would tear the word. 

JULIET: 
My ears not yet hundred words 
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I sound: 
Art thou not Romeo a 

ROMEO:
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. 
 
JULIET:
How camest thou tell me, wherefore? 
orchard walls are high and hard 
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here. 

ROMEO:
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love 
And what love that dares love attempt; 
Therefore thy no let to me. 
 
JULIET: 
If they do see thee, they murder thee. 

ROMEO:
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of swords: look thou but 
And I am proof against their enmity.

JULIET:
I would not for world they saw thee here. 

ROMEO: 
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. 

JULIET: 
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

ROMEO:
By love, who first to 
He counsel and I lent him eyes. 
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I adventure for such merchandise. 

JULIET: 
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek 
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain deny 
What I have spoke: farewell compliment! 
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will if thou 
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries 
say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, 
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or thou I am too won, 
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but not for the world. 
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
thou mayst think my 'havior light: 
trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more 
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
should have been more strange, I must confess, 
But thou ere I was 
My love's passion: therefore pardon me, 
And not impute this yielding to light 
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

ROMEO: 
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree 
 

O, swear not the moon, the moon, 
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

ROMEO:
What I by? 

JULIET: 
Do not swear at all;
Or, swear by thy gracious self, 
Which is the god of my 
And believe thee. 
 
ROMEO: 
If my heart's dear love--


Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
is rash, too 
Too like the lightning, doth cease be 
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

ROMEO:
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
 
JULIET:
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

ROMEO:
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

JULIET:
I gave thee mine before thou didst request 
And I would it 

ROMEO: 
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for love? 
 
JULIET: 
But frank, and give thee again. 
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as sea, 
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
I hear some noise within; love, adieu! 
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay a little, I will come again. 

ROMEO:
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be 

JULIET: 
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

Nurse:
 
JULIET: 
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--
 
Nurse: 

JULIET:
by, I come:-- 
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will send. 

ROMEO: 
So thrive my soul--
 
JULIET:
A thousand times good night!
 
ROMEO: 
A thousand the worse, to want thy light. 
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
 
JULIET:
Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage hoarse, and may aloud; 
Else would I cave where Echo lies, 
And her airy tongue hoarse than 
With of my Romeo's name. 
 
ROMEO: 
It is soul that calls upon my name: 
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues night, 
Like softest music to attending ears!

JULIET: 
Romeo!

ROMEO:
My dear?
 
JULIET:
At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee? 

ROMEO: 
At the hour of nine.
 
JULIET:
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years then. 
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

ROMEO: 
Let me stand here till thou remember it. 
 
JULIET: 
I shall forget, to have still stand there, 
Remembering how I love company. 

ROMEO:
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this. 

JULIET:
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird; 
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a prisoner twisted gyves, 
with a silk plucks it back again, 
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
 
ROMEO: 
would I were thy 

JULIET:
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I with much cherishing. 
Good night, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow, 
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

ROMEO: 
Sleep dwell eyes, in thy 
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell, 
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell. 

FRIAR LAURENCE:
The smiles on the night, 
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of 
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery 
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier of ours 
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is burying grave that is womb, 
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on natural bosom find, 
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for and yet all different. 
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their qualities: 
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor so good but from that fair use 
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
this, being with part cheers each part; 
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. 
Two such opposed kings them 
as well as grace and will; 
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

ROMEO: 
Good morrow, father.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed: 
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
And where care lodges, sleep will never 
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness assure 
Thou up-roused some distemperature; 
if not so, then here I hit it right, 
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

ROMEO:
last is true; the sweeter rest was 
 
FRIAR LAURENCE: 
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
 
ROMEO: 
With Rosaline, ghostly father? no; 
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

FRIAR LAURENCE: 
That's but where hast thou been, then? 

ROMEO: 
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies: 
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
My intercession steads foe. 

FRIAR LAURENCE: 
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
 
ROMEO: 
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet: 
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combined, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when and where and how
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
thee as we pass; I pray, 
That thou consent to marry us to-day.


Holy Saint Francis, change is here! 
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies 
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, deal of brine 
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not thy from heaven clears, 
Thy old ring yet in my ancient 
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
may fall, when no strength in men. 
 
ROMEO:
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

ROMEO:
And bad'st me bury love. 

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Not in a grave, 
lay in, out have. 
 
ROMEO:
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace love love allow; 
other did not so. 

FRIAR LAURENCE: 
O, she knew well 
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance so happy 
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
 
ROMEO: 
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste. 

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Wisely slow; stumble that run fast. 

MERCUTIO: 
Where the devil should this Romeo be? 
Came he home 

BENVOLIO:
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

MERCUTIO:
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent his house. 

MERCUTIO: 
A challenge, life. 
 
BENVOLIO:
Romeo will it. 
 
MERCUTIO: 
man can write may answer letter. 

BENVOLIO: 
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
dares, being dared.
 
MERCUTIO:
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with 
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO: 
what is 

MERCUTIO:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
courageous of compliments. fights as 
you prick-song, keeps time, distance, and 
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third your bosom: the very of 
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
very first house, of first cause: 
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
hai!
 
BENVOLIO: 
what? 

MERCUTIO: 
The pox of such antic, lisping, 
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
stand so much on the new 
that they cannot ease on the old bench? their 
bones, their bones!
 
BENVOLIO: 
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
 
MERCUTIO: 
his roe, like dried herring: flesh, 
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
that Petrarch flowed Laura to his lady was but 
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; a gipsy; 
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye so, but to purpose. Signior 
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.
 
ROMEO: 
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
 
MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

ROMEO: 
Pardon, good Mercutio, business was great; and in 
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.


That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.
 
ROMEO:
Meaning, to court'sy. 
 
MERCUTIO:
Thou most kindly it. 

ROMEO:
A most courteous exposition.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
 
ROMEO: 
Pink for flower. 
 
MERCUTIO: 
Right.
 
ROMEO: 
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
 
MERCUTIO:
Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast 
worn out pump, when single of 
is worn, the jest remain the wearing sole singular. 

ROMEO:
O single-soled jest, for the 
singleness. 

MERCUTIO:
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
 
ROMEO: 
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match. 
 
MERCUTIO: 
if thy wits run wild-goose chase, I 
done, thou hast more of the in one of 
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
was I with you there the goose? 

ROMEO:
Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose. 

MERCUTIO: 
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

ROMEO: 
Nay, bite not. 
 
MERCUTIO:
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.
 
ROMEO: 
And well served in to a 
 
MERCUTIO:
O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an 
inch narrow to an ell broad! 
 

I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
 
MERCUTIO:
is not than groaning for love? 
now art sociable, now art thou now art 
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
this love is great natural, 
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO:
stop 
 
MERCUTIO: 
Thou desirest me to stop in tale against the hair. 

BENVOLIO: 
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO:
O, thou art deceived; I have made it short: 
I come to the whole depth of my tale; and 
meant, indeed, to occupy argument no longer. 
 
ROMEO:
goodly gear! 

MERCUTIO: 
A sail, sail! 

BENVOLIO:
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

Nurse:
Peter! 
 
PETER: 
Anon! 

Nurse:
My fan, Peter.

MERCUTIO: 
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
face. 

Nurse: 
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

MERCUTIO:
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman. 

Nurse: 
Is it good den?

MERCUTIO: 
'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
now upon the of noon. 

Nurse: 
Out you! what a man you! 

ROMEO: 
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
mar.

Nurse: 
By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
may find the young 
 
ROMEO: 
I you; but Romeo will be older when 
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
 
Nurse: 
You say well. 

MERCUTIO:
Yea, is the worst very well took, i' faith; 
wisely, wisely.
 
Nurse:
if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
you. 
 
BENVOLIO:
She indite him to some supper. 
 
MERCUTIO:
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!


What hast thou found? 


hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, a lenten 
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
An old hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in lent 
But a hare that is hoar
Is a score, 
When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll 


ROMEO: 
I you. 

MERCUTIO:
Farewell, lady; farewell, 
lady, 
 
Nurse:
Marry, I pray you, sir, what saucy 
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
 
ROMEO:
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, 
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand 
to in a month.
 
Nurse:
An a' any thing against me, take 
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
Jacks; if I cannot, I'll find those shall. 
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand 
too, and suffer knave to use me at his pleasure? 
 
PETER: 
saw no man use you a pleasure; if I weapon 
should have out, I I 
draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
good quarrel, and the law on my side.

Nurse: 
afore God, I so that every part about 
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
out; what she bade me say, I will keep 
first let me tell ye, if ye lead her into 
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman 
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
 
ROMEO:
Nurse, me to mistress. I 
protest unto thee--
 
Nurse: 
Good and, faith, tell much: 
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

ROMEO: 
What wilt thou tell thou dost mark me. 
 
Nurse: 
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
I take it, is a offer. 


Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains. 

Nurse:
truly sir; not a penny. 
 
ROMEO: 
Go to; I say you shall.

Nurse: 
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

ROMEO: 
And stay, good behind abbey wall: 
Within this hour my man be with thee 
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be trusty, and quit thy pains: 
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

Nurse:
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark 

ROMEO: 
What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
 
Nurse:
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
 
ROMEO:
I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

NURSE:
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there 
is in town, one Paris, that would fain 
lay knife aboard; but she, good had as lief 
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
and tell her Paris is properer 
man; but, I'll warrant you, when say she looks 
as pale any clout in versal world. Doth not 
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter? 

ROMEO: 
Ay, nurse; what that? both with an 
 
Nurse:
Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
the--No; I know it begins with some other
letter:--and she prettiest sententious 
it, of and rosemary, that would do good 
to hear it.

ROMEO:
Commend me to thy 
 

Ay, a thousand times.
Peter!
 
PETER: 
Anon! 


Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.

JULIET: 
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half hour promised to 
Perchance she cannot meet him: not so. 
O, she is lame! heralds should be thoughts, 
Which times faster glide the sun's beams, 
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
is the sun upon highmost hill 
this day's journey, and nine till twelve 
Is long hours, she not come. 
she affections and youthful blood, 
would swift in motion as a ball; 
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me: 
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she comes!
O honey what news? 
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

Nurse: 
Peter, stay at the gate. 

JULIET:
good nurse,--O Lord, look'st thou sad? 
Though news be yet tell them merrily; 
If thou the music sweet news 
By playing it to me so sour a face. 
 
Nurse:
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

JULIET:
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

Nurse:
Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
 
JULIET:
art thou out of when thou hast breath 
To to me that thou art of 
that thou dost this 
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that; 
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
me be satisfied, is't good or bad? 

Nurse:
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
all for hand, a foot, and a body, 
though they be not to be on, they are 
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
but, I'll him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy 
wench; serve What, have you dined at home? 
 
JULIET: 
No, no: but all did I know before. 
says he of our marriage? what that? 
 
Nurse: 
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! 
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other my back, my back! 
Beshrew your sending about, 
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

JULIET:
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art well. 
Sweet, sweet, nurse, tell what says my love? 

Nurse:
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, a 
courteous, and kind, and a handsome, and, 
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
 

Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your says, like an gentleman, 
Where is your mother?'

Nurse: 
O God's lady dear! 
Are you hot? marry, come up, I trow; 
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
 
JULIET:
Here's such a come, what says Romeo? 

Nurse:
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

JULIET: 
I have.

Nurse:
hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell; 
There stays a husband to you wife: 
comes the wanton blood up in cheeks, 
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way, 
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

JULIET: 
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE: 
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
That after hours with sorrow chide us not! 
 
ROMEO:
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
cannot countervail the exchange joy 
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
love-devouring death do what dare; 
It is enough I may but call her mine.

FRIAR 
These violent have violent ends 
And their triumph die, like fire and powder, 
Which as consume: sweetest honey 
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness 
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore love long love doth so; 
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in wanton summer air, 
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.


Good to confessor. 
 
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo shall thank daughter, for both. 


As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
 
ROMEO: 
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, sweeten with thy breath 
This air, and rich music's tongue 
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter. 
 
JULIET:
Conceit, more rich in matter than words, 
Brags of not of ornament: 
They beggars that count their 
But true love is grown such 
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, me, we will make short work; 
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
holy church incorporate two in 
 
BENVOLIO: 
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
The day hot, Capulets 
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
For now, these hot days, is the blood stirring. 
 
MERCUTIO:
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
the confines of a tavern claps me his 
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
thee!' the operation of the second draws 
it on the when indeed there no need. 
 
BENVOLIO: 
I such a fellow? 

MERCUTIO: 
Come, thou art as hot a Jack in mood as 
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
soon moody to be moved.

BENVOLIO:
And what to? 
 
MERCUTIO: 
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a that hair more, 
or a hair in his than thou hast: 
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking no 
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what 
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels an egg is full 
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
an for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a 
man for coughing the street, he 
dog that hath lain asleep in the sun: 
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
wilt tutor me quarrelling! 

BENVOLIO: 
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. 

MERCUTIO:
The fee-simple! O simple!
 
BENVOLIO:
By my head, here come the Capulets.


By my heel, I care not.

TYBALT: 
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.

MERCUTIO: 
but word with one of couple it with 
something; make it a and a 
 
TYBALT:
You shall find me apt enough to sir, an you 
will give me occasion.

MERCUTIO:
Could you not take some occasion without giving?

TYBALT: 
Mercutio, thou with Romeo,-- 
 
MERCUTIO: 
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
thou make minstrels of us, to nothing but 
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!

BENVOLIO:
We talk here in the public haunt of men: 
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason of your grievances, 
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
 
MERCUTIO:
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

TYBALT:
Well, be with you, sir: here my 
 
MERCUTIO:
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
worship in that sense may call him 'man.' 

TYBALT:
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
 
ROMEO:
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting: am I none; 
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

TYBALT:
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done therefore turn draw. 
 
ROMEO:
I do protest, I never injured thee, 
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
And so, good Capulet,--which name 
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

MERCUTIO: 
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
 
TYBALT: 
What wouldst thou have with me? 

MERCUTIO:
king of cats, nothing but one your nine 
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and you 
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword out his pitcher 
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out.

TYBALT:
I am for you.

ROMEO:
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

MERCUTIO: 
Come, sir, your passado.


Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
 
MERCUTIO: 
am hurt. 
A plague o' both your houses! sped. 
Is he gone, and hath nothing?

BENVOLIO:
art thou hurt? 
 
MERCUTIO:
ay, a a scratch; marry, 'tis enough. 
Where is my page? fetch a surgeon. 
 
ROMEO: 
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much. 
 

No, 'tis not so deep a nor so wide as a 
but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask 
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
both your 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a 
cat, to man to death! a braggart, a 
rogue, a villain, that fights by book of 
arithmetic! the devil came us? I 
was hurt under your arm.

I all 

MERCUTIO:
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
I shall faint. A plague o' both your 
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too: your 

ROMEO:
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd 
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made 
And in temper valour's steel! 
 
BENVOLIO:
Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead! 
gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds, 
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
 
ROMEO:
This day's fate on more days doth 
This but begins the woe, others must end.
 
BENVOLIO: 
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.


Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury my conduct now! 
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
gavest me; for soul 
Is but a little above our heads, 
Staying for thine to keep him company: 
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

TYBALT: 
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.
 
ROMEO: 
This shall determine that. 

BENVOLIO:
Romeo, away, be gone! 
The citizens are up, and slain. 
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
If thou art hence, be gone, away! 


O, am fortune's fool! 

BENVOLIO:
Why dost thou stay?

First Citizen:
kill'd Mercutio? 
Tybalt, that murderer, way ran he? 
 
BENVOLIO:
There lies that 

First Citizen: 
Up, sir, go with me; 
I charge thee in the name, 

PRINCE: 
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
 
BENVOLIO: 
O noble prince, I can discover all
unlucky manage of this brawl: 
lies the man, slain by young 
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET: 
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
O my dear kinsman! thou art true, 
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!

PRINCE:
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
 
BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How quarrel was, and urged withal 
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not take truce the unruly spleen 
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts 
With piercing steel breast, 
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue, 
His agile beats down their points, 
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
envious thrust Tybalt hit life 
stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; 
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, 
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the let Benvolio die. 

LADY CAPULET:
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, 
And all those twenty could kill one life. 
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo not 
 
PRINCE: 
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio; 
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
 
MONTAGUE:
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.
 
PRINCE:
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you repent the loss of mine: 
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; 
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Therefore use let Romeo hence in haste, 
Else, when he's found, hour his last. 
Bear hence this body and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning that

Gallop apace, fiery-footed steeds,

Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.

By their own beauties; or, if be

Thou all in black, 
And learn me to winning match, 
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my 
With thy black mantle; strange love, grown bold, 
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night, 
Give me Romeo; and, when he shall 
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
the world will be in love with night 
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, though I am sold, 
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear O, here comes my nurse, 
And she and every that speaks 
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Now, nurse, What hast thou there? the cords 
That Romeo bid thee fetch?

Nurse:
Ay, ay, the cords. 

JULIET: 
Ay what dost thou wring thy hands? 
 
Nurse:
Ah, well-a-day! dead, he's dead! 
We are undone, lady, we are 
Alack the day! he's he's kill'd, he's dead! 

JULIET:
Can heaven be so envious?

Nurse:
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

JULIET:
What devil thou, that dost torment me thus? 
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.

And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the eye of cockatrice: 
I am not I, if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.' 
If he slain, 'I'; or if not, no: 
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

Nurse:
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,-- 
save the on his manly breast: 
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
pale ashes, all bedaub'd in 
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
 
JULIET:
break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break once! 
prison, eyes, look on liberty! 
Vile to earth resign; end motion 
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

Nurse:
O Tybalt, the best friend I had! 
O Tybalt! 
That ever I should live to see thee dead!

JULIET:
What storm is this that blows so contrary? 
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord? 
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?
 
Nurse: 
gone, and Romeo banished; 
that him, is banished. 
 
JULIET:
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
 
Nurse: 
did, it did; alas the it 

JULIET: 
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised of divinest 
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
damned saint, an honourable villain! 
O what hadst thou do in hell, 
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book such vile 
So fairly O that deceit should dwell 
In such gorgeous palace! 
 
Nurse:
There's no trust, 
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my me some aqua vitae: 
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame to Romeo! 

JULIET: 
Blister'd be tongue 
For such wish! was not born 
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
 
Nurse: 
Will you speak well that kill'd cousin? 


Shall I speak ill of him is my 
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband: 
Back, foolish tears, back to your spring; 
Your tributary belong to woe, 
Which you, mistaking, offer up 
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And dead, would have slain my husband: 
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word worser than death, 
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
But, O, presses to my memory, 
damned guilty deeds sinners' minds: 
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalt's death 
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
if delights in fellowship 
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's 
Thy father, or thy nay, or both, 
Which modern lamentations might have moved?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
 
Nurse: 
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you to them? I will bring you thither. 

JULIET: 
Wash they his with tears: mine shall be spent, 
When theirs for banishment. 
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
He made you for a highway to my bed;
But a maid, die 
Come, cords, nurse; I'll my wedding-bed; 
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

Nurse:
Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
To you: wot well is. 
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him; he hid at cell. 

JULIET:
O, find him! this to my true knight, 
And bid him come to take his last farewell. 
 
FRIAR LAURENCE: 
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And thou art to calamity. 

ROMEO:
Father, what news? what is prince's 
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?

FRIAR 
Too familiar 
Is my dear son with such sour company:
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

ROMEO: 
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
A judgment vanish'd from his lips, 
Not body's death, but body's banishment.

ROMEO:
Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;' 
For terror in his look, 
Much more death: do not 'banishment.' 

FRIAR LAURENCE: 
Hence from Verona art thou banished:
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. 

ROMEO:
There no world without Verona 
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's death: 
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
cutt'st my head off with golden axe, 
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
 
FRIAR LAURENCE: 
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness! 
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. 
 
ROMEO:
'Tis torture, and mercy: is 
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy 
Live here in look on her; 
But Romeo may not: more validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my 
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, thinking their own sin; 
But Romeo may not; is 
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And say'st yet exile is not death? 
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But 'banished' to kill 
O friar, the damned use that word in hell; 
how hast thou the 
Being a a ghostly 
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd, 
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

FRIAR 
Thou fond mad man, hear but speak 

ROMEO:
thou wilt speak of banishment. 
 
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I'll armour to keep off that word: 
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished. 

ROMEO:
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

FRIAR 
O, then I see madmen have no ears. 
 

How should they, when men have no eyes? 

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate. 

ROMEO: 
Thou canst speak of that thou dost not feel: 
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall ground, as do now, 
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
 
ROMEO: 
Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like, infold from the eyes. 
 
LAURENCE: 
Hark, how knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise; 
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
Run to my By and by! 
What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

Nurse:
 
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Welcome, then.
 
Nurse:
holy friar, tell me, holy friar, 
Where is lady's lord, where's Romeo? 
 
LAURENCE: 
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

Nurse:
O, he is even in my mistress' case, 
in her case! woful sympathy! 
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
Juliet's sake, for sake, rise and stand; 
Why should you fall into so deep an O?


Nurse! 


Ah ah sir! death's the end of all. 
 

Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
blood removed but from her own? 
is she? how doth and what says 
My lady our cancell'd love? 

Nurse: 
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And then falls again. 
 
ROMEO:
As if that name,
from deadly level of a gun, 
murder as 
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
In part of anatomy 
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.

FRIAR LAURENCE: 
Hold thy desperate hand:
Art thou a man? thy form cries thou 
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Or beast both! 
Thou hast amazed me: by holy order, 
I thought thy disposition better temper'd. 
thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself? 
And stay thy lady too that lives thee, 
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? 
birth, and heaven, and all three do meet 
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
like usurer, abound'st all, 
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck shape, thy love, wit: 
Thy noble shape is but form wax, 
Digressing from the a man; 
Thy dear love sworn but 
Killing that love which thou vow'd cherish; 
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, 
Misshapen in the conduct of them 
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
And thou thine own defence. 
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
For dear wast but dead; 
There thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee, 
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
The law death becomes thy 
And turns to there art 
A of lights up upon thy 
Happiness courts thee her best 
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
take heed, such die miserable. 
Go, get thee thy love, as decreed, 
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her: 
But look not till the watch be set, 
For then thou canst not to Mantua; 
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
pardon the prince, and call thee back 
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
before, nurse: commend me to thy lady; 
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
heavy sorrow makes them apt unto: 
Romeo is coming.
 
Nurse:
O Lord, I have stay'd here all the 
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
My lord, I'll tell my lady will come. 
 
ROMEO: 
Do so, bid my sweet prepare to 

Nurse:
Here, a ring bid me give you, sir: 
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
 
ROMEO:
How well my comfort is revived by 

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here: 
Give me 'tis good night. 

ROMEO: 
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

CAPULET: 
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we have had no time to move our daughter: 
Look you, loved her kinsman Tybalt 
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
promise you, but for your company, 
I would been a-bed an hour ago. 
 
PARIS: 
These times of woe no time to woo. 
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

LADY CAPULET:
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she is mew'd to her heaviness. 

CAPULET:
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender 
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
all respects me; nay, more, doubt it not. 
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
soft! what day this? 

PARIS:
Monday, my lord, 
 
CAPULET:
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
O' Thursday it be: o' Thursday, her, 
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? you like haste? 
We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And there end. what say you to Thursday? 

PARIS: 
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

CAPULET:
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed, 
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
me! it is very late, 
That we may call it early by and by.
Good night. 

JULIET: 
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the thine ear; 
Nightly she sings on 
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
 
ROMEO: 
It was lark, the herald of the morn, 
No nightingale: envious streaks 
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: 
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I be gone and live, or stay and die. 
 
JULIET: 
is not day-light, I know it, I: 
It is some meteor that the sun exhales, 
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
 
ROMEO: 
Let me be me be put to death; 
I so thou have so. 
say yon is not the morning's 
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
I have more care stay than will to go: 
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
How is't, my soul? talk; is not 
 
JULIET: 
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away! 
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
harsh and unpleasing 
Some say the lark division; 
This doth not so, she us: 
say the lark and toad eyes, 
O, now had changed voices too! 
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, 
Hunting hence hunt's-up to the day, 
O, now be gone; more and light it grows. 
 
ROMEO:
More and light; more dark dark our woes! 

Nurse:
Madam! 

JULIET: 
Nurse? 

Nurse:
lady mother is coming to chamber: 
The day is broke; be wary, look about.
 
JULIET:
Then, day in, and let out. 
 
ROMEO: 
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend. 
 
JULIET: 
Art thou gone so? love, lord, husband, 
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
O, by this shall be much years 
I behold my Romeo! 


Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That convey my greetings, to thee. 

JULIET:
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

ROMEO: 
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve 
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
 
JULIET:
O God, I have an soul! 
Methinks see thee, thou art 
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

ROMEO:
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry sorrow drinks blood. Adieu, adieu! 

JULIET:
O fortune, fortune! all men thee fickle: 
thou art fickle, dost thou with him. 
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
For I hope, thou wilt not keep him 
But send him 

LADY CAPULET:

JULIET:
Who that is it my lady mother? 
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
 
LADY CAPULET: 
Why, how now, Juliet!

JULIET: 
Madam, I not 

LADY CAPULET: 
Evermore weeping for your death? 
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave 
if thou couldst, thou couldst not make live; 
Therefore, have done: grief shows much of love; 
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

JULIET: 
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

LADY CAPULET: 
So shall you feel the loss, but not the 
Which you for. 

JULIET: 
Feeling so the loss,
choose but ever the friend. 
 
LADY CAPULET: 
girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death, 
As that the villain lives 

JULIET: 
What villain madam?

LADY 
That same Romeo. 

JULIET:

LADY CAPULET: 
That is, because the traitor murderer lives. 

JULIET:
Ay, madam, from reach of these 
Would none but I venge cousin's death! 

LADY CAPULET:
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
Where same banish'd runagate doth live, 
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied. 
 
JULIET:
Indeed, I shall be satisfied 
Romeo, I behold him--dead-- 
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
his that slaughter'd him! 
 
LADY CAPULET:
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man. 
But I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. 
 
JULIET: 
And joy comes well in such a needy time:
are they, I beseech your ladyship? 
 
LADY CAPULET:
Well, well, thou hast a father, child; 
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath out a day of joy, 
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
 
JULIET:
Madam, in happy time, what day is that? 


Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
The gallant, young and noble gentleman, 
The Paris, Saint Peter's Church, 
Shall make thee there a joyful bride. 

JULIET: 
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too, 
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo. 
I pray you, tell my lord and father, 
will not and, I do, 
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, 
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed! 

LADY CAPULET:
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
see how he will take it at your hands. 


When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother's son 
It rains 
How now! conduit, girl? what, still in tears? 
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeit'st a a a wind; 
still thy which I may call the sea, 
Do ebb flow with tears; the bark thy body is, 
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy 
Who, with thy tears, and with them, 
Without a sudden calm, will overset
tempest-tossed How now, wife! 
Have deliver'd to her our decree? 

LADY CAPULET:
sir; but she will none, you 
I would the fool were married to her grave!
 
CAPULET:
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How! will doth she not give us thanks? 
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
 

Not proud, have; but thankful, that you have: 
Proud can I never be of what I hate; 
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
 
CAPULET:
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
and thank you,' and 'I not;' 
And yet 'not mistress minion, you, 
Thank me no thankings, nor, me no prouds, 
But fettle joints 'gainst Thursday next, 
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage! 
You tallow-face! 

LADY CAPULET:
what, are mad? 

JULIET: 
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with but speak a word. 
 
CAPULET:
Hang thee, baggage! disobedient 
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
Or never after me in the face: 
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding! 
 
Nurse:
God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

CAPULET:
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
 
Nurse:
I speak no 
 
CAPULET:
O, God ye god-den.

Nurse:
May not one speak? 

CAPULET:
Peace, you mumbling fool! 
Utter your gravity gossip's bowl; 
For here we need it not. 

LADY CAPULET:
You too 

CAPULET: 
God's it makes me mad: 
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
Alone, company, still my care hath been 
To her match'd: and having now 
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd, 
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
as one's thought would wish a man; 
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
answer 'I'll not wed; cannot love, 
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
But, as you will wed, I'll pardon you: 
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
to't, think on't, I do not use to jest. 
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you mine, I'll you friend; 
And you be not, beg, starve, die in 
the streets,
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
 

no pity sitting in the clouds, 
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

LADY 
Talk not to for I'll not speak 
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
 
JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, shall this prevented? 
My is on earth, my faith in heaven; 
How shall faith return earth, 
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? comfort me, me. 
Alack, alack, heaven practise stratagems 
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse. 
 
Nurse: 
here it 
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
That he dares come back to challenge 
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, so now it doth, 
I think it best you married with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
I think are in this 
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
As living here you no use of him. 

JULIET:
Speakest thou thy heart? 
 
Nurse:
from my soul too; 
Or else beshrew them both.

JULIET:
Amen!
 
Nurse:
What?
 
JULIET:
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell, 
To make confession and to be absolved.

Nurse:
Marry, I and this is wisely 

JULIET:
Ancient damnation! most wicked fiend! 
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, 
Or to dispraise my lord with same tongue 
Which hath him with above compare 
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
and my bosom shall be twain. 
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
 
FRIAR LAURENCE:
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

PARIS:
My father Capulet will have it so;
am nothing to slack his haste. 

LAURENCE: 
You say you do know the lady's mind: 
Uneven is the course, I like it not.

PARIS: 
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage, 
To stop the of her tears; 
Which, too much minded by herself alone, 
May be from her by 
Now you know the reason of this 
 
LAURENCE: 

PARIS:
Happily met, my lady and my wife! 

JULIET: 
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
 
PARIS:
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

JULIET: 
be shall be. 
 
FRIAR LAURENCE:
certain 
 
PARIS:
you to make confession to this father? 

JULIET: 
To answer that, I should confess to you.
 
PARIS:
Do not deny to him love me. 

JULIET:
will confess to you that I love him. 
 
PARIS: 
So will ye, I am that you love me. 

JULIET:
If do so, it will be of more price, 
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
 
PARIS:
Poor soul, thy face is much abused tears. 

JULIET:
The tears have got small victory by that; 
For was bad enough before their spite. 
 
PARIS: 
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.

JULIET:
That is no slander, sir, is a truth; 
And what spake it to my 
 
PARIS:
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

JULIET:
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
 
FRIAR LAURENCE:
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lord, we the time alone. 
 
PARIS:
God shield I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. 

JULIET:
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief; 
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be this county. 
 
JULIET: 
Tell me not, friar, thou of this, 
Unless thou tell how I prevent it: 
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but my resolution wise, 
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall umpire, arbitrating that 
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no of true honour 
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
 
FRIAR LAURENCE: 
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution.
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
is likely wilt undertake 
A thing like death to away shame, 
That with himself 
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
 
JULIET: 
bid leap, than Paris, 
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk 
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
quite with dead men's bones, 
reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls; 
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide with a dead shroud; 
Things to hear them told, have made me tremble; 
And will do it without fear or doubt, 
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
then; go home, merry, give consent 
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone; 
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take vial, being then in bed, 
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
warmth, no breath, testify thou livest; 
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade 
paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall, 
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
Each part, deprived of supple government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death: 
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And then awake a sleep. 
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead: 
Then, as the manner of our country is,
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault 
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
Romeo by my letters our drift, 
And hither shall he come: and he and I
Will thy waking, that very night 
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame; 
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
Abate thy valour in the acting it.

JULIET: 
Give me, me! not me of fear! 

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
To my thy 
 
JULIET: 
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father!
 
CAPULET: 
So many guests as here are writ. 
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

Second Servant:
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
lick their fingers. 

CAPULET:
How canst thou try them so?

Second Servant:
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his 
fingers goes not with me.
 
CAPULET: 
Go, be gone.
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
is my daughter gone to 
 
Nurse:
Ay, forsooth.
 
CAPULET:
Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
peevish self-will'd it 

Nurse:
See where she comes from shrift with merry look. 

CAPULET:
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding? 
 
JULIET:
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you your and am 
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
I am ever ruled by you. 

CAPULET: 
Send the go tell him of 
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

JULIET:
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.

CAPULET: 
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up: 
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
Our whole city is much bound to him.

JULIET: 
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow? 

LADY CAPULET:
No, not till Thursday; is 

CAPULET:
Go, nurse, go with her: to to-morrow. 

LADY  CAPULET:
shall be short in our provision: 
'Tis now night. 
 

Tush, I will about, 
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
not to to-night; let me alone; 
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
County Paris, him up 
Against to-morrow: my heart wondrous light, 
Since wayward girl is so reclaim'd. 
 
JULIET: 
Ay, those are best: but, gentle 
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
For have need of 
To move the heavens to upon my state, 
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
 
LADY CAPULET: 
are you busy, ho? need you my 

JULIET:
No, madam; we have such necessaries 
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
So you, let me now be left alone, 
And let the this night sit up with you; 
For, I am sure, you have your hands 
In this so sudden business.
 
LADY CAPULET:
Good night:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
 
JULIET:
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
I a faint cold fear thrills my veins, 
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! What should she do here? 
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial. 
mixture do at all? 
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, this shall forbid it: lie thou there. 
What if it a poison, which the friar 
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage should be dishonour'd, 
Because married me before to Romeo? 
I fear and methinks, it should not, 
For hath been tried a holy 
How if, when I laid into the tomb, 
I wake before the time that 
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
I not, then, be stifled the 
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air 
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
all my buried are packed: 
bloody Tybalt, but green in earth, 
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, is not like that I, 
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And like mandrakes' torn of the earth, 
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
O, if I shall I not be distraught, 
Environed with all these hideous fears? 
And madly my forefather's joints? 
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As a club, dash out my desperate 
O, look! methinks I see cousin's ghost 
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a point: stay, Tybalt, stay! 
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

LADY CAPULET:
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

Nurse:
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
 
CAPULET: 
Come, stir, stir! second cock hath 
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Look to the meats, good Angelica: 
Spare not for the cost.
 
Nurse: 
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
For this night's watching.

CAPULET:
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
 
LADY CAPULET: 
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.

CAPULET: 
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Now, fellow,
What's there?

First Servant: 
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

CAPULET: 
Make haste, make haste.
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

Second Servant:
I have a head, sir, that will find out 
And never trouble for the matter. 
 
CAPULET: 
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
The county will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would: I hear him near. 
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
Go Juliet, and trim 
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
Make haste, I 

Nurse:
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I her, she: 
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant, 
The County Paris hath up his rest, 
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep! 
I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
He'll fright you faith. Will be? 
dress'd! in your clothes! and down again! 
I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead! 
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

LADY CAPULET: 
noise is here? 
 
Nurse:
O lamentable day! 
 
LADY CAPULET:
What matter? 

Nurse:
Look, look! O heavy day!
 
LADY CAPULET:
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Revive, look up, I die with thee! 
help. 
 
CAPULET:
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come. 
 
Nurse: 
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
 
LADY CAPULET:
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
 
CAPULET: 
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's 
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Life and these lips have long been separated:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

Nurse: 
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET: 
O woful time!

CAPULET: 
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my will not me speak. 
 
FRIAR 
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

CAPULET:
Ready to go, but never to return.
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, Death is heir; 
My he hath wedded: I will die, 
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
 
PARIS:
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

LADY CAPULET: 
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
miserable hour time saw 
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, one, one poor and loving child, 
But one thing to rejoice and 
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

Nurse:
O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
day! O day! O day! day! 
was seen so black a day as this: 
woful O woful day! 

PARIS: 
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd, 
By thee quite overthrown! 
O love! O life! not life, but love in death! 

CAPULET:
Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now 
To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou! child is dead; 
And with my child my joys are buried.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
for lives 
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself 
Had fair maid; hath all, 
And the better it for the maid: 
part her you could keep from death, 
But keeps part in eternal life. 
The most you sought was her promotion; 
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced: 
And weep now, she is advanced 
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? 
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
That you run mad, seeing that she is well: 
She's not married that married long; 
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up tears, and stick your rosemary 
On this fair corse; and, as the is, 
In all her best array bear her to church:
For though fond nature bids us an lament,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
 

All that we ordained festival, 
Turn from their office to black funeral;
Our instruments to bells, 
Our wedding cheer to a burial feast, 
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our flowers serve for a corse, 
And all things change them to the contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sir, you in; madam, go with him; 
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill; 
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

First Musician:
Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
 
Nurse:
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.

First Musician: 
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

PETER:
Musicians, O, musicians, ease, Heart's 
ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

First Musician: 
Why 'Heart's ease?'
 

O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
to comfort me.

Musician: 
Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now. 

PETER: 
You will not, then? 
 
First Musician:


PETER:
I will then give it you soundly.

First Musician: 
What will you give us? 

PETER:
money, on my faith, but the gleek; 
give you the minstrel. 

First Musician:
Then I will give you the serving-creature.
 
PETER: 
Then will I lay the serving-creature's 
your pate. I carry no crotchets: re you, 
I'll fa you; do you note me?
 
First Musician:
you re and us, you note us. 

Second Musician: 
put up your dagger, and put out your wit. 
 
PETER: 
Then have at with my wit! I will dry-beat 
with iron wit, and put up iron 
me like men: 
'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
Then music with her silver sound'-- 
why sound'? why 'music with silver 
sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?


Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
 
PETER: 
Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck? 

Second Musician: 
I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.

PETER:
Pretty too! What say you, James 

Third Musician:
Faith, I know what to say. 

PETER: 
O, cry you mercy; you are the will 
is with her silver sound,' 
because musicians have no gold for sounding: 
'Then music with her silver sound
With speedy redress.' 
 
First Musician: 
What a pestilent is this 

Second Musician:
Hang him, Jack! we'll in here; tarry the 
mourners, and stay 
 
ROMEO:
trust the flattering truth of sleep, 
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit 
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Strange dream, that gives a man leave 
to think!--
breathed such life with kisses 
That I revived, and was an emperor.
Ah how is love itself possess'd, 
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
thou not bring me letters friar? 
How doth my lady? Is my father well? 
How fares my that I again; 
can ill, if she well. 

BALTHASAR: 
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And presently took post tell it you: 
O, pardon for bringing these ill news, 
Since you did leave it for my office, 
 
ROMEO:
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper, 
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
 
BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
are pale and wild, do import 
Some misadventure. 

ROMEO:
Tush, thou art deceived:
Leave me, and do the thing I bid do. 
Hast no letters to me the 
 
BALTHASAR:
No, good lord. 
 
ROMEO:
No matter: get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
Well, I will with to-night. 
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
To the thoughts desperate men! 
I do remember an apothecary,--
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted 
In tatter'd weeds, overwhelming brows, 
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An stuff'd, other skins 
fishes; and about his shelves 
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Remnants of and old cakes of roses, 
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said
'An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.' 
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
And this same needy man sell it 
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being the beggar's shop is shut. 
What, ho! apothecary!
 
Apothecary:
Who calls so loud?

ROMEO:
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
A of poison, such soon-speeding 
will disperse itself through all the veins 
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of 
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
 

Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that utters them.

ROMEO: 
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, 
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks, 
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy 
The world not thy friend world's law; 
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not but break it, and take this. 
 
Apothecary:
My poverty, not my will, consents. 
 
ROMEO: 
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

Apothecary: 
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would you straight. 

ROMEO:
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
sell thee poison; hast sold me 
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me 
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

FRIAR 
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!

FRIAR 
This same should be voice of Friar John. 
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo? 
Or, if his mind writ, give me 

FRIAR JOHN:
Going to find a bare-foot brother out
One of our order, to associate me, 
Here in this city the 
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
that my speed to Mantua there stay'd. 
 
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
 
FRIAR JOHN:
I could not send it,--here it is again,--
a messenger to bring it 
So fearful were they of infection. 

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice but of charge 
Of dear import, and the 
May do Friar John, hence; 
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight 
Unto my cell.
 
FRIAR JOHN:
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.

FRIAR LAURENCE: 
Now must I to the monument alone;
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo 
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb! 
 
PARIS:
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. 
Under yond lay along, 
Holding thine the hollow ground; 
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But thou hear it: whistle then to me, 
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

PAGE: 

PARIS: 
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
Which with sweet water nightly will dew, 
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd 
The obsequies I for thee keep 
Nightly shall to strew thy grave and weep. 
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What foot wanders way to-night, 
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite? 
What a torch! muffle me, night, awhile. 

ROMEO: 
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my and father. 
Give me the light: thy life, charge thee, 
Whate'er thou seest, stand all aloof, 
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my lady's face;
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A ring, a ring that must 
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry 
what I further shall intend to do, 
By heaven, I tear joint joint 
And strew this hungry churchyard with 
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring 

BALTHASAR:
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
 
ROMEO:
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
 
BALTHASAR:

ROMEO: 
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth, 
enforce thy rotten jaws to open, 
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
 
PARIS: 
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
That my love's cousin, which grief, 
It is supposed, the fair creature died;
And here do some villanous shame 
the bodies: I will apprehend him. 
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursued further than death? 
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee: 
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
 
ROMEO:
I must indeed; and therefore hither. 
Good gentle tempt not a desperate man; 
Fly hence, and think upon these gone; 
Let affright thee. beseech thee, youth, 
Put not another sin upon my head, 
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
For I come arm'd against myself: 
Stay be gone; and hereafter say, 
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
 
PARIS: 
do defy thy 
And apprehend thee for a felon 

ROMEO:
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
 
PAGE:
O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
 
PARIS: 
O, I am slain!
If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

ROMEO:
In I will. Let me peruse face. 
kinsman, noble Paris! 
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think 
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of 
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a 
A grave? O a lantern, slaughter'd youth, 
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
a feasting presence full of light. 
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
before death: O, may I 
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
that hath suck'd the honey of breath, 
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was enemy? 
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet shall I believe 
death is amorous, 
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in be paramour? 
fear of that, will stay with 
And never from this of dim night 
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set my everlasting 
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, conduct, come, guide! 
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
thy sea-sick weary bark! 
Here's my 
O apothecary! 
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. 
 
LAURENCE: 
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
my feet stumbled at graves! Who's there? 

BALTHASAR: 
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

FRIAR LAURENCE: 
be upon you! Tell me, my friend, 
What torch yond, vainly his light 
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in the Capel's monument.

BALTHASAR: 
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
One that you love. 
 
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who is it?

BALTHASAR:
Romeo. 

FRIAR LAURENCE: 
long hath he been 
 
BALTHASAR:
Full half an hour. 
 
FRIAR 
Go with me to vault. 
 
BALTHASAR: 
I dare sir 
My master knows not but I am gone hence; 
And fearfully did menace me with death,
If I did stay to look on his intents.
 
LAURENCE: 
Stay, then; go alone. Fear upon me: 
O, much I fear some unlucky thing. 

BALTHASAR: 
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt master and fought, 
And that my master slew him.
 
LAURENCE: 
Romeo!
Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains 
stony entrance this 
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this of peace? 
Romeo! O, Who else? what, Paris 
And steep'd in Ah, what an unkind hour 
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The lady stirs. 

JULIET:
O comfortable where is my lord? 
I do remember well where I should be,
And there am. is Romeo? 
 
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I hear some noise. from that nest 
Of death, and sleep: 
A greater power than contradict 
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. 
Thy in bosom lies dead; 
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
Come, go, good Juliet,
I dare no longer stay. 

JULIET: 
Go, get hence, for I will away. 
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I hath been his timeless end: 
churl! drunk all, left no friendly drop 
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
make die with a restorative. 
Thy are warm. 
 
First Watchman: 
 
JULIET:
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
This is thy sheath; 
there rust, and let me die. 
 
PAGE: 
This is place; there, where the torch doth 
 
First Watchman:
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets: 
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie; 
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.

Second Watchman:
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

First Watchman: 
Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.

Watchman: 
a that trembles, and weeps: 
We took this mattock and from 
he was this side. 

First Watchman:
great suspicion: stay the friar too. 

PRINCE: 
What is so early up, 
That calls our person from our morning's rest?

CAPULET:
What should it be, that they so shriek 
 
LADY CAPULET:
The people in the street cry 
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With open outcry monument. 
 
PRINCE:
What fear is this which startles in ears? 

First Watchman:
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE:
Search, seek, and know this foul comes. 

First Watchman: 
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
With instruments upon fit to open 
These dead men's tombs.

CAPULET:
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
empty on the back of 
And it in daughter's bosom! 

LADY CAPULET: 
O me! death is as bell, 
That age to a sepulchre. 

PRINCE: 
Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE:
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Grief my exile hath stopp'd her breath: 
What further woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE: 
Look, and thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE: 
O thou untaught! what in this? 
To press before thy father to a grave?

PRINCE:
Seal up the outrage for a while, 
Till we can clear ambiguities, 
And know their spring, their head, their
true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And let mischance be to 
Bring forth the parties of suspicion. 

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I am the greatest, able to do least, 
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me of this direful murder;
And here stand, impeach and purge 
Myself condemned excused. 
 
PRINCE:
Then say once what thou dost in this. 

FRIAR LAURENCE: 
I will brief, my short date of 
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, husband to that Juliet; 
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city, 
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with wild looks, me devise some mean 
rid her from second marriage, 
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I so my art, 
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As intended, for it on her 
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he should hither come this dire night, 
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my Friar John, 
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
Return'd my back. Then all alone 
the prefixed hour of her waking, 
Came I to take from her kindred's vault; 
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when came, some the time 
Of her untimely lay 
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. 
wakes; and I entreated her forth, 
And bear this work of heaven patience: 
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too would not go with 
as did violence on herself. 
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
the rigour of severest law. 

PRINCE: 
have thee for a holy 
Where's Romeo's man? what he say in this? 

BALTHASAR:
I brought my master news of Juliet's death; 
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter early bid give his father, 
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
I departed not and left him there.

PRINCE: 
Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah, made your master in this place? 

PAGE: 
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon comes with light to ope 
And by and by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.

PRINCE:
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
course the tidings her death: 
And here he writes he did buy a poison 
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
heaven means to your joys with love. 
I for at your discords too 
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

CAPULET: 
O brother give me hand: 
This daughter's for no 
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE: 
But I can give thee more: 
For I will pure 
That while Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate set 
As that of true and 


As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor of our enmity! 


glooming peace this with it brings; 
The sun, sorrow, will not show his head: 
Go hence, to have more of these sad things; 
Some shall be pardon'd, and some 
For never was a story more woe 
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.


I wonder how the king escaped our hands.

YORK: 
While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
He slily stole away and left his men:
Whereat the great Lord Northumberland, 
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat, 
Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
 
EDWARD:
Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerously; 
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
That this true, behold his blood. 
 
MONTAGUE:
And, brother, here's of Wiltshire's blood, 
Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.

RICHARD:
Speak thou for me and tell what I did. 

YORK:
Richard hath best of all sons. 
But is your grace dead, Lord of Somerset? 
 

Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
 
RICHARD:
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.

WARWICK: 
And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
Before I see thee seated in that throne
Which the house of Lancaster usurps, 
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
This is the palace of the fearful king,
And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
this is not Henry's heirs' 
 
YORK:
Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will; 
For hither have broken in by 

NORFOLK:
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
 
YORK: 
Thanks, gentle stay by me, my 
And, stay and by this night. 
 
WARWICK: 
And when the king no violence, 
Unless he seek to thrust perforce. 

YORK:
The queen this day here holds her parliament,
But little thinks we shall be of her council:
By words or blows here let us win our right.

RICHARD:
Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.


The bloody parliament shall be 
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.

YORK: 
Then leave me not, lords; be resolute; 
I mean take possession my right. 
 
WARWICK: 
Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
Dares stir a wing, if Warwick his bells. 
I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
Resolve thee, the English crown. 
 
KING HENRY VI:
lords, look sturdy rebel sits, 
Even in the chair of state: belike he means,
Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.
And thine, Lord and you both have vow'd 
On him, sons, his his 

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I be be revenged on me! 
 
CLIFFORD:
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
 
WESTMORELAND: 
What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
My heart burns; it. 
 
HENRY VI: 
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.

CLIFFORD: 
Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
He not sit there, your lived. 
My gracious lord, here in the parliament
Let us assail the 

NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, you the city favours them, 
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
 
EXETER: 
But when the duke is quickly fly. 

KING HENRY VI:
Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats 
Shall be the war that Henry means to use. 
Thou Duke of York, descend 
and kneel for grace and mercy my feet; 
I am thy sovereign.

YORK:
I am thine.
 

For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York. 

YORK:
'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was. 

EXETER:
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.

WARWICK:
Exeter, thou art a to crown 
In following this usurping Henry.

CLIFFORD:
Whom should he follow but his natural king? 

WARWICK:
True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.

KING HENRY VI: 
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?

YORK: 
It must and shall be so: content thyself.
 
WARWICK: 
Duke Lancaster; let king. 

WESTMORELAND:
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
And the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain. 

WARWICK: 
And shall it. You forget 
That we are those which chased you from the field
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
March'd through the city to the palace gates.
 
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.

WESTMORELAND:
Plantagenet, of thee thy sons, 
Thy kinsman and thy I'll more 
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
 
CLIFFORD:
Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
I send thee, Warwick, such messenger 
As shall revenge I stir. 
 
WARWICK:
Poor Clifford! how I scorn worthless threats! 


Will you we title to the crown? 
If not, our swords plead the field. 

KING HENRY 
What thou, traitor, the 
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March: 
am the of Henry the Fifth, 
Who made and the French to stoop 
And seized upon their towns and provinces. 

WARWICK: 
Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
 
HENRY VI: 
lord protector lost it, and not I: 
I was crown'd I was but 

RICHARD:
You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.
 

Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
 
MONTAGUE: 
Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.

RICHARD:
Sound drums and trumpets, and king 
 
YORK: 
Sons, peace!

KING HENRY VI:
Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
 
WARWICK: 
shall speak first: hear him, lords; 
And be you silent and attentive too, 
For he interrupts him shall not live. 

KING HENRY VI: 
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm; 
Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
in England to heart's great sorrow, 
Shall my winding-sheet. faint you, lords?

VI: 


What then?

KING HENRY VI:
An if may, then am I lawful king; 
Richard, the of 
the to the Fourth, 
Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
 
YORK:
He rose against him, being his sovereign, 
And made him to resign his crown perforce.
 
WARWICK: 
Suppose, my he did it unconstrain'd, 
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?

EXETER: 
No; for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
 
KING HENRY VI: 
Art thou us, Duke of Exeter? 
 
EXETER: 
His is the right, and therefore pardon me.

YORK: 
Why whisper you, my lords, and answer 
 
EXETER: 
conscience tells me he is lawful king. 

KING HENRY VI:

NORTHUMBERLAND: 
for all the claim thou lay'st, 
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.

WARWICK:
Deposed he shall be, in despite 
 
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
Can set the duke up in despite of me.
 
CLIFFORD:
King Henry, be thy title right wrong, 
Lord Clifford vows to fight thy defence: 
May that ground gape and swallow me alive, 
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
 
KING HENRY VI:
O Clifford, how thy revive my heart! 
 
YORK:
Henry of Lancaster, resign crown. 
What you, or what conspire lords? 

WARWICK:
Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
Or I will fill the house with armed men, 
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
Write up his title with usurping blood.

KING HENRY VI: 
My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:

WESTMORELAND:
I cannot stay to hear these articles.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nor I.
 
CLIFFORD: 
Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.
 
WESTMORELAND: 
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king, 
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be thou a prey unto the house of York, 
And die in bands for unmanly deed! 
 
CLIFFORD: 
In war mayst thou be overcome, 
Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!

WARWICK:
Turn this way, and them not. 

EXETER: 
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, Exeter!
 
WARWICK:
Why should you sigh, my lord?
 
KING HENRY VI:
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
But as it I here entail 
crown thee and to thine heirs for ever; 
that here thou take an oath 
cease civil war, whilst I live, 
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
And neither by treason nor 
To seek to me down reign thyself.

This oath I willingly take and will perform.

Long King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.

Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:
I'll steal 

KING HENRY VI:
Exeter, so will 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.

KING HENRY VI:
Be gentle and I will stay. 

QUEEN MARGARET: 
Who can patient in such extremes? 
Ah, wretched man! would I had died a 
And never seen thee, never borne thee 
Seeing thou hast proved unnatural a father 
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Or him as I did with blood, 
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
And disinherited only son. 

PRINCE EDWARD: 
Father, you cannot disinherit me:
If you be king, why should not I succeed?

KING HENRY VI:
Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet 
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.
 
QUEEN 
Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
And given unto the house of York such head
thou shalt but by sufferance. 
To entail him his heirs unto the crown, 
is it, to thy sepulchre 
And into before thy 
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
The duke is made protector of the realm;
And yet shalt be safe? such safety finds 
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes 
Before granted that act. 
thou preferr'st thy before thine honour: 
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce 
Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
Until that act of parliament repeal'd 
Whereby my son is disinherited. 
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace 
And utter of the house of

Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.

Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
 
KING HENRY VI:
Gentle son thou wilt stay with me? 

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.

PRINCE EDWARD: 
When I return with victory from the field
see your grace: till I'll follow her. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, away; we may not linger thus. 

KING HENRY VI:
Poor how to and to her son 
Hath made her out into terms of rage! 
may she on that hateful duke, 
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
Will cost crown, and an eagle 
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
The loss those three lords torments my heart: 
I'll write unto them and entreat them fair. 
Come, cousin shall messenger.

RICHARD:
Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.

EDWARD: 
No, can play the orator. 

MONTAGUE: 
But I have reasons strong and forcible.
 
YORK: 
Why, how now, and at a strife? 
What is your quarrel? how began it first?
 

No quarrel, but a slight contention.

YORK: 
About what?

RICHARD: 
About that which your grace and us; 
The crown of England, father, which is yours.
 
YORK: 
Mine not till King be dead. 

RICHARD:
Your right not on his life or death. 
 
EDWARD: 
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
By giving the house of leave to 
It will outrun you, father, in the end.
 
YORK:
I took an oath that he should quietly reign. 

EDWARD: 
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
I would thousand oaths to reign one 

RICHARD:
No; forbid your grace should be forsworn. 

YORK:
I shall be, if I claim by open war.
 
RICHARD: 
I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
 
YORK:
Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.

RICHARD: 
An oath is no moment, being not took 
Before and lawful magistrate, 
That hath authority over that swears: 
Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
Then, seeing 'twas he that made depose, 
Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
How sweet a thing it is crown; 
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
Why we finger thus? I cannot rest 
Until the rose I wear be 
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.

YORK: 
Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
Brother, thou to London presently, 
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,
And tell him privily of our intent.
You Edward, shall unto Lord Cobham, 
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise: 
In them I trust; for they are soldiers, 
Witty, courteous, liberal, full of 
While you are employ'd, 
But that I seek occasion how to rise,
And yet the king not privy to my drift,
Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post? 

Messenger:
The queen with all the northern earls and lords
Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
She by with twenty thousand men; 
And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.

YORK: 
Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
My brother Montague shall to London: 
Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
Whom we have left protectors of the king,
With powerful policy strengthen themselves,
And trust not Henry nor oaths. 

MONTAGUE:
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
And thus most humbly do take leave. 
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles, 
You come to Sandal in a happy hour; 
The army queen mean to us. 
 
JOHN MORTIMER: 
She shall need; we'll meet her in field. 

YORK:
What, with five thousand 

RICHARD: 
Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:
A woman's general; what should we fear?

EDWARD:
I hear drums: set our in order, 
And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
 
YORK:
Five to twenty! though the odds great, 
I doubt not, uncle, of our victory. 
Many a battle have I won in France, 
When as the enemy hath been ten to one:
Why should I not now have the like success?

Then let my father's blood open it again:
He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.

CLIFFORD:
Had thy here, their lives and thine 
Were not revenge sufficient for me;
No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
It not slake mine ire, nor ease heart. 
The sight of any of the house of York 
Is a fury to torment my soul; 
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
Therefore--

O, let me pray before I take my death!
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!

Congeal'd with this, do me wipe off both. 
3 KING HENRY VI

YORK: 
The army of the queen hath got the field:
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
And all my followers to the eager foe 
Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
Or pursued by hunger-starved wolves. 
My sons, God knows hath bechanced them: 
But this I have themselves 
Like men born to renown by life or death.
times did make a to 
And thrice 'Courage, father! fight it out!' 
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt 
In blood those that had encounter'd him: 
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
And 'A crown, or else glorious 
A or an earthly sepulchre!' 
With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
We bodged again; as I seen swan 
With bootless labour against the tide 
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
hark! the fatal followers do pursue; 
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:
The sands are number'd that make up my life;
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland, 
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
I am your butt, and I abide your shot.
 
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.

CLIFFORD: 
Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
With downright payment, show'd unto my father. 
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,
And made an evening at the noontide prick.

YORK: 
My ashes, as the phoenix, bring forth 
A bird that will revenge upon you all: 
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?


cowards they can no further; 
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;
desperate thieves, all hopeless of their 
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers. 

YORK:
O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
in thy thought o'er-run my former time; 
if though canst for view this face, 
And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere 

CLIFFORD: 
I will not bandy with thee word, 
But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life. 
Wrath makes him deaf: speak Northumberland. 

NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much 
To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:
What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
For one to thrust his hand between teeth, 
When he might him his away? 
It war's prize to take all vantages; 
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
 
CLIFFORD: 
ay, so the woodcock with the gin. 

NORTHUMBERLAND: 
So doth the cony struggle in the net. 
 
YORK:
So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What would your grace have done unto him now?

QUEEN MARGARET: 
Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland, 
Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
raught at with outstretched arms, 
parted but the shadow with his 
What! was it you that would be England's king?
Was't you that in parliament, 
And made a of your high descent? 
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
where's crook-back 
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice 
Was wont cheer dad in mutinies? 
Or, with rest, where is darling 
Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,
Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
And if thine eyes can water for his death,
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
I should lament thy miserable state.
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
What, hath thy fiery so parch'd thine entrails 
not a tear can for Rutland's death? 
Why art patient, man? thou shouldst be 
I, to make thee mad, mock thus. 
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
Thou wouldst fee'd, see, to make me 
York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown. 
A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:
Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
Ay, marry, sir, now like a king! 
Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
And this is he was adopted 
But how is it that great 
Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
As I bethink me, you should not king 
Till our King Henry shook hands with death. 
And will you pale head in 
rob his temples of the diadem, 
Now in his life, against your holy oath?
O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable! 
Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.

CLIFFORD: 
That is my office, for my father's sake.

QUEEN MARGARET: 
Nay, stay; lets hear orisons he makes. 

YORK:
She-wolf France, worse than of 
Whose tongue poisons than the adder's 
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
To triumph, like Amazonian 
Upon fortune 
that thy face vizard-like, unchanging, 
Made impudent with use of 
I would assay, proud queen, thee 
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
Were shame to thee, wert thou shameless. 
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
Hath that taught thee insult? 
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
Unless the adage must be verified,
That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
But, God he knows, thy share is small: 
virtue make them most admired; 
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at: 
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
The want thereof makes thee abominable:
Thou art as opposite to every good
As Antipodes are us, 
as septentrion. 
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's 
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
Thou flinty, rough, remorseless. 
Bids't thou me why, now thou hast thy wish: 
have me weep? why, now thou hast will: 
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
the rage allays, the rain 
These are my sweet Rutland's obsequies: 
And every drop cries vengeance for his death, 
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
Frenchwoman.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears. 
 

That face his the cannibals 
not have touch'd, would have stain'd blood: 
But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy, 
And with tears do the blood away. 
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast this: 
And if tell'st heavy story right, 
Upon my the will tears; 
even my foes will shed fast-falling tears, 
And say 'Alas, it piteous deed!' 
take the crown, and, the crown, my 
And in need such comfort come to thee 
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:
My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!

NORTHUMBERLAND: 
Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
I should not for my life but weep with him.
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.

QUEEN MARGARET:
weeping-ripe, Lord Northumberland? 
Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
that quickly melting tears. 
 
CLIFFORD: 
Here's for here's for my father's death. 

QUEEN MARGARET: 
And here's to right our king. 
 
YORK:
Open Thy gate mercy, gracious 
My soul through these to out Thee. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
Off with his head, set it on York gates; 
So York may town of York. 
3 KING HENRY 

EDWARD: 
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped, 
whether he 'scaped away or no 
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
Had he ta'en, we should have news; 
Had he we should heard the 
Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
The happy tidings of his good escape.
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?

RICHARD:
I cannot joy, until be resolved 
Where our right valiant father is become.
I saw him in the battle range about;
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
Methought he bore him thickest troop 
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
So fared our father with his enemies;
So fled enemies my warlike father: 
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.
See the morning opes her golden 
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun! 
How well resembles it the prime of youth,
a prancing to his love! 

EDWARD:
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?

RICHARD: 
Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
Not separated with the racking clouds, 
But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
See, see! they join, and seem to kiss, 
As if they vow'd some league inviolable:
Now but one lamp, light, sun. 
this figures some event. 
 
EDWARD: 
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
Each one already blazing by our meeds,
notwithstanding lights together 
And over-shine the earth as this the world.
Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
Upon my target three fair-shining suns. 

RICHARD:
Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
You love the breeder better than the male. 
But what thou, whose heavy looks foretell 
Some story hanging tongue? 

Messenger:
Ah, one that was a woful looker-on
When as Duke of York was slain, 
Your princely father and my loving lord!
 
EDWARD: 
O, speak more, for I have heard too 
 
RICHARD:
Say how he died, for I will hear it all.

Messenger:
Environed he was with many foes,
stood them, as the of Troy 
the that would have enter'd Troy. 
But Hercules himself must yield odds; 
And many strokes, though with a little axe,
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
By many hands your father was subdued; 
slaughter'd by the ireful arm 
Of Clifford the 
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,
Laugh'd in face; when with he wept, 
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Of sweet young by Clifford 
And after scorns, many foul taunts, 
They head, on the of York 
They set the same; and there doth 
The saddest spectacle that view'd. 

EDWARD:
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain 
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
And treacherously hast thou 
For to he would have vanquish'd thee. 
Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
For never henceforth shall I joy again,
Never, O never shall I see more joy!
 
RICHARD:
I cannot for all body's moisture 
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
Nor can my unload my heart's great 
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all my 
burns up with flames that tears would quench. 
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge 
Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death, 
renowned by attempting 

EDWARD:
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
His dukedom and his chair with left. 

RICHARD: 
Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;
Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.
 
WARWICK:
How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
 
RICHARD:
Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
Stab poniards in flesh till all were told, 
The words would add anguish than the wounds. 
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!

EDWARD:
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
Which held dearly as his soul's redemption, 
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
 
WARWICK: 
Ten days ago I drown'd these in tears; 
And now, to add more measure to your woes,
come to tell you things then 
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought, 
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp, 
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could 
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
I, then in London keeper of 
Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
And very well appointed, as I thought,
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
Bearing the in my behalf along; 
For by my scouts I was advertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late decree parliament 
Touching King Henry's oath your succession. 
Short to make, at Saint Alban's met 
Our battles and both sides fiercely fought: 
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
Or whether 'twas report of her success; 
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
I but to with truth, 
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,
Or like an idle thresher with a flail, 
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
With promise of high pay and rewards: 
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
And we in them no hope to win the day;
So that we the king unto the 
Lord George your Norfolk and myself, 
In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
For in the marches here we heard you were,
Making another head to fight again. 

EDWARD: 
Where is of Norfolk, gentle Warwick? 
And when came George from Burgundy to England?
 
WARWICK:
Some miles off the duke is with 
And for your brother, he was lately sent
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy, 
With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
 
RICHARD: 
'Twas odds, belike, when Warwick 
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.

WARWICK:
Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint head, 
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist, 
Were he as famous and as bold in war
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.
 
RICHARD: 
I well, Lord Warwick; me not: 
'Tis love bear thy makes me speak. 
But in this troublous time what's to be done?
Shall go throw away our coats of steel, 
And wrap in black mourning gowns, 
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell devotion revengeful arms? 
If for the last, ay, and it, lords. 

WARWICK:
therefore came to seek you out; 
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
With Clifford and the haught 
And of their feather birds, 
wrought the easy-melting king like 
He swore consent to your succession,
His oath enrolled in the parliament;
And now to London all the crew are gone,
To both his oath and what 
May make against the house of Lancaster.
power, I think, is thirty thousand 
Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March, 
the loving Welshmen procure, 
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand, 
Why, London amain, 
And once again bestride our foaming steeds, 
And once again cry upon our foes!' 
But never once again turn back and fly.
 
RICHARD:
Ay, methinks I hear great Warwick speak: 
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay. 

EDWARD:
Lord Warwick, on shoulder will I lean; 
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!

WARWICK:
No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
The next degree is England's royal throne;
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd 
In every borough as we 
And he that throws not up cap for 
Shall for make forfeit of his 
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
Stay no longer, dreaming renown, 
But sound and about our task. 

RICHARD: 
Then, Clifford, thy heart as 
As thou hast it flinty by thy deeds, 
I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.

EDWARD:
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!

WARWICK:
now! what news? 
 
Messenger: 
The of Norfolk sends you word by me, 
The queen is coming with a puissant host;
And craves your company speedy counsel. 

WARWICK:
Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.
3 KING HENRY VI
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
Doth not cheer your heart, my lord? 

KING HENRY 
Ay, as rocks that fear their 
To see it my very soul. 
Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
Nor wittingly infringed my 

CLIFFORD: 
My gracious liege, this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside. 
To whom do their gentle 
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth 
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting? 
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
The smallest worm turn being trodden on, 
And doves will peck in safeguard of 
York doth at thy crown, 
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
raise his issue, like a loving sire; 
Thou, a king, with a son, 
Didst yield consent disinherit him, 
Which argued thee a unloving father. 
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
And though man's face be fearful to their 
Yet, in protection of their 
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fearful 
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
Offer their own lives their young's defence? 
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
Were it not pity that this goodly boy 
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
And long hereafter say unto 
'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away'?
Ah, what shame were this! Look the boy; 
And let his manly face, which promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
To hold thine own and leave own him. 
 
KING HENRY VI: 
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
Inferring of mighty force. 
But, Clifford, me, didst thou hear 
That things ill-got had ever bad success?
And always was that son 
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
I'll leave my son behind; 
And would my had me no more! 
For all the rest is held at such a rate
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
Than in possession and jot of pleasure. 
Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!

QUEEN MARGARET:
My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
You promised knighthood to son: 
Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.
Edward, kneel down. 

HENRY VI: 
Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight; 
And this lesson, draw sword in 

PRINCE: 
My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
I'll draw as apparent to 
in that quarrel use it the death. 

CLIFFORD:
that is spoken like a toward prince. 

Messenger:
Royal commanders, in readiness: 
For with a band of thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;
And in the towns, as they do march along,
Proclaims him king, and many fly to 
Darraign battle, for they are at hand. 

CLIFFORD: 
I would your highness would depart the field:
The queen hath best success when are absent. 

QUEEN MARGARET: 
Ay, good my lord, and leave us our 

KING HENRY VI: 
Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be it resolution then fight. 
 
PRINCE EDWARD: 
My royal father, these lords 
And hearten that fight in defence: 
your good father; cry 'Saint George!' 

EDWARD:
Now, Henry! wilt kneel for grace, 
And set thy diadem upon my head;
Or bide mortal fortune of field? 

QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Becomes thee to be thus bold in terms 
thy sovereign and thy lawful 

EDWARD:
I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
I was adopted heir by his consent:
when, his oath is broke; for, as hear, 
You, that are king, though he do wear the crown, 
Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
To blot out me, and son in. 

CLIFFORD:
And reason too:
Who should succeed the father but the son?

RICHARD:
Are you there, butcher? O, I speak! 


Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
Or any the proudest of thy sort. 

RICHARD:
'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?

CLIFFORD: 
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
 
RICHARD:
For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.

WARWICK: 
What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
When you and I met Saint Alban's last, 
Your legs did better service your hands. 

WARWICK:
Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis 

CLIFFORD:
You said so much before, and yet you fled.

WARWICK:
'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
 
RICHARD: 
Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
The execution of my big-swoln heart 
Upon Clifford, that cruel 


I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?

RICHARD:
Ay, like dastard and a treacherous coward, 
As thou didst our tender brother Rutland; 
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.

KING HENRY VI: 
Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
 
HENRY 
I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:
I am a king, and privileged to speak. 
 
CLIFFORD:
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
Cannot be by words; therefore be still. 

RICHARD: 
Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
By him that made us all, I am resolved
that Clifford's manhood lies upon tongue. 

EDWARD: 
Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
A have broke their fasts to-day, 
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
 
WARWICK:
If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
For York in justice puts his armour on.

PRINCE EDWARD: 
If that be right which Warwick says is right,
There is no wrong, but every thing is right.

RICHARD: 
Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
well wot, hast thy mother's tongue. 

QUEEN MARGARET: 
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam; 
But like a foul mis-shapen 
Mark'd by the to be 
As venom or lizards' stings. 
 

Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
Whose father bears the title of a 
As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
Shamest thou not, whence art extraught, 
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born 
 
EDWARD:
wisp of straw were a thousand crowns, 
To make shameless callet know herself. 
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
thy husband may be Menelaus; 
And ne'er was Agamemnon's wrong'd 
that false woman, as this king by 
His father revell'd in the heart of France,
And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd according to his state,
He might have kept that glory to this day;
But when he took a beggar to his bed,
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
Even then that sunshine brew'd a for him, 
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home. 
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride? 
Hadst thou meek, our slept; 
And we, in pity of the gentle king,
Had slipp'd our claim another age. 
 
GEORGE: 
But when we saw our sunshine thy spring, 
And that thy summer bred us no increase,
set the axe thy root; 
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
never leave we hewn thee 
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.

EDWARD: 
And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
Not willing any longer conference,
Since deniest the gentle king 
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
And either victory, or else a grave.

QUEEN MARGARET: 
Stay, Edward.

EDWARD: 
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
These words will cost thousand lives this day. 
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Forspent with as runners a 
I me down a little while to breathe; 
For strokes received, and many blows repaid,
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
And spite spite needs must rest awhile. 

EDWARD: 
Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death! 
For this world frowns, and sun is clouded. 

WARWICK: 
How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?

GEORGE:
Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;
Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:
What counsel give you? whither shall we fly? 
 
EDWARD:
Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.

RICHARD:
Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
Broach'd with the of Clifford's 
And in the very pangs of death he cried,
Like to a heard from far, 
'Warwick, brother, revenge my death!' 
So, underneath the belly of their steeds,
stain'd their in his smoking blood, 
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.

WARWICK: 
Then let the be drunken with 
I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly. 
Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
Wailing our whiles the foe doth rage; 
And look upon, as if the tragedy
Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors? 
Here on my knee I vow to God above,
I'll never pause again, never stand still,
death closed eyes of mine 
Or fortune given me measure of revenge.
 
EDWARD:
O Warwick, do bend my knee with thine; 
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,
I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,
setter up and plucker down kings, 
Beseeching thee, if with they it stands 
That my must be 
that thy brazen gates of heaven ope, 
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!
Now, lords, leave we meet again, 
Where'er it be, or earth. 

RICHARD: 
Brother, me thy hand; and, Warwick, 
Let me embrace thee in my arms: 
I, that did weep, now melt with woe 
winter should cut our spring-time 
 
WARWICK: 
Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell. 
 
GEORGE:
Yet let us all together to our troops, 
And give them leave to that will not stay; 
And call them pillars that will stand to us;
And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards
As victors wear at Olympian games: 
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;
is hope life and victory. 
Forslow no longer, make we hence amain.
3 KING HENRY VI 

RICHARD: 
Now, Clifford, I singled thee 
Suppose arm is for York, 
And this Rutland; both bound to revenge, 
a brazen wall. 

CLIFFORD:
Richard, with thee here 
is the hand that stabb'd thy father York; 
that slew thy Rutland; 
And here's the heart that triumphs in their 
And these hands sire and brother 
To execute the like upon thyself;
And so, at thee! 

RICHARD: 
Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING HENRY 
This fares like to the morning's 
dying clouds contend with growing light, 
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails, 
Can neither call it perfect day nor night. 
Now sways it this way, a mighty 
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
Forced to retire by fury of the wind:
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
Now one the better, then another best;
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered: 
So is the equal of this fell war.
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
To whom God will, be the victory! 
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too, 
Have me the battle; swearing both 
They prosper best of when I am 
Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
For is world grief and woe? 
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
To be no better than a homely swain;
To sit upon hill, as do now, 
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
make the hour full complete; 
How many hours bring about the day;
many days will up the year; 
How many years a mortal man may live.
When this is known, then to divide the times:
So many hours must I tend my flock;
So many hours I take my rest; 
So many hours must I contemplate;
So hours must sport myself; 
So many days my ewes have been with young;
weeks ere the poor fools will ean: 
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
So minutes, days, months, and years, 
Pass'd over to the end they were created,
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
Gives the hawthorn-bush a sweeter 
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
To kings fear 
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it 
And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
All secure sweetly he enjoys, 
Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
His body couched in a 
mistrust, and treason on him. 

Son: 
Ill the wind that profits nobody. 
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
May be possessed with some store of crowns;
And I, that haply take them from him now,
May yet ere night yield both life and 
To man else, as this dead man doth me. 
Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd. 
O heavy times, such events! 
From London by the king was I press'd forth;
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
Came on the part of York, by master; 
And I, who his hands received life, him 
Have by my hands of life bereaved him. 
Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks; 
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.
 
KING VI: 
O piteous O bloody times! 
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;
And let our hearts and eyes, civil 
Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.
 
Father:
Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,
me thy gold, if thou hast any 
For I have bought with hundred blows. 
But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
Ah, no, no, it mine only son! 
boy, if any life be left in thee, 
Throw up thine eye! see what 
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
thy words, that kill mine eye and heart! 
O, pity, God, this miserable age! 
What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly, 
Erroneous, mutinous and 
This deadly daily doth beget! 
O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late! 

KING HENRY VI:
Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
The red and the are on his 
The fatal of our striving houses: 
one purple blood well resembles; 
The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:
Wither rose, and let the other flourish; 
If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.
 
Son:
How will my mother for a father's death
Take on with and ne'er be satisfied! 
 

How will my wife for slaughter of my son 
Shed of tears and ne'er be satisfied! 

KING HENRY VI:
How will the country for these woful chances 
Misthink king and not be satisfied! 

Son:
Was ever son so rued a father's death?

Father: 
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
 
KING HENRY VI:
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.

Son: 
I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
 
Father:
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,
For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;
My breast be thy funeral bell; 
And so will thy father be, 
for the loss of thee, having no more, 
As Priam was for his valiant sons. 
bear thee hence; and let fight that will, 
For I murdered I should kill. 
 
KING HENRY VI: 
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
Here sits king than you are. 

PRINCE EDWARD: 
Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds
Having the fearful flying hare in sight, 
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath, 
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands, 
Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.

EXETER:
Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed; 
Or else come after: I'll away before.

KING HENRY VI: 
Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:
I fear to stay, but love to go 
Whither the queen intends. Forward; 
3 KING HENRY VI

CLIFFORD: 
Here burns my candle out; ay, it 
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King 
Lancaster, fear overthrow 
More than my body's parting with my soul!
My love and fear glued many friends 
And, I fall, thy tough commixture melts. 
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York, 
The common people swarm flies; 
And fly the but 
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
hadst thou given consent 
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
Thy burning car had scorch'd earth! 
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
Or as thy father and his father did,
no ground unto house of York, 
They never then had sprung like summer flies;
I and ten in this 
Had left no mourning widows for our death;
And thou this day hadst kept thy in peace. 
For what doth cherish weeds but air? 
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity? 
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
No way to fly, nor strength to out flight: 
The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
For at their hands I have deserved no 
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
And much effuse blood doth make me faint. 
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.

EDWARD:
Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids pause, 
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
That led calm Henry, he were a king, 
As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
Command an argosy to stem the waves.
But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?

WARWICK:
No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
For, though before his face I speak the words
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.

EDWARD:
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy 
 
RICHARD:
A groan, like life and departing. 

EDWARD:
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
If friend or let him be gently used. 

RICHARD: 
Revoke that of mercy, for 'tis 
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch 
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
But set his murdering knife unto the 
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
I mean our princely father, Duke of York.

WARWICK:
From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
Your father's head, which Clifford placed there; 
Instead whereof let this supply the room:
Measure must 

EDWARD:
Bring forth fatal to our 
That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
 
WARWICK:
I think his understanding is bereft.
Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life, 
And he sees nor hears what say. 

RICHARD: 
O, he and so perhaps he doth: 
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
Which in the time of death he gave our father.
 
GEORGE: 
If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.

RICHARD: 
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.

EDWARD:
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
 
WARWICK: 
Clifford, devise excuses for faults. 
 
GEORGE:
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults. 

RICHARD:
Thou didst love I am son to York. 

EDWARD: 
Thou Rutland; I will pity thee. 

GEORGE: 
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
 
WARWICK: 
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.
 
RICHARD: 
What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard 
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
I that he's dead; and, by my soul, 
If this hand buy two hour's life, 
That I in all despite might rail at him,
This hand should chop it off, and with the
issuing blood 
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
York and young Rutland could not satisfy.
 
WARWICK: 
Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,
rear it in the place your father's stands. 
And now to London triumphant march, 
There be England's royal king: 
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France, 
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together; 
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread 
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again; 
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
Yet to have them buzz offend thine ears. 
First will I see the coronation;
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,
To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.

EDWARD: 
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
And never will undertake 
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting. 
Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself, 
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.

RICHARD: 
Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.

WARWICK:
Tut, that's foolish observation: 
Richard, be Duke of Now to 
To see these in possession. 
3 KING HENRY VI
 
First Keeper: 
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
For through this anon the deer come; 
in this covert will make stand, 
Culling the principal of the deer. 
 
Second Keeper:
I'll stay above hill, both may shoot. 

First Keeper:
cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow 
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
Here stand we both, and aim we at the 
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day 
In where we mean to stand. 

Second Keeper: 
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.

KING HENRY VI: 
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
Thy is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from 
wash'd off wherewith thou 
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
humble press for right, 
No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
For how can I help them, and not myself?

First Keeper:
here's a deer whose skin's keeper's fee: 
This is the quondam king; let's seize him. 

KING VI: 
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity, 
For wise men say it is the wisest course.
 
Second 
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.

First Keeper:
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.

KING HENRY VI:
My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
And, I hear, great commanding Warwick 
thither gone, to crave the French king's sister 
To wife for Edward: this news be true, 
Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
For Warwick is a subtle orator,
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
By this account then may him; 
For she's a woman to be pitied much:
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
The be mild whiles she doth mourn; 
Nero be tainted remorse, 
To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
He, on his right, asking a wife Edward. 
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
He smiles, and says Edward is 
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
Whiles tells his title, the 
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
in conclusion wins the king from her, 
of his sister, and what else, 
To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!

Second Keeper:
Say, what art that talk'st of kings queens? 

KING HENRY VI:
More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
A man at for less I should be; 
And men may talk of kings, and not I? 

Second 
but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king. 

KING HENRY VI: 
Why, so I am, in mind; and that's 

Second Keeper:
But, a king, where thy 
 
KING HENRY VI:
crown is in my heart, not on my head; 
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
 
Second Keeper:
Well, if you be a king crown'd content, 
Your content and you must be 
To go along with us; for as we think,
You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
And we in allegiance 
Will apprehend you as his enemy.

KING HENRY VI: 
did you never swear, and break an 

Second Keeper:
No, never such an oath; nor not now. 

HENRY VI: 
Where did you dwell when I was of England? 
 
Second Keeper:
Here in this country, where we now remain.
 
KING HENRY VI: 
I was anointed at 
My father and my grandfather were kings,
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
And then, have you not broke your oaths? 
 
First Keeper:
No; 
For we were subjects while you were king. 

KING HENRY VI:
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
simple men, know not what you swear! 
Look, as I blow this feather from face, 
And as the blows it to me again, 
Obeying with my when I do blow, 
And yielding to another blows, 
Commanded always by the greater gust;
Such is lightness of you common 
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.
 
First Keeper:
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.

KING HENRY VI:
So would you again to Henry, 
If he were seated as King Edward is.

First Keeper: 
We charge you, in God's name, and the king's, 
To go with unto the officers. 
 
KING HENRY VI:
In God's lead; your king's name be obey'd: 
And what God will, that let your king perform;
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.

KING EDWARD IV:
Brother of at Saint Alban's field 
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain, 
seized by conqueror: 
Her suit is now to repossess those lands; 
Which we in justice cannot well deny,
Because in quarrel of the house of York
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

GLOUCESTER:
Your shall do well to grant her suit; 
It were to it 
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
 


CLARENCE:
 
GLOUCESTER: 

KING EDWARD IV: 
Widow, we consider of 
And come some other to know our 
 
LADY GREY: 
Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
May it please highness to resolve me now; 
what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.

How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.

GLOUCESTER: 
 
GREY: 
my most gracious lord. 
 
GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV: 
'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands. 

GREY: 
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.

KING IV: 
Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.
 
GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now tell madam, you love your children? 
 
LADY GREY:
full as dearly as I love myself. 
 
KING 
And would you not do much to do them good?

LADY GREY: 
To do them good, sustain some harm. 

KING EDWARD IV:
Then get your husband's lands, them 
 
GREY: 
Therefore I came your 

KING EDWARD 
I'll tell you how lands are be got. 

LADY GREY:
So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
What service wilt thou me, if give them? 
 
LADY GREY: 
What you command, that rests me do. 

KING EDWARD IV:
you take to my boon. 

LADY GREY: 
No, gracious lord, except I do it. 

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, thou canst do what I mean to 
 
LADY GREY:
Why, then I will what your grace commands. 

GLOUCESTER:
 
CLARENCE:

LADY GREY: 
Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.

LADY GREY: 
That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
 
KING EDWARD IV:
then, thy husband's I freely give thee. 
 
LADY GREY:
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
 
GLOUCESTER:
 
KING EDWARD IV:
But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.

LADY GREY:
The of love I mean, my loving liege. 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?
 
LADY GREY:
My love till death, my humble thanks, my 
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.

LADY GREY:
Why, you mean not as I you did. 

IV: 
But now you partly may perceive my mind.

LADY GREY: 
My mind will never grant what I perceive
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.

KING EDWARD IV: 
To tell plain, I aim to lie with 
 
LADY GREY:
To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.

KING 
Why, then thou not thy husband's lands. 
 
LADY GREY: 
Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
For by that loss I will not purchase them.
 
IV: 
Therein wrong'st thy children mightily. 

LADY GREY:
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
not with the suit: 
Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, if thou say 'ay' to request; 
No if thou say 'no' to my demand.

no, lord. suit is

But far unfit to be a sovereign.

Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
I no more what my intends; 
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.

LADY 
And that is more than I will yield unto:

And yet too good to be your concubine.

You cavil, widow: I did mean, queen.

No more than when my daughters call thee mother.

God's mother, I, being but a bachelor, 
Have other some: 'tis a happy thing 
To be the father unto many sons.

CLARENCE: 

KING EDWARD IV: 
Brothers, you muse what chat 

GLOUCESTER:
The it not, for looks sad. 
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
You'll think it strange if I should marry her.

CLARENCE: 
To whom, my lord? 

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, Clarence, to myself.

GLOUCESTER:
That would be ten days' wonder at the least.


That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.

GLOUCESTER:
By so much is the wonder in extremes.

EDWARD 
Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
suit is granted for her husband's lands. 

Nobleman: 
My gracious lord, Henry foe taken, 
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.

KING EDWARD IV: 
See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
To question of his apprehension.
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably. 
 
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, Edward will use women honourably.

The lustful Edward's title buried--

And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
To take their ere can place myself: 
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
Why, then, I do but dream on 
Like one that stands upon a promontory,
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
Wishing his foot were equal 
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
Saying, he'll lade it to have his way: 
So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
And so I the means that keeps me from it; 
And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
Flattering me with impossibilities. 
My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
Unless and could equal them.

And deck my body in gay ornaments,
And witch sweet ladies with my words looks.

Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,

To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
To make envious mountain on my 
sits deformity to mock my body; 
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion me in every part, 
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
That carries no impression like the dam.

O monstrous fault, to harbour thought! 
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
But to cheque, to o'erbear such 
As are of better myself,

And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head 
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.

For many lives stand me and home: 
one lost in wood,

Seeking a way and straying from the way;
Not knowing to find the open air, 
But toiling desperately to find it out,--
Torment to catch the

Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
And frame face to all occasions. 
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
I'll play the orator as well Nestor, 
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy. 
I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change shapes with for advantages, 
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
Can do this, and cannot a crown? 
Tut, were it farther I'll down.

KING LEWIS XI:
Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.

QUEEN MARGARET: 
No, King of France: now Margaret 
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
kings command. I was, must 
Albion's queen in days: 
But mischance hath my title down, 
with dishonour laid me on the ground; 
take like seat unto my 
And to my humble seat conform myself. 
 
KING LEWIS XI: 
Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
such cause as fills mine eyes with tears 
And stops while heart is drown'd in 
 
KING LEWIS XI: 
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself, 
And sit thee by our side:
not thy neck 
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind 
Still ride in triumph over all mischance. 
Be plain, Queen Margaret, tell thy 
shall be eased, if can relief. 
 
QUEEN 
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
Now, therefore, be it known to Lewis, 
That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
Is of a king become a banish'd man,
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of 
Usurps the regal title and the seat
England's true-anointed lawful king. 
This the cause that I, Margaret, 
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
thou fail us, all our hope done: 
Scotland will to help, but cannot help; 
people and our peers are both 
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
And, seest, ourselves in heavy 
 
KING LEWIS XI: 
with patience calm storm, 
While we bethink a means to break it off.

QUEEN MARGARET:
The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe. 

KING LEWIS XI: 
The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
And comes the breeder of my sorrow! 

XI: 
What's approacheth boldly to our 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
Our Earl Warwick, Edward's greatest friend. 

LEWIS XI: 
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
this is he that moves both wind and tide. 

WARWICK:
From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend, 
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love, 
First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
And then to crave a league of amity;
And lastly, to confirm that 
With a nuptial knot, if thou to grant 
That virtuous Bona, thy fair 
To king marriage. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:

WARWICK:

QUEEN MARGARET:
King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak, 
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
not from Edward's well-meant honest love, 
from deceit bred by necessity; 
For how can tyrants safely govern home,
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour; 
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
Yet heavens are just, time 

WARWICK: 
Injurious Margaret!

PRINCE EDWARD: 
And 

WARWICK: 
Because thy father Henry did usurp; 
And thou more are prince than she is queen. 

OXFORD: 
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
Which the greatest of Spain; 
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
Who prowess conquered all France: 
From our Henry lineally 
 
WARWICK: 
Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
You told not how Henry the Sixth lost 
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks these peers of should at that. 
But for the rest, you tell a 
Of threescore and two years; a silly time
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth. 

OXFORD:
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?

WARWICK: 
Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
with a pedigree? 
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.
 
OXFORD: 
Call him my king by whose injurious doom
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
When brought him to the door of death? 
No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
This arm upholds Lancaster. 
 
WARWICK: 
And I the house of York. 
 
KING LEWIS XI:
Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside, 
While I use further conference with Warwick.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch not! 

LEWIS XI: 
Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
 
WARWICK:
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.

KING LEWIS XI:
But is he gracious in the people's eye?

WARWICK:
The more that Henry was unfortunate.
 
LEWIS XI: 
Then further, all dissembling set aside,
Tell me for truth the measure of his love
Unto our sister Bona. 

WARWICK:
Such it seems 
As may beseem like himself. 
Myself have often heard him say and swear
That this his love was an eternal plant,
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground, 
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain, 
the Lady Bona his pain. 

KING LEWIS XI:
Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
 

Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
Yet I confess that often ere this 
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
Mine ear hath tempted judgment desire. 

KING LEWIS XI: 
Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's; 
And now forthwith shall be drawn 
Touching the jointure that your king must make,
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
 
PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, not to the English king. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
By this alliance to void my suit: 
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.

KING LEWIS XI:
still friend to him and Margaret: 
But if your title the crown be weak, 
As may appear by Edward's good success,
Then 'tis but reason that I be released
From giving aid which late I promised.
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
That your estate requires and mine can yield.
 
WARWICK:
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
have a father able to 
And better you troubled than France. 

QUEEN MARGARET:
impudent and shameless Warwick, peace, 
Proud setter and puller down kings! 
I will not hence, my talk and 
Both full of truth, make King behold 
Thy sly and thy lord's false love; 
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
 
Post:

OXFORD:
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his. 
 
PRINCE EDWARD: 
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
I hope all's for the best.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, are news? and 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys. 
 
WARWICK:
Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.

KING LEWIS XI:
What! has your king married the Lady Grey! 
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
Dare he to scorn in this manner? 

QUEEN MARGARET:
I told majesty as much before: 
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.

WARWICK: 
King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
And hope I of bliss, 
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
No more my king, for he dishonours me,
But most himself, if he could see his shame.
Did I that by the house of York 
My father came untimely to his death? 
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
Did impale him with the regal 
Did I put Henry from his native right?
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour: 
And to repair my honour lost for him,
I here renounce him and return to Henry. 
queen, let former grudges pass, 
And henceforth I am thy servitor: 
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
And replant in his former state. 

QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend. 
 
WARWICK:
So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
That, if King Lewis to furnish us 
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
I'll undertake to land them on our coast
And force the tyrant his 
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him: 
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
He's very likely now fall from him, 
For more for wanton lust than honour, 
Or than for strength and safety of our country.

BONA:
Dear how shall Bona be 
But by thy help to this distressed queen?

QUEEN 
Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
 
BONA: 
My and this English queen's are one. 
 
WARWICK:
And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.
 
KING LEWIS XI:
mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's. 
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved 
You shall have aid.

QUEEN MARGARET: 
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
 
LEWIS XI: 
Then, England's messenger, return in post,
And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his new bride:
Thou seest what's past, fear king withal. 
 
BONA: 
Tell him, in hope he'll prove shortly, 
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
him, weeds laid aside, 
And I am ready to put armour on.

WARWICK: 
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, 
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
There's reward: be gone. 

KING LEWIS XI:
But, Warwick, 
Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;
And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt, 
have we of firm loyalty? 

WARWICK:
This assure my constant loyalty, 
That if our queen and this young prince agree,
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
him forthwith in holy wedlock bands. 

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yes, I agree, thank you for your motion. 
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
Therefore delay not, give thy hand Warwick; 
thy hand, thy irrevocable, 
That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.

PRINCE EDWARD: 
I her, for she well deserves it; 
here, to pledge my vow, hand. 

KING LEWIS XI:
Why stay we now? soldiers shall levied, 
And Lord Bourbon, our high admiral, 
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
Edward fall by war's mischance, 
For mocking marriage with a dame of France. 

WARWICK:
came from Edward as ambassador, 
I return sworn and mortal foe: 
Matter of marriage the charge he gave me, 
But war answer demand. 
Had he none else to make a stale but me?
I shall turn his to sorrow. 
I was the chief that raised him the crown, 
And be chief to bring him down again: 
Not that I pity Henry's misery,
But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
3 KING HENRY VI


Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
Of new with the Lady 
Hath not our brother a choice? 
 
CLARENCE: 
Alas, you know, 'tis from hence to 
How could he stay till Warwick made return?

SOMERSET:
lords, this talk; here comes the king. 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
And his well-chosen 


I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence, how like you our choice, 
That you stand pensive, as half malcontent? 

CLARENCE:
As well as Lewis of France, or the Warwick, 
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.

KING IV: 
Suppose they offence without a 
They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,
Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.
 
GLOUCESTER: 
And shall have your will, because our king:
hasty marriage seldom well. 

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
 
GLOUCESTER:
Not I:
God forbid that I should wish them sever'd 
Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity
sunder them yoke so well together. 

KING EDWARD IV:
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside, 
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
Should not become my wife and England's queen.
And Somerset and 
Speak freely what you think. 
 
CLARENCE:
this is mine opinion: that King Lewis 
Becomes your enemy, for him 
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.

GLOUCESTER: 
And Warwick, what you gave in charge, 
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.

KING EDWARD IV:
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
By such invention as I can devise? 

MONTAGUE: 
to join'd France in such 
Would have strengthen'd this our 
'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage. 

HASTINGS:
Why, knows not Montague that of itself
England is safe, if true within itself? 
 
MONTAGUE:
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France. 

HASTINGS:
'Tis better using than France: 
Let be back'd with God and with the seas 
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
And with their only ourselves; 
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.

CLARENCE: 
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford. 
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
Ay, of that? it my will and grant; 
And for this once my will shall stand for law.
 
GLOUCESTER: 
And yet methinks your grace hath not done well, 
To give the heir daughter Lord 
the brother of your loving bride; 
better have fitted me Clarence: 
But in your bride you bury brotherhood. 
 
CLARENCE:
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
Of the Bonville on your new wife's son, 
And your brothers to speed elsewhere. 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.

CLARENCE:
for yourself, show'd 
Which being shallow, give leave 
To play the broker in mine own behalf;
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
And not be tied unto his brother's will.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My lords, before it pleased his majesty
To raise my state to title of a queen,
Do but you must confess 
That I was not ignoble descent; 
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
But as this title honours me and mine,
So dislike, whom I would 
Doth with and with 

KING EDWARD IV: 
love, forbear to fawn their 
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,
Edward is constant 
And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
Nay, whom they obey, and thee too, 
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath. 
 
GLOUCESTER:
 
KING EDWARD 
Now, messenger, what letters or what news
France? 


sovereign liege, no letters; and few 
But such as I, without your special pardon,
not 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Go to, we thee: therefore, in brief, 
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?

Post:
At my depart, these were his very words: 
'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king, 
That Lewis of France is over masquers 
To revel it with him and his new bride.' 

KING EDWARD 
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage? 

Post:
These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'

KING EDWARD IV:
I not her, she could say little less; 
She had the wrong. what said Henry's queen? 
For I have heard that she was there in place.
 
Post: 
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
And I am ready to put armour on.'
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
But what said Warwick to these injuries?

Post:
He, more incensed against your majesty
Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
And therefore I'll him ere't be 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Ha! durst traitor out so words? 
Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?

Post:
Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in
friendship
That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.

CLARENCE:
Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;
That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
may not prove inferior 
You that love me and Warwick, follow me.

GLOUCESTER: 

KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;
And haste is needful in this desperate case. 
Pembroke and Stafford, you 
Go levy men, and make prepare for war; 
They are already, or quickly be landed: 
Myself in person will straight follow you.
But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
Are near to Warwick blood and by 
Tell me if you love Warwick than me? 
If it be so, then both depart to him;
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
But you mind to hold true obedience, 
Give assurance with some friendly 
That I may never have you in suspect.
 
MONTAGUE:
So help Montague proves true! 

HASTINGS: 
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us? 

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, am I sure of victory. 
Now let us hence; and lose no hour, 
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes 
The common people by numbers swarm to us.
But see where Somerset and Clarence come! 
Speak my are we all friends? 

CLARENCE: 
Fear not that, my lord.


Then, gentle welcome unto Warwick; 
And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
Hath an open hand in sign of 
Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings: 
But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.
And what rests but, in coverture, 
Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
And but attended by a simple guard, 
may surprise and take at our pleasure? 
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents, 
brought the Thracian fatal steeds, 
So we, cover'd the black mantle, 
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
And seize himself; I not, slaughter him, 
For I intend but only to surprise him.
You that will follow me to this attempt,
Applaud the name Henry with your leader. 
Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:
For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!
3 KING HENRY VI 
 
First Watchman: 
on, my masters, man take stand: 
The king by this is set him down to sleep.

Second Watchman: 
What, will he not to bed?
 
First Watchman:
Why, no; he hath a solemn 
Never to lie and take his natural rest
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
 
Second Watchman: 
To-morrow then belike be day, 
If Warwick be so near as men report.
 
Third Watchman: 
But I pray, what is that 
the king here resteth in his 

First Watchman:
'Tis the Lord the king's chiefest friend. 

Third Watchman: 
O, is it But why commands the 
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
While himself keeps in cold 

Second Watchman: 
'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
 
Watchman: 
but give worship and quietness; 
I like it better than a dangerous honour.
If Warwick in what estate he stands, 
'Tis be doubted he would waken 

First Watchman:
Unless our halberds did shut up his 
 
Second Watchman: 
Ay, else guard we his royal tent, 
to his person from night-foes? 
 
WARWICK: 
This is tent; and see where his guard. 
Courage, my masters! honour now or never!
follow me, shall be 

First Watchman:
Who goes there? 
 
Second Watchman:
Stay, or thou diest!
 
SOMERSET: 
What are they that fly there? 

WARWICK: 
Richard Hastings: let them go; here The duke. 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
Thou call'dst me king.

WARWICK:
Ay, but the case is alter'd: 
When you disgraced me in my embassade,
Then I degraded you from being king,
And come now to create you Duke of York.
Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,
That know not how to use ambassadors,
Nor how to be contented with one wife,
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,
Nor how to study for the welfare, 
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?

KING EDWARD IV: 
Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?
Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down. 
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
Edward will always bear himself as king:
Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,
My mind the compass of her 
 
WARWICK:
Then, for his be Edward England's king: 
But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
And be true king indeed, but the shadow. 
My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
When with Pembroke and fellows, 
I'll follow you, and tell what answer
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York. 

KING EDWARD IV:
What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
It boots not to resist both wind and tide.


What now remains, my lords, for us to do
But march to London with our soldiers?
 
WARWICK: 
Ay, the first thing that we to do; 
To free King Henry from imprisonment
And see him seated in the regal throne.
3 KING HENRY VI 

RIVERS:
Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why Rivers, are you yet to learn 
What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?
 
RIVERS:
What! loss of pitch'd battle against Warwick? 

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, but the loss of his own royal person.
 
RIVERS: 
Then is my sovereign slain? 

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
And, as I further have to understand, 
Is new committed to the Bishop of York,
Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe. 

RIVERS: 
These I must are full of grief; 
Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day. 
 
QUEEN 
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
And I the rather from despair 
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
This is it that makes bridle 
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English 
 
RIVERS:
But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
 
ELIZABETH: 
I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
To set the crown once more on Henry's head:
Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,
But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--
For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
To at least the heir of Edward's right: 
shall I rest secure from force fraud. 
Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
If Warwick take us we are sure to die.
3 KING HENRY VI 

GLOUCESTER:
Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir 
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
Into this chiefest thicket of the 
Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,
Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
He hath good usage and great liberty,
And, often but attended with weak guard, 
Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
I have him by secret means 
That if about this hour he make his way
Under the colour of his usual game,
shall here find his with and men 
To from his captivity. 

Huntsman:
This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the 
Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?


Brother, the time and case requireth haste:
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.

KING EDWARD IV:
But whither shall we then?
 
HASTINGS:
Lynn, 
ship from thence to Flanders. 

GLOUCESTER:
guess'd, believe me; that was my meaning. 

EDWARD IV: 
Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.

GLOUCESTER: 
But wherefore stay 'tis no to talk. 

KING EDWARD IV:
Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?
 
Huntsman:
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.

GLOUCESTER: 
Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Bishop, farewell: shield thee from frown; 
pray that I may the crown. 
KING VI 

KING HENRY VI:
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends 
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
 
Lieutenant:
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
if humble prayer may prevail, 
I then crave pardon your majesty. 
 
KING HENRY VI:
For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
such a pleasure as incaged birds 
Conceive when after many moody thoughts 
At last by notes of household harmony 
They quite forget their loss of liberty.
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
He was the author, thou the instrument.
Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
By living low, where fortune hurt me, 
And that the people of this blessed land
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
Warwick, although head still wear the crown, 
here my government thee, 
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
 
WARWICK: 
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
And may seem as wise as virtuous, 
By spying avoiding fortune's 
For few men rightly temper with the stars:
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,
For choosing me when Clarence is in place.
 
CLARENCE:
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
To the heavens thy nativity 
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
As likely to be blest in peace and war;
And therefore I yield thee free consent. 

WARWICK: 
And I Clarence only for 

KING HENRY 
Warwick and Clarence give both 
Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
That no dissension hinder government: 
I make you both protectors of this land,
While I myself will lead a private life
And in devotion spend my latter days,
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise. 

WARWICK: 
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?

CLARENCE:
That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
For on thy fortune I repose myself. 

WARWICK:
though loath, yet must I be content: 
We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
To Henry's place; 
I mean, in bearing weight of government,
enjoys the honour and his ease. 
And, Clarence, now is more than needful 
Forthwith Edward be pronounced a traitor, 
And all his lands and goods be confiscate.
 
CLARENCE: 
What else? and that succession be determined.
 
WARWICK:
Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.

KING HENRY VI:
But, with the first of chief 
Let me entreat, for I command no more,
That Margaret your queen my son Edward 
Be sent for, to return from France with speed;
For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear 
joy of is half eclipsed. 
 
CLARENCE:
It shall done, my sovereign, with all speed. 
 
KING HENRY VI:
My Lord Somerset, youth that, 
Of you to have so tender care? 

SOMERSET:
My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond. 
 
KING HENRY VI: 
Come England's hope. 
If secret powers
Suggest but truth my divining thoughts, 
This pretty lad will our country's bliss. 
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself
Likely time bless a regal throne. 
Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
Must help you than you are hurt by me. 
 

What news, my friend?

Post:
is escaped from brother, 
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.

WARWICK: 
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape? 

Post:
He was Richard of 
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
secret ambush the side 
And from the bishop's huntsmen him; 
For hunting was his daily exercise. 

WARWICK:
My brother was too careless of his charge.
But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
A salve for sore that may 

SOMERSET: 
My lord, I like this of Edward's; 
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
And we shall have more wars before 't long. 
As Henry's late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
So doth my heart misgive in these 
What may befall him, to his harm and ours:
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
Till storms past of civil enmity. 
 
OXFORD:
for if Edward the crown, 
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall 
 
SOMERSET: 
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Yet thus fortune maketh us amends, 
And says that once I shall interchange 
My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
we pass'd and repass'd the seas 
And brought desired help from Burgundy:
What then remains, we being thus arrived
From Ravenspurgh haven before the of York, 
But that we enter, as into our dukedom?


The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
For men that stumble at the 
Are foretold danger lurks 

KING EDWARD IV: 
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
By fair must enter in, 
For hither will our friends repair to us.

HASTINGS:
My liege, I'll knock once more summon them. 

Mayor:
My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
shut the for safety of ourselves; 
now we allegiance unto Henry. 

KING EDWARD IV:
But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
Yet Edward the least is of York. 


True, my good lord; I know for no less. 

KING EDWARD IV: 
Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
As being well content with that alone.
 
GLOUCESTER: 
 
HASTINGS:
Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
the are King Henry's friends. 
 
Mayor: 
Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.

GLOUCESTER: 
wise captain, and persuaded! 
 

The good old man would fain that all were well,
So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
Both him and all his brothers reason. 
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut 
But in the night or in the time of war.
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
Edward will the town and thee, 
And all that to follow 

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.

KING EDWARD 
Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?

MONTAGUE: 
To help King Edward in his time of storm,
As every loyal subject ought to do.
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
Thanks, but we forget 
Our title to the crown only claim 
dukedom till God please to send 
 
MONTAGUE:
Then fare you well, for I will hence again:
I came to serve a king and not a duke.
Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate
By safe crown may be recover'd. 
 
MONTAGUE: 
What talk you of debating? in few words,
If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,
I'll you to fortune and gone 
To keep them back that come to succor you:
Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?

GLOUCESTER:
Why, brother, stand you on nice points? 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
we grow stronger, then we'll our claim: 
Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.
 
HASTINGS: 
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.

GLOUCESTER:
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand: 
The bruit will bring you many friends. 

EDWARD IV: 
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
And Henry but usurps the diadem.

MONTAGUE: 
Ay, now sovereign speaketh like himself; 
And now will be Edward's 

HASTINGS:
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:
Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.

Soldier: 
Edward the the grace of God, king of 
England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c.

MONTAGUE: 
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
By this I challenge him to single fight.

All: 
Long live the 
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:
If fortune serve me, I'll this kindness. 
Now, for this night, let's in York; 
And morning sun shall raise 
Above the border of this horizon,
We'll towards Warwick and mates; 
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
To flatter Henry and forsake brother! 
as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick. 
Come on, brave doubt the day, 
And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.
3 KING HENRY VI 

WARWICK:
What counsel, Edward from 
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
Hath pass'd in safety through the seas, 
And with his troops doth march amain to London;
And many people flock him. 

KING HENRY VI:
Let's levy men, and beat him back again. 
 
CLARENCE: 
A little fire is quickly trodden out;
Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench. 

WARWICK: 
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends, 
Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence, 
stir up Suffolk, Norfolk, in Kent, 
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:
Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham, 
Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find
Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:
thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved, 
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
My with the citizens, 
Like to island girt in with the ocean, 
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
Shall rest in London till we come to him.
Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.
Farewell, my sovereign.

KING HENRY VI: 
my Hector, true hope. 
 
CLARENCE: 
In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.

KING HENRY VI: 
Well-minded be thou fortunate! 

MONTAGUE:
Comfort, my and so I take my leave. 
 
OXFORD:
And thus I seal and bid 

KING HENRY VI: 
Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
And all at once more a happy farewell. 
 

Farewell, let's meet at Coventry. 

KING VI: 
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Should not be able to encounter mine.
 
EXETER:
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.

KING HENRY VI:
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
I not stopp'd to demands, 
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
My pity hath been heal their wounds, 
My mildness allay'd their 
My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
I have not been desirous of their wealth,
Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies. 
Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:
Then why should they love Edward more than me?
Exeter, these graces challenge grace: 
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
The will never cease to 
 
EXETER: 
Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;
And once proclaim us King of England. 
are fount that makes small brooks flow: 
stops thy my sea sha$l them dry, 
And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
Hence with him to the let him not speak. 
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course
Where peremptory Warwick now 
sun shines and, if use delay, 
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.
 
GLOUCESTER:
betimes, his forces 
And take the great-grown traitor unawares:
Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.
3 KING HENRY VI 

WARWICK:
Where is post came from valiant Oxford? 
How hence thy lord, mine honest fellow? 


By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.

WARWICK: 
How far off is our brother Montague?
Where is the post that came from Montague?
 
Second Messenger:
this at Daintry, with a puissant troop. 

WARWICK:
Say, Somerville, says my loving son? 
And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?

SOMERSET: 
At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
And do expect him here some two hours hence.

WARWICK: 
Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.


It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
The drum honour hears from 

WARWICK:
Who should that be? unlook'd-for 

SOMERSET: 
They at hand, and you shall quickly know. 

IV: 
trumpet, to the a 

GLOUCESTER:
See how surly Warwick mans the wall! 

WARWICK:
O unbid is Edward come? 
Where slept or how are they seduced, 
That we could hear news of his repair? 
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee, 
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.

WARWICK: 
wilt draw forces hence, 
Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
And thou shalt still remain Duke York. 

GLOUCESTER:
I thought, at least, he would have said the king;
Or did he the jest against his will? 
 
WARWICK:
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?

GLOUCESTER: 
Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
I'll do thee service for so good a gift.

WARWICK:
'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.


Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry is king, Warwick subject. 

KING 
But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner: 
And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this: 
What is the body when head is off? 

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
But, whiles thought to steal the single ten, 
king was finger'd from the deck! 
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
And, ten one, you'll him in the Tower. 

EDWARD: 
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:
Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
 
WARWICK:
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
And with the other fling it at thy face,
Than low a sail, to strike to thee. 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair
Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,
'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'

WARWICK:
O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
 
OXFORD: 
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
 
GLOUCESTER:
The gates are open, let us enter too.
 
KING IV: 
So other foes may set upon our backs.
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
Will issue out again and us battle: 
If not, the city being but of small defence,
We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
 
WARWICK:
O, welcome, Oxford! for we 
 
MONTAGUE:
Montague, for 
 
GLOUCESTER:
Thou and thy both buy this treason 
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
 
KING EDWARD IV:
The harder the greater victory: 
My mind happy gain and conquest. 


Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
Two of thy Dukes of 
Have sold their lives unto the house of York;
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
 
WARWICK:
And lo, George of Clarence sweeps along, 
force enough bid his brother battle; 
With whom an upright zeal to prevails 
More than the nature of a brother's love!
Come, Clarence, thou wilt, if Warwick 

CLARENCE: 
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
Look here, I throw my infamy at thee 
I will not ruinate father's house, 
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
To bend the fatal of 
Against his brother and his lawful king?
Perhaps thou object holy oath: 
To keep oath were more impiety 
Than Jephthah's, he his daughter. 
I so for my trespass made 
That, to at my brother's hands, 
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
With wheresoe'er I meet thee-- 
As will meet thee, if abroad-- 
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee, 
to my brother turn my blushing cheeks. 
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends: 
And, do frown upon my faults, 
For henceforth be no more unconstant. 

EDWARD IV: 
Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved, 
Than thou never deserved our hate. 

GLOUCESTER: 
Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.

WARWICK:
O passing traitor, unjust! 

KING EDWARD IV:
What, Warwick, wilt leave the town and fight? 
Or shall we beat stones about thine ears? 
 
WARWICK:
Alas, I am not here for defence! 
I will away towards Barnet presently,
And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way. 
Lords, to Saint George and victory! 
3 VI 

KING EDWARD IV:
So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all. 
Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.

WARWICK:
Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
Why ask that? my mangled body shows, 
My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows. 
I must yield my body to earth 
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
Thus cedar to the axe's edge, 
Whose to the eagle, 
Under the lion slept, 
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
To search the secret treasons of the world: 
The wrinkles my brows, filled with blood, 
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;
For lived I could dig his 
And who mine when Warwick bent 
now glory smear'd in dust blood! 
My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.
Even now forsake and of all 
Is nothing left me but my body's length.
what pomp, rule, earth and 
And, live we how we can, yet die we must.
 

Ah, Warwick, as we are. 
We might recover all our loss again; 
The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:
Even now heard the ah, could'st thou fly! 
 
WARWICK: 
Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
If thou there, sweet take my hand. 
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
glues and will not me speak. 
Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick! Montague breathed his last; 
the latest gasp cried out for Warwick, 
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
more he would and he spoke, 
Which sounded a clamour in a 
That mought not be distinguished; but last 
I well hear, delivered with a groan, 
'O, farewell, Warwick!'
 
WARWICK:
Sweet rest his Fly, lords, and save yourselves; 
For Warwick bids you all farewell to heaven. 
 
OXFORD:
Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!
3 KING HENRY VI
 
KING EDWARD 
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
That will encounter with our glorious sun,
Ere he attain his western 
I my that the queen 
Hath raised in have arrived our 
And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.


A little gale will soon disperse cloud 
And blow it to the source from whence it came:
The very beams will dry those vapours up, 
For every cloud engenders not a storm.
 

The queen is thousand 
Somerset, with Oxford fled to her: 
If she time to breathe be well assured 
Her faction will be full as strong as ours.

KING EDWARD IV:
We are advertised by our loving friends 
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
We, having now the best at Barnet field,
Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;
And, as we march, our strength will be augmented
every county we go 
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.
3 KING HENRY VI


Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
What though the mast be now blown overboard,
The cable broke, holding-anchor lost, 
half our sailors swallow'd 
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he 
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength to that which hath too much,
Whiles, moan, the ship splits on the 
Which industry and courage might have saved?
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
Say Warwick was anchor; what of that? 
And Montague topmost; of him? 
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor? 
And Somerset another goodly mast?
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
shelves rocks that threaten with wreck. 
As good to chide the waves as speak them 
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
What Clarence but of deceit? 
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock? 
All these the enemies to our poor bark.
Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
Bestride the the tide will wash you off, 
Or else you that's threefold death. 
This speak lords, to let you understand, 
If some of would from us, 
That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided
'Twere childish to lament or fear. 
 
PRINCE EDWARD:
Methinks a woman valiant spirit 
Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,
Infuse his breast with magnanimity
And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
I speak not this as doubting any here
For I but suspect a fearful man 
He to away 
Lest in our need he might infect another
And make him like spirit to 
If any such be here--as God forbid!--
Let him depart before we need his help.

OXFORD:
Women and children of so high a 
why, 'twere perpetual shame. 
O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
Doth live again in thee: long thou live 
To bear his image and renew his glories!
 
SOMERSET: 
he will not fight for such a hope. 
Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,
If he be and at. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
 
PRINCE EDWARD: 
And take thanks that yet hath nothing else. 

Messenger:
Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.

OXFORD: 
I no less: it is policy 
To haste thus to us unprovided. 
 
SOMERSET: 
But he's deceived; we are in readiness.
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
heart, to see your forwardness. 

OXFORD: 
Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge. 

EDWARD IV: 
Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
heavens' assistance and your strength, 
Must by the roots be hewn yet ere 
I need not more fuel to your fire, 
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
Give signal to the fight, and to it, 

QUEEN MARGARET: 
Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say 
My tears gainsay; every word I speak, 
Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes. 
Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,
Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,
His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
You in justice: then, God's name, lords, 
Be valiant and give signal to the fight.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
here a period of broils. 
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle 
For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.


For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
 
SOMERSET:
Nor I, but with to my 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
So part we sadly in this troublous world,
To with in sweet Jerusalem. 

KING EDWARD IV:
Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
Shall have a high reward, and he his life?

GLOUCESTER:
is: lo, where youthful Edward 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Bring the gallant, let us hear speak. 
What! can so young a thorn begin to prick? 
Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
 
PRINCE EDWARD:
Speak subject, proud York! 
Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;
Resign thy chair, and where I stand thou, 
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,
Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.
 
QUEEN MARGARET: 
that father had been so resolved! 

GLOUCESTER: 
That you might still worn petticoat, 
And have the from Lancaster. 
 
PRINCE EDWARD: 
Let night; 
His currish riddles sort not with this place.
 
GLOUCESTER:
By heaven, brat, I'll plague word. 

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, thou wast born to be a to men. 

GLOUCESTER: 
For God's take away this captive scold. 

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, take scolding crookback rather. 

KING EDWARD IV: 
Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.

CLARENCE:
Untutor'd lad, art too malapert. 

PRINCE 
I know are undutiful: 
Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,
thou Dick, I all 
I am your better, as are: 
And thou usurp'st father's right and mine. 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Take that, thou likeness of this railer here. 

GLOUCESTER:
Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.

CLARENCE:
And there's for twitting me perjury. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
O, me too! 


Marry, and shall. 
 
EDWARD IV: 
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.

GLOUCESTER:
Why should live, fill world with words? 
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.

GLOUCESTER:
Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother; 
I'll hence to London on a serious matter:
Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.


What? what? 
 
GLOUCESTER:
The Tower, Tower. 
 
QUEEN MARGARET:
O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,
Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,
If this foul deed were by to equal it:
He a man; this, in respect, a 
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
What's worse than murderer, I may name it? 
No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
I speak, that so heart burst. 
and villains! 
How sweet plant have you untimely 
You no children, butchers! if had, 
The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:
But if you ever chance to have a child,
Look in his youth to have him so cut off
As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!

KING EDWARD IV: 
Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.

QUEEN MARGARET: 
Nay, bear me hence, dispatch me here, 
Here sheathe thy I'll pardon thee my death: 
not? then, Clarence, do thou. 

CLARENCE: 
By heaven, I will not thee much ease. 

QUEEN 
Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do 

CLARENCE: 
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity. 
What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,
Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?
Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;
Petitioners for blood thou ne'er back. 
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence. 

QUEEN MARGARET:
So you yours, as Prince! 
 
KING EDWARD IV:
Where's Richard gone?
 
CLARENCE:
To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
a supper in the Tower. 
 
KING EDWARD IV: 
He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
Now march hence: discharge the common sort 
With pay and thanks, and let's away to London 
And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.
3 KING HENRY VI 

GLOUCESTER:
Good day, my at book so hard? 

KING HENRY VI: 
Ay, good lord:--my lord, should say rather; 
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:
'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' alike, 
And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'

GLOUCESTER: 
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.

HENRY 
So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
What of hath Roscius to act? 

GLOUCESTER:
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
The thief doth fear each bush an officer. 
 
KING HENRY VI:

With wings misdoubteth every 
And the male to one sweet bird, 
Have now the fatal object in my eye
my young was limed, caught and 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
That his the office a fowl! 
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd. 

KING HENRY 
Daedalus; my poor boy, 
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
sun that the of my sweet boy 
Thy brother Edward, and the sea 
Whose envious gulf did swallow up life. 
Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words! 
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
can my ears that tragic history. 
But wherefore dost thou come? for my life? 
 
GLOUCESTER: 
Think'st thou I am an executioner?

KING HENRY VI:
A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:
If be executing, 
Why, then thou art an executioner.

GLOUCESTER: 
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.

KING HENRY VI:
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
And many orphan's eye-- 
Men their sons, wives their husbands, 
And orphans for their parents timeless death--
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.

The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
Dogs and tempest shook down trees; 
raven rook'd her the chimney's 
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
And, forth less a mother's hope, 
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
To signify to bite the world: 
And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
Thou camest--

GLOUCESTER: 
I'll hear more: die, 
For this amongst the rest, I ordain'd. 

VI: 
and for much more after this. 
forgive my and pardon thee! 


What, will of Lancaster 
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
See my sword weeps for the king's death! 
O, may such purple tears be alway shed

Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;
For I have often heard my mother say
I came into the world with my legs forward: 
Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
And seek their ruin that usurp'd right? 
The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
'O, Jesus us, he is with teeth!' 
And so was; which plainly signified 
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
since the heavens have my body so, 
Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
I have no brother, I am like no brother;
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
Be resident in men like one another 
And not in me: I am myself alone.
Clarence, beware; thou me the light: 
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
For I will buz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
King Henry and the prince son are gone: 
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
Counting myself bad till I be best. 
throw body in another room 
And triumph, day doom. 
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Once more we sit in England's royal 
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
And two braver men 
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
them, the two bears, Warwick Montague, 
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
And made our footstool of security.
Come hither, Bess, and my 
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.
 


KING IV: 
Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen; 
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
 
CLARENCE:
The duty that I owe unto your majesty 
I seal upon lips of this 
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH: 
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, 


And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now seated as my soul 
Having my country's peace loves. 

CLARENCE:
What will your grace have done with Margaret?
Reignier, her father, to the king of France
Hath the Sicils and Jerusalem, 
And have they sent it for her 
 
EDWARD IV: 
Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
now what rests that spend the time 
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows, 
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
For here, I begins our lasting joy. 
 
ARCHIDAMUS: 
If you shall Camillo, to Bohemia, 
the like occasion whereon my services are now on
foot, you shall as I great 
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
 
ARCHIDAMUS: 
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified our loves; for indeed-- 
 
CAMILLO: 
Beseech you,-- 
 
ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
cannot with magnificence--in so rare--I know 
not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
us.
 
CAMILLO:
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.


Believe me, I as my understanding 
and as honesty puts to utterance. 

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot show himself to Bohemia. 
They were trained together in their childhoods; and
there rooted betwixt them then such an 
cannot choose but branch now. Since their 
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
of their society, their 
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts, letters, 
that they have seemed to together, 
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
winds. The heavens continue their loves! 
 
ARCHIDAMUS: 
I think there is not in the world either malice or
matter to it. have an unspeakable 
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
of the greatest that ever came 
into note. 


I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
is gallant child; one that indeed physics the 
subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that on 
crutches ere he born desire yet their life to 
see him a man.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they else be content to die?
 
CAMILLO:
Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
to live. 

ARCHIDAMUS:
If the king had no son, they would desire to live
on crutches till he had one.

POLIXENES: 
Nine changes of the star been 
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
Without a burthen: time as long again
Would be find up, with our 
And yet we should, 
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
That go before it.


Stay your thanks a while;
And pay them when you part.
 
POLIXENES:
Sir, that's to-morrow.
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
Or breed upon our absence; may 
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
'This is put forth too truly:' I have stay'd 
To tire your royalty.

LEONTES: 
We are tougher, brother,
Than you put us to't. 
 
POLIXENES:
No longer stay. 
 
LEONTES:
One seven-night longer. 
 
POLIXENES:
Very sooth, to-morrow.
 
LEONTES:
We'll part the time between's then; and in that
I'll no gainsaying. 
 
POLIXENES:
Press me not, beseech so. 
There no tongue that moves, none, none i' world, 
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
Were there in your request, although 
'Twere needful I denied it. My 
Do even drag me homeward: which hinder 
Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
Farewell, our

Tongue-tied, our queen?

I had sir, to have my peace until 
You have oaths from him not to You, sir, 
Charge too coldly. Tell him, are sure 
All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
He's beat from his best ward.
 
LEONTES:
Well said, Hermione. 

HERMIONE: 
To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
But let him say so then, and let him go;
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs. 
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
To let him there a month behind the gest
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
lady-she her lord. stay? 
 

No, madam. 

HERMIONE:
Nay, but you will?

POLIXENES:
I may not, verily.

HERMIONE:
Verily! 
You put me off with limber vows; but I,
Though you would seek to unsphere the
stars with oaths,
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
me to you as a 
Not like a so you shall pay your fees 
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
One of them you shall be.
 
POLIXENES: 
Your guest, then, madam:
be your should import offending; 
Which is for me less easy to commit
you to punish. 
 
HERMIONE:
your gaoler, 
your kind hostess. Come, question you 
Of lord's tricks and yours when were boys: 
pretty then? 

POLIXENES:
We were, fair queen,
Two lads that thought there was no behind 
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
And to be boy eternal.

HERMIONE:
Was not my lord
The verier wag o' the two? 
 
POLIXENES: 
We were as twinn'd lambs did frisk i' the sun, 
And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
That any did. Had we pursued life, 
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
Hereditary ours. 
 
HERMIONE:
By this gather 
You have tripp'd since. 

POLIXENES: 
O my most sacred lady!
Temptations have since then been born for 
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
Your self had then not cross'd the eyes 
Of my young play-fellow.
 
HERMIONE: 
Grace to boot!
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not 
any but with us. 

LEONTES:
Is he won yet?

HERMIONE:
He'll stay my lord.
 
LEONTES: 
At my request he would not.
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
To better purpose. 
 

Never? 
 

Never, but 

HERMIONE: 
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
Our praises are wages: ride's 
With soft kiss a thousand ere 
With spur we beat an acre. But the goal: 
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
What was my first? it has an elder sister,
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace! 
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
Nay, let me have't; I long.

LEONTES: 
Why, that was when
Three crabbed months sour'd themselves 
Ere thee open white 
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
'I am yours for ever.'

HERMIONE:
'Tis grace indeed.
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice: 
The one for ever earn'd royal 
The other for some while a friend.
 
LEONTES:
 
MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES: 
I' 
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
smutch'd thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain, 
We must neat; not neat, but captain: 
And the the heifer and the calf 
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling 
his palm!--How now, you calf! 
Art thou my calf?

MAMILLIUS:
if you will, lord. 

LEONTES: 
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
To be full like they say are 
Almost as like as eggs; women say so, 
That will say anything but were they false
As blacks, as as waters, false 
As dice are to be by one that fixes 
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true 
To say this boy like sir page, 
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre: 
Thou dost make possible not 
Communicatest dreams;--how can this be?-- 
what's unreal thou coactive art, 
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
And that beyond commission, and I find it,
And that to the infection of my brains
And hardening of my brows.

POLIXENES:
What means Sicilia? 
 
HERMIONE: 
He something seems unsettled.

POLIXENES: 
How, my lord!
What how is't with you, 
 
HERMIONE:
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
Are you moved, my lord?
 
LEONTES: 
No, in good earnest.
How sometimes nature will its folly, 
tenderness, and make itself a pastime 
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should bite its master, so prove, 
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
How like, methought, I then was to this 
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
Will you take eggs 
 

No, my lord, I'll fight.

LEONTES:
You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother, 
Are you so fond of your young as we 
Do seem to be of ours?

POLIXENES: 
If at home, sir,
He's all my exercise, mirth, my matter, 
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
He makes a short as December, 
And with his varying childness cures in me 
Thoughts that would thick my blood.

LEONTES:
So stands this squire
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
And leave you to your graver Hermione, 
How lovest us, show in our brother's welcome; 
Let what is dear in be cheap: 
Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
Apparent to my heart. 
 

If you would seek us,
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?

LEONTES: 
your bents dispose you: you'll be found, 
Be you 
I am angling now, 
Though you perceive me how I give line. 
Go to, go to!
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him! 
And arms her with the boldness of a wife
To her allowing husband! 
Gone already!
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
ears a fork'd one!
boy, thy mother plays, and I 
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour 
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. 
There have been, 
Or I deceived, cuckolds now; 
many man there even at this present, 
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
fish'd by his next neighbour, by 
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't 
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
As mine, against their will. Should all despair
That wives, the mankind 
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
It a bawdy planet, that will strike 
Where 'tis predominant; and powerful, it, 
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
No barricado for a know't; 
It let in and out the enemy 
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!
 
MAMILLIUS: 
I am you, they 
 
LEONTES: 
Why some What, Camillo there? 

CAMILLO:
Ay, my good lord.
 
LEONTES: 
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt honest man. 
Camillo, this great sir yet stay 
 
CAMILLO: 
had much ado to his anchor 
When you cast out, it still came home.
 
LEONTES: 
Didst note it?
 

He would not stay at your petitions: made
His business more material.

LEONTES:
it? 
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis gone, 
When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
That he did stay?

CAMILLO: 
At the good queen's entreaty.
 

At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
But, so it is, it not. Was this taken 
By pate but 
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
More than the common blocks: not noted, is't, 
But of the finer natures? by some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance are to this business purblind? say.

CAMILLO:
Business, my lord! I think most understand 
Bohemia stays here longer.


Ha! 

CAMILLO:
Stays here longer. 

LEONTES: 
Ay, but why?

CAMILLO:
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
Of our most gracious mistress.
 
LEONTES:
Satisfy!
The entreaties your mistress! satisfy! 
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou 
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have 
Deceived in deceived 
In that which 
 
CAMILLO: 
Be it forbid, my lord!

LEONTES:
To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
hoxes honesty behind, 
From course required; or else thou must counted 
grafted in my serious trust 
And therein or else a fool 
That a game play'd the rich stake 
And takest it all for jest. 

CAMILLO:
My gracious lord,
I may be foolish and fearful; 
In every one of these no is free, 
But his negligence, folly, fear, 
Among the infinite doings of the world,
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
It was my folly; if industriously
the fool, was my negligence, 
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
To do a thing, where I 
Where of the execution did cry out
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear 
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
such allow'd that honesty 
Is never free of. But, beseech your 
Be plainer with me; let know trespass 
By its own visage: if I then deny it,
'Tis none of mine.

LEONTES:
Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass 
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision apparent 
Cannot be thought,--for cogitation 
Resides not in that man that not think,-- 
My wife slippery? thou wilt confess, 
Or else be impudently negative, 
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say 
My wife's a deserves a name 
As rank as flax-wench that puts to 
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't. 

CAMILLO:
I would not be a stander-by to hear
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
My present vengeance 'shrew my heart, 
You spoke did become you 
Than this; which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that, though true.

LEONTES: 
Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses? 
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
laughing sigh?--a note infallible 
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot? 
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
Blind with pin and but theirs only, 
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
Why, then the world and all that's in't nothing; 
The covering sky nothing; 
My wife nothing have these nothings, 
If this be nothing.

CAMILLO: 
Good my lord, be cured
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
For 'tis most dangerous.

LEONTES: 
Say be, true. 
 
CAMILLO: 
No, no, my lord.
 
LEONTES:
It is; you lie, you lie:
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
Pronounce thee a lout, a mindless 
Or else a hovering temporizer, 
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil, 
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
Infected as her life, she would not live
The running of glass. 


Who does her? 

LEONTES:
Why, he that wears her like a hanging 
About neck, Bohemia: who, if I 
Had servants true about me, bare eyes 
To see alike mine honour as profits, 
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
should undo more doing: ay, and thou, 
His I from meaner form 
benched and reared to who mayst see 
Plainly as heaven sees and sees 
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
Which draught to me cordial. 
 
CAMILLO:
my lord, 
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
But with a dram that not work 
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly being honourable. 
I have loved thee,--
 
LEONTES:
Make that thy question, and go rot!
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
Which preserve is which being spotted 
Is goads, thorns, nettles, of wasps, 
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince 
I do think is mine and love as 
Without ripe moving to't? I do this? 
Could man blench? 

CAMILLO: 
must believe you, sir: 
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
your queen as yours at first, 
for your son's and thereby for sealing 
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
and allied to yours. 

LEONTES: 
Thou dost advise me 
Even so as I mine own course have set down:
I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.
 
CAMILLO: 
My lord, 
Go then; and with countenance as clear 
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia 
And with your I am his cupbearer: 
from he have wholesome beverage, 
Account me not your servant.
 
LEONTES: 
This is all:
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
Do't split'st thine own. 

CAMILLO: 
do't, my lord. 

LEONTES: 
I will seem as thou advised me. 
 
CAMILLO:
O miserable lady! But, for me,
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
Of ground to do't 
Is the obedience to a master, one 
Who in rebellion with himself will have
All that are his so To do this 
Promotion follows. If I could find example
thousands that had struck anointed 
And flourish'd after, I'ld not but since 
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment not one, 
Let itself forswear't. must 
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain 
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
Here comes Bohemia. 

POLIXENES:
This is strange: methinks
favour here begins to warp. Not speak? 
Good day, Camillo.

CAMILLO: 
Hail, most royal sir! 


What is the news i' the court? 

CAMILLO:
None rare, my lord.

POLIXENES:
The king hath on him such a countenance
As he had lost some province and a region
Loved as loves himself: even now I him 
With customary compliment; when he,
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling 
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
leaves me to consider what is breeding 
That changeth thus his manners.

CAMILLO:
I dare not know, my lord.
 
POLIXENES: 
How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
For, to yourself, you do know, you must. 
And cannot say, you not. Good Camillo, 
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
A party in this alteration, finding
Myself thus alter'd with 't. 
 
CAMILLO:
a sickness 
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
cannot name the and it is caught 
Of you that are well. 

POLIXENES: 
How! caught of me!
Make me sighted like the basilisk: 
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
Clerk-like experienced, which less 
Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
to be inform'd, not 
In ignorant concealment.
 
CAMILLO: 
I may not answer.

POLIXENES:
A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
I answer'd. Dost thou Camillo, 
I conjure thee, by all the of man 
Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare 
What incidency thou guess of harm 
Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
Which way to be prevented, if to be;
If not, how best to bear it.
 
CAMILLO: 
Sir, I will tell you;
Since I am charged in honour and by him
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
Cry lost, and so good night!
 
POLIXENES:
On, good Camillo.

CAMILLO:
I am appointed him to murder you.

POLIXENES: 
By whom, Camillo?
 
CAMILLO: 
By the king.
 
POLIXENES:
For what? 

CAMILLO: 
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
As he had seen't or been an 
To vice you to't, have touch'd 
Forbiddenly. 

POLIXENES:
O, then my best blood turn 
To an infected jelly and my name
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
then my freshest reputation to 
A that may strike dullest nostril 
Where arrive, my approach shunn'd, 
Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
That e'er was heard or read!

CAMILLO:
his thought over 
By each particular star in heaven and 
By all influences, you may as well 
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation 
piled upon faith will continue 
standing of his body. 


How should this grow? 

CAMILLO: 
I not: but I am sure 'tis safer to 
Avoid what's grown question how 'tis born. 
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
Your followers I will whisper to the business,
And will by twos and threes at several posterns
Clear them the city. For myself, I'll put 
My fortunes to your service, which are here 
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
For, by the honour of my parents, I
Have utter'd truth: if you seek to prove, 
I dare stand nor shall you be safer 
Than one condemn'd by the king's thereon 
His execution sworn. 

POLIXENES:
I do thee: 
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
My people did expect my hence departure
Two days ago. This jealousy
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
He dishonour'd by a man which 
Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
Good be my friend, and comfort 
The queen, part of his theme, but nothing 
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, 
I will respect thee as 
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

CAMILLO:
It is in mine authority to command
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away. 
 
HERMIONE:
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
'Tis past enduring.
 
First Lady: 
Come, my gracious lord,
Shall I be your playfellow? 
 
MAMILLIUS:
No, I'll of you. 

First Lady: 
Why, my sweet 
 
MAMILLIUS:
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I better. 

Second Lady:
And why so, my lord?
 
MAMILLIUS: 
Not for because 
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
Become some women best, so that there be not
much hair there, in a semicircle 
Or a half-moon made with a pen.

Second Lady: 
Who taught you this? 
 
MAMILLIUS:
I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
What colour are your eyebrows?
 
First Lady: 
Blue, lord. 
 
MAMILLIUS: 
Nay, that's a mock: I seen a lady's nose 
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

First Lady:
Hark ye;
The queen mother rounds apace: 
Present our services to a fine new prince
One of these and then you'ld wanton with us, 
If we would have you. 

Lady: 
She is of late 
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!

HERMIONE: 
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now 
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
And tell 's a tale.
 
MAMILLIUS:
sad shall't 
 
HERMIONE:
As merry as you will.

MAMILLIUS:
A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
Of sprites and 


Let's have that, good sir. 
Come sit on, and your best 
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

MAMILLIUS:
There was 
 
HERMIONE:
Nay, come, sit down; then on.

Yond crickets shall not 
 
HERMIONE:

And give't me in mine ear.


Was he met there? his Camillo with him? 

First Lord: 
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour on their way: I eyed them 
to their ships. 

LEONTES:
How am I 
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
In being so blest! There may be in the cup 
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
not infected: but one 
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
he hath drunk, cracks his gorge, his sides, 
With violent hefts. I have drunk,
and seen the spider.
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
There is a plot against my my crown; 
that is mistrusted: that false 
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
He has discover'd my design, and I
Remain a pinch'd yea, a very trick 
For them to play at will. How came the posterns
So easily open? 
 
First Lord:
his great authority; 
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
On your command. 

LEONTES: 
I know't too well.
Give me boy: I glad you did not nurse him: 
Though he does bear some signs of me, 
Have too much blood in him.

HERMIONE: 
What is this? sport? 
 
LEONTES:
Bear the boy hence; he shall come about her; 
Away with him! and let her sport herself
With that she's big with; for 'tis 
Has made thee thus. 
 
HERMIONE:
But I'ld say he not, 
And I'll be sworn you would believe saying, 
Howe'er you lean to the nayward. 

LEONTES:
You, my lords, 
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
To say 'she is a and 
The justice of your bearts will thereto add
'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
Praise her but for this her without-door form,
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands 
That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
That mercy does, for calumny sear 
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between 
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
She's an adulteress.
 
HERMIONE: 
Should a villain say so,
The most replenish'd villain in world, 
He were as much more villain: you, lord, 
Do mistake. 
 

You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
Lest barbarism, me the precedent, 
Should a like language use to all degrees
And mannerly leave out 
Betwixt the prince beggar: I have said 
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
A federary with her, and one that knows
What she should shame to know herself
with her most vile principal, that she's 
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
To this their late escape.

HERMIONE:
No, by my life. 
Privy to none of this. How will this 
When shall come to clearer knowledge, 
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
did mistake. 

LEONTES: 
No; if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon,
The centre is not big enough to bear
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he speaks.

HERMIONE:
There's some ill planet reigns:
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
am not prone to weeping, as our sex 
Commonly are; want of which vain dew 
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
honourable here burns 
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts qualified as your charities 
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and 
The king's will be perform'd!

LEONTES:
Shall I be heard? 

HERMIONE:
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
My women may be with me; you see 
plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools; 
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this action I now go on
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
I never to see you sorry; 
I trust you have leave. 


Go, do our 

First Lord:
Beseech your highness, call the queen again.

ANTIGONUS:
Be certain what you do, lest your justice 
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen, your son.

First Lord:
For her, my lord, 
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
you to accept it, that the queen is spotless 
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
In this which you accuse 

ANTIGONUS:
If it prove 
She's otherwise, I'll stables 
I lodge wife; I'll go couples with her; 
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
For every inch of woman in the world,
Ay, every dram of woman's is false, she be. 

LEONTES: 
Hold your peaces.
 
First Lord: 
Good my lord,-- 
 

It is we speak, for ourselves: 
You are abused and some putter-on 
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
The second and the third, nine, some five; 
If this prove they'll pay for't: 
by mine 
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
false generations: they are co-heirs; 
And had rather glib than they 
Should not produce fair issue.

LEONTES:
Cease; no more. 
You smell this business with a sense as cold
As a dead nose: do see't feel't 
As you feel doing thus; and see withal
The instruments that feel. 

ANTIGONUS:
If it 
We no grave to bury honesty: 
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten 
Of the whole dungy earth.

LEONTES: 
What! lack I credit?

First Lord:
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would content me
To have her honour true than your suspicion,
Be blamed for't how you might.

LEONTES: 
Why, what need we
Commune you of but rather 
Our forceful instigation? Our 
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied 
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
truth like us, inform 
We need no more your advice: 
The loss, the gain, ordering on't, is all 
Properly ours.
 
ANTIGONUS:
wish, my liege, 
You had only in silent judgment tried it, 
Without more 
 
LEONTES: 
How could that be?
Either thou art most ignorant by age,
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
Added to familiarity, 
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
But only seeing, all other 
up the doth push on this proceeding: 
Yet, for a greater confirmation,
an act of importance 'twere 
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple, 
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle 
They will bring spiritual counsel had, 
Shall stop spur me. Have I done well? 
 
First Lord:
done, my 

LEONTES:
Though I satisfied need no more 
Than what I know, shall the oracle 
Give rest minds of others, such as 
ignorant credulity will not 
Come to the So have it good 
From our free person should be confined, 
the treachery of the two fled hence 
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
We are to speak in public; for this business
Will raise us all.
 
ANTIGONUS: 
 
PAULINA:
The keeper of the prison, call to him;
let who am. 
Good lady,
No court in Europe is too good for thee; 
What dost thou then in prison?
Now, good sir,
You know me, do you 
 

For a worthy lady 
one whom I honour. 
 
PAULINA: 
Pray you then,
Conduct me to the queen. 

Gaoler: 
I may not, madam: 
To the contrary I have express commandment.

PAULINA: 
Here's ado, 
To lock up honesty and honour from
The access of gentle 
Is't lawful, pray you,
To see women? any them? Emilia? 

Gaoler: 
So please you, madam,
put apart these your attendants, I 
Shall forth. 

PAULINA: 
I pray call 
Withdraw yourselves.

Gaoler:
And, madam,
I must be present at your conference.


Well, be't so, prithee.
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
As passes colouring. 
Dear gentlewoman,
How fares our gracious lady? 
 
EMILIA:
As well as one so great and so forlorn
May hold together: on frights 
Which never tender lady hath born greater,
She is something her 

PAULINA:
A boy? 

EMILIA: 
daughter, a goodly babe, 
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner, 
I am innocent as 
 

I dare be sworn
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
beshrew them! 
must be on't, the office 
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me: 
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
And never to my red-look'd anger be
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
Commend my best obedience to the queen:
If she dares trust me with her little babe, 
I'll show't the and undertake to be 
advocate to loud'st. do not know 
How he may soften at the sight o' the child: 
The silence often of pure innocence 
Persuades when speaking fails.

EMILIA:
worthy madam, 
Your honour and your goodness is so evident
That your free undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue: there is no lady 
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
To the next room, I'll presently 
Acquaint queen of your most noble offer; 
but to-day hammer'd of this design, 
But not tempt a minister of honour, 
Lest she should be denied.

PAULINA:
Tell her, Emilia.
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
I shall do good.
 
EMILIA:
you blest for 
I'll to the queen: please you,
come something nearer.
 
Gaoler: 
Madam, if't please queen to the babe, 
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
Having no warrant.
 
PAULINA: 
You need not fear it, sir: 
child to the womb is 
By law process of nature 
Freed and enfranchised, a to 
anger of the king nor guilty of, 
If any be, the trespass of the queen.

Gaoler:
I do believe it.
 
PAULINA: 
Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
I will stand betwixt you and danger. 

LEONTES:
night nor day no rest: it is but weakness 
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
cause were not being,--part o' the cause, 
She the adulteress; for the harlot king
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
And level brain, but 
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
Might come to me again. Who's there?

First Servant: 
My lord? 
 
LEONTES:
does the boy? 

First Servant: 
He took rest to-night; 
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged. 
 
LEONTES:
To see his nobleness! 
Conceiving dishonour of his mother, 
He declined, took it deeply, 
fix'd shame on't in himself, 
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
And downright Leave me solely: go, 
See how he fares. 
Fie, fie! no of him: 
The thought of my revenges that way
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
Take it on her. Camillo 
Laugh at make their at my sorrow: 
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
Shall she within my power.

First Lord:
You must not enter. 

PAULINA: 
Nay, good lords, be to me: 
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
More free than he is jealous.

ANTIGONUS: 
That's enough.

Second Servant:
Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
should come him. 

PAULINA: 
Not so good sir: 
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
At each his needless heavings, such as you
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
Do come with words as medicinal as true,
Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
That presses him from sleep.

LEONTES:
What noise there, ho?

PAULINA:
No my lord; but needful 
About some gossips for your highness.

LEONTES: 

Away with audacious lady! Antigonus, 
I charged thee that she should not come me: 
I knew she would.

ANTIGONUS:
I told her so, my lord,
On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
She should not visit you.
 
LEONTES: 
What, canst not rule 
 
PAULINA: 
From all dishonesty he can: in this,
Unless he take the course that you have done,
Commit for committing honour, trust it, 
He shall not rule me.

ANTIGONUS: 
La you now, you 
When she will take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not stumble.

PAULINA:
Good liege, 
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
appear so in comforting evils, 
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
From queen. 
 
LEONTES: 
Good queen! 
 

Good queen, 
Good queen; I say good queen;
And would by combat make her good, so were I
A man, the worst about you.

LEONTES: 
Force her hence.

PAULINA:
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
first do my errand. good queen, 
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
'tis; commends it to your 


Out!
A mankind witch! with her, out o' 
A most intelligencing 
 
PAULINA:
Not so:
I am as ignorant in that as you
In so entitling and no honest 
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
As world goes, to pass for honest. 

LEONTES: 
Traitors!
Will you not her out? Give her the bastard. 
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
Take't up, say; give't thy crone. 
 
PAULINA: 
For ever 
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
Which he has put upon't!
 
LEONTES: 
He dreads his wife. 

PAULINA:
So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt 
call your children yours. 

LEONTES:
A nest of traitors!
 
ANTIGONUS: 
I am none, by this good light.

PAULINA:
Nor I, nor any
But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
His hopeful son's, his babe's, to slander, 
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;
and will not--
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
The root his opinion, which is rotten 
As ever oak or stone was sound.


A callat
Of tongue, who hath her husband 
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
is the of Polixenes: 
Hence with and together with the dam 
Commit them to the fire!
 
PAULINA:

And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords, 
Although the print be little, the whole matter
And copy of the eye, nose, lip, 
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The pretty of his chin and cheek, 
His smiles,
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
So like to him that if thou hast 
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours 
No yellow in't, lest he does,

And, lozel, art worthy be hang'd, 
That wilt not stay tongue. 

ANTIGONUS: 
Hang all the husbands
That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
Hardly one 

LEONTES:
Once more, take her hence.

PAULINA: 
most unworthy and unnatural 
Can do no 
 
LEONTES:
I'll ha' thee burnt.

PAULINA: 
I care not: 
It is an heretic that makes the fire,
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
But most cruel usage of your queen, 
Not able produce more accusation 
Than your weak-hinged fancy, something savours 
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
scandalous to the 

LEONTES:
On your allegiance,
Out the chamber with her! Were I tyrant, 
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
If she did know me one. Away with her!

PAULINA:
I pray you, do push me; be gone. 
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours: 
Jove send her
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
that are thus so tender o'er his 
Will never do him good, one of you. 
So, so: farewell; 

LEONTES:
Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife this. 
My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
heart so tender o'er it, take it hence 
And see it instantly consumed with 
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
this hour bring word 'tis done, 
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
With thou else call'st thine. 
And wilt with my wrath, say so; 
The bastard brains with these my proper hands
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
For thou set'st on thy wife.
 
ANTIGONUS:
did not, sir: 
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please, 
Can clear me in't.
 
Lords: 
We can: my royal liege,
guilty of her coming hither. 

LEONTES: 
You're liars all.

First Lord:
Beseech your highness, give us 
We have always truly served you, and beseech you 
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
recompense of our dear 
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,

Lead on to some foul issue: we all

And call me father? better burn it now 
Than curse it But it; let it live. 
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
You that have been so tenderly 
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
To save this life,--for a bastard, 
sure this beard's grey,

To save life?

little blood which I have left 
To save the innocent: thing possible. 


It shall be possible. Swear by this sword

Of any in't shall be 
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee, 
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
This female hence and that thou bear it 
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions, and there thou it, 
Without more mercy, to own protection 
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
It came I in charge thee, 
thy soul's peril and thy torture, 
That thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
 
ANTIGONUS:
I swear to do this, though a present death
Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
To nurses! Wolves and they say 
their savageness done 
Like of pity. Sir, be 
more than this does require! And blessing 
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!

No, rear

I loved him as in honour he required,
With such a of love as become

So and no other, as commanded: 
Which not to have done I think had been in me

HERMIONE: 
Sir,
You speak language that I understand not: 
My life stands in the level of your dreams,

LEONTES: 
Your are my dreams; 
You had a bastard by Polixenes,
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:

Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
I do refer me to the oracle:
be my judge! 

First Lord:
This your request 
Is altogether just: therefore forth, 
And in Apollos name, his oracle.
 
HERMIONE:
The Emperor of Russia was my father:
O that he were alive, and here beholding
His daughter's trial! that he did but see
The flatness of my misery, yet eyes 
Of pity, not 
 
Officer:
You here swear upon this sword justice, 
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from thence brought 
The seal'd-up oracle, the hand deliver'd 
Of great priest; and that, then, 
You have not dared to break the holy seal
Nor read the secrets 

CLEOMENES: 
All this we 

LEONTES: 
Break up the seals and read.

Officer:
 
Lords: 
Now blessed be the great Apollo!
 
HERMIONE:
Praised! 
 
LEONTES: 
Hast thou read truth?
 

Ay, my so 
As it is here set down.

LEONTES: 
There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
The shall proceed: this is mere falsehood. 

Servant: 
My lord the king, the king!

LEONTES:
What is the business?

Servant:
O sir, I be hated report it! 
The prince your son, with mere conceit and 
Of the queen's speed, is gone.

LEONTES:
How! gone!

Servant: 
Is dead.

LEONTES:
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
Do strike at my injustice.
How there! 
 

This news to the queen: look down 
And see what death is doing.
 
LEONTES: 
Take her hence:
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life.
pardon 
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
I'll reconcile me Polixenes, 
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo, 
Whom I proclaim a man truth, of mercy; 
being by jealousies 
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
Camillo for the poison 
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
But the good of Camillo tardied 
My swift though death with 
Reward threaten and encourage him, 
Not and being done: he, most humane 
And fill'd with honour, to kingly guest 
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
Which you knew great, and to the hazard
Of all encertainties himself commended, 
No richer than his honour: how he glisters
Thorough my rust! and how his pity
Does my deeds make the blacker! 
 
PAULINA: 
Woe the while!
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
Break too. 

First Lord:
What fit this, good 

PAULINA: 
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling? 
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Must I receive, whose every word deserves 
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny 
Together working with thy jealousies,
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
And then run mad indeed, for all 
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it. 
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
That did but show thee, of fool, inconstant 
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
wouldst poison'd good Camillo's honour, 
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
To be none little; though 
Would water of fire done't: 
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
high one so tender, cleft the 
That could conceive a gross foolish sire 
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
to thy but the last,--O 
I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen, 
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
and vengeance for't
Not dropp'd down yet.
 
First Lord: 
The higher powers forbid!

PAULINA:
I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring 
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
Heat outwardly or breath within, serve you 
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
Upon a barren mountain and still winter 
In storm perpetual, could not move gods 
To look that way thou wert. 

LEONTES:
Go go on 
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved 
All tongues to talk bitterest. 

First Lord: 
Say no more:
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault 
I' the boldness of your speech.

PAULINA:
I am sorry for't:
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
rashness of a woman: he is touch'd 
To the noble heart. What's gone what's past help 
Should be do not receive affliction 
At my petition; I beseech you, rather
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
you forget. Now, good my liege 
Sir, royal sir, forgive a woman: 
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
speak of her no more, nor of your children; 
I'll not remember you of my own 
Who lost too: take your patience to 
And I'll say nothing.

LEONTES: 
Thou speak but well 
When the truth; I better 
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
The causes of their death unto 
Our shame Once a day I'll visit 
The chapel where tears shed there 
be my recreation: so long as 
Will bear up with this exercise, so long
I vow use it. Come and 
Unto these sorrows.

ANTIGONUS: 
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts Bohemia? 
 
Mariner:
Ay, my lord: and fear
We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly 
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
The with that we have in hand are angry 
And frown upon 's.
 

Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
to bark: I'll not be long before 
I call 
 
Mariner:
Make your best haste, and go not
Too far i' the land: 'tis to loud 
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures 
Of prey that keep upon't.

ANTIGONUS:
thou away: 
I'll follow instantly.

Mariner: 
I am glad at heart
To be rid o' the business. 

ANTIGONUS: 
Come, poor babe:
I have heard, but 
the spirits dead 
May walk again: such be, thy mother 
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
never of 
So fill'd and so becoming: in white robes, 
Like very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
And to begin some her eyes 
Became two spouts: the fury anon 
Did this her: 'Good Antigonus, 
Since fate, against thy 
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor according to oath, 
remote enough are in Bohemia, 
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
I prithee, call't. For ungentle business 
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er see 
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks 
She air. much, 
in time collect myself and thought 
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
Yet for this once, yea, 
I by this. I do believe 
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue 
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
There lie, there thy character: there these; 
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch, 
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have 
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
The heavens so dim by A clamour! 
I aboard! This is the 
I am gone for ever.
 
Shepherd:
I would there were no age between sixteen and
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
rest; for there is nothing in the between but
getting with child, wronging ancientry, 
stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
hunt this They have scared away two of my 
best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find
than master: if any where I have 'tis by 
the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
pretty a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape: 
though I am not bookish, yet I can read
waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
some some trunk-work, some 
behind-door-work: they were warmer got this 
than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
pity: yet I'll till my son come; he hallooed 
but even now. ho, hoa! 

Clown: 
Hilloa, loa!


What, art so If thou'lt see a thing to 
on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What
ailest thou, man?

Clown: 
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
am to say it is a sea, it is now the 
sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
a point. 
 
Shepherd:
Why, boy, how is 

Clown:
I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the 
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
cork into a hogshead. And then for the
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said 
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. to an 
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
sea mocked and how poor gentleman roared 
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
the 
 
Shepherd: 
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

Clown:
Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
sights: the are not cold under water, nor 
the half on he's at it 
now.
 
Shepherd:
Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!

Clown: 
I would you had been by side, to have 
helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing. 

Shepherd:
Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for
thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
child! thee here; up, take up, 
open't. So, see: it was told I should be 
rich by the fairies. This is 
open't. What's within, boy?

Clown:
You're old man: if the sins of 
are forgiven you, you're well live. Gold! all 


This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up 
with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
boy, the next way home. 
 
Clown:
Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
it.

Shepherd:
That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
sight him. 
 
Clown:
Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.

Shepherd:
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.

Time:
I, that please try both joy and terror 
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
To use my wings. Impute a crime 
To me my swift passage, that I 
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
Of that wide gap, since is in my power 
To o'erthrow law and in one hour 
To and o'erwhelm custom. Let me 
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
Or what is now received: I witness to
The times that so shall I 
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
The of this present, as tale 
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing, 
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
As had between: Leontes leaving, 
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
Gentle spectators, that I now may be
fair Bohemia, and remember well, 
I mentioned a son o' king's, which Florizel 
I now name to you; and with speed so pace
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues 
I list not but let Time's news 
Be known when 'tis brought forth.
A shepherd's daughter,
And what to her adheres, which follows after,
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
If ever you have spent time ere now; 
If never, yet that Time himself doth say
earnestly you never 

POLIXENES:
I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
grant this. 
 
CAMILLO:
It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
think so, which is another spur to my departure.

POLIXENES: 
As thou lovest Camillo, wipe not out the rest of 
thy services by leaving me the need I have 
thee thine own made; not to 
have thee than thus to want thee: thou, having 
made businesses which none without thee can 
sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
them thyself or with thee the very 
services thou hast done; which if I not enough 
considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal 
country, Sicilia, prithee speak no whose very 
naming me with the remembrance that 
penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
my brother; whose loss his most precious queen 
are even now to be 
Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my 
son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue 
being gracious, than they are in losing them when
they have approved their virtues.

CAMILLO: 
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
have missingly noted, is of retired 
from court and is less frequent to his princely 
exercises than formerly he hath appeared. 
 
POLIXENES: 
I have considered so much, Camillo, with some 
care; so far that I have eyes my service which 
look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.
 
CAMILLO: 
I have heard, sir, such a man, hath 
of most rare note: the report her 
extended more than be thought to begin from such 

POLIXENES: 
That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I
fear, the angle plucks our thither. 
shalt us to the where we will, not 
appearing what we are, have some question with the 
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and 
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I willingly obey your command. 

POLIXENES:
My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.

AUTOLYCUS:
daffodils to peer, 
With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
Why, then comes the o' the year; 
For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
For a of ale is dish for king. 
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants, 
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay, 
Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
While we lie tumbling the hay. 
I have Prince and my time 
wore three-pile; but out of service: 
But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
The pale moon shines by night:
And I wander here and there, 
I then do most go right.
If tinkers may have leave to live,
And bear the sow-skin budget,
Then account well may, give, 
And in the stocks avouch it.
traffic is when look to 
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
drab I purchased this caparison, and revenue is 
the silly cheat. Gallows and are too 
on the highway: and hanging are to 
me: the life to come, sleep out the 
of it. A a prize! 
 
Clown:
Let me every 'leven wether tods; every tod 
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred

AUTOLYCUS:
 
Clown:
cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am 
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
her mistress of the feast, and lays it 
on. She hath me four and twenty nose-gays for 
the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good 
ones; but they are most of means but 
puritan amongst them, and he psalms to 
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I
beg; four prunes, and many of 
raisins o' the

O, me, help pluck but off these rags; and 
then, death, death!

Clown: 
soul! thou need of rags to lay 
on thee, rather than have these off.

AUTOLYCUS:
O sir, the loathsomeness of them me more 
than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
ones 
 
Clown:
Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
great matter.
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
me.

Clown: 
What, by a horseman, or a footman? 


A sweet a footman. 
 
Clown: 
Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
has left with thee: this be a horseman's coat, 
it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.

AUTOLYCUS: 
O, good sir, tenderly, O!

Clown:
Alas, poor soul!
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
shoulder-blade is out. 

Clown:
How now! canst stand?



Clown:
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,
unto whom was going; I shall there have money, or 
thing want: offer me no money, I pray you; 
that kills my heart.
 
Clown:
manner of fellow that robbed you? 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
troll-my-dames; I him a of the 
prince: I cannot tell, good for which of his 
virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.

Clown:
His you would say; virtue whipped 
out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
there; and yet it will no more but abide.
 

Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
settled only rogue: some call him Autolycus. 
 
Clown:
Out upon him! for my life, prig: he haunts 
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings. 

AUTOLYCUS:
Very sir; sir, he; that's that 
put me into this apparel.
 
Clown:
Not cowardly rogue all Bohemia: if you had 
but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.

AUTOLYCUS:
I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
false heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant 
him. 

Clown:
How do you now?

AUTOLYCUS: 
Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and
walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace
softly towards my kinsman's.

Clown:
Shall I bring thee on the way?
 
AUTOLYCUS:
No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.
 
Clown: 
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
sheep-shearing.
 
AUTOLYCUS:
Prosper sweet sir! 
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
not this another and the 
shearers prove sheep, let me unrolled and my name 
put in the book of virtue!
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
And merrily hent the stile-a:
A merry heart goes all the day,
Your sad tires in a mile-a.

FLORIZEL: 
These your unusual weeds to each part of you 
a life: no but Flora 
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
And the queen on't. 

PERDITA:
Sir, my gracious lord,
To chide at extremes it me: 
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
a swain's and poor lowly 
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
In every mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom, I should blush 
To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
To show myself a glass. 

FLORIZEL: 
I bless the 
When my good falcon made flight across 
Thy father's ground. 

PERDITA: 
Now Jove afford you cause! 
To me the forges your greatness 
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
To by some accident, 
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
How would to see his work so 
Vilely up? would he say? Or how 
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
The sternness of his presence?
 

Apprehend
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
Humbling their deities to love, have 
shapes of beasts upon them: 
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune 
A and bleated; and fire-robed god, 
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain, 
As I seem now. Their transformations 
Were never for of beauty rarer, 
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
not before mine honour, nor my lusts 
Burn hotter than my faith.
 
PERDITA:
O, but, sir,
Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
One of these two must be necessities, 
Which then will speak, that you must
change this purpose, 
my life. 
 
FLORIZEL:
Thou dearest Perdita,
forced thoughts, I darken 
The mirth o' Or I'll be my fair, 
not my father's. For I cannot be 
Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
I be not thine. To this am most constant, 
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle; 
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
you behold the Your guests are coming: 
Lift your countenance, as were day 
Of celebration of that nuptial which
We two have sworn shall come.
 
PERDITA:
O lady Fortune, 
Stand you auspicious!

FLORIZEL:
See, your approach: 
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
And let's be red with mirth.

Shepherd: 
when my old wife upon 
This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
At end o' the table, now i' the middle; 
On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
would each one sip. are retired, 
As if you were a feasted one and not
The hostess the meeting: pray you, bid 
These unknown friends to's welcome; for is 
A way to make us better friends, more known.
Come, your and present yourself 
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
your good flock prosper. 

PERDITA:

POLIXENES:
Shepherdess,
A fair are you--well fit our 
With flowers of winter.


Sir, the year growing ancient,
Not on summer's death, nor on the birth 
Of trembling winter, the fairest
flowers the season 
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors, 
Which call bastards: of that kind 
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care 
To get slips of them. 

POLIXENES:
Wherefore, gentle maiden,
Do you neglect them? 
 
PERDITA: 
I have it said 
an art in piedness 
With great creating nature.

POLIXENES: 
Say there be;
Yet nature is made better by 
But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
you say adds to nature, 
That makes. You sweet maid, we marry 
A gentler to the wildest stock, 
And make conceive a of baser kind 
bud of race: is an art 
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
The art itself is nature. 

PERDITA: 
So it is. 
 
POLIXENES:
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
And do not call them bastards.
 
PERDITA: 
I'll not put 
The dibble to set one slip of them; 
more than were I painted I wish 
This should 'twere well and only therefore 
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Hot mints, marjoram; 
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
with him these are flowers 
middle summer, and they are given 
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.

CAMILLO: 
I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
only live by gazing. 
 
PERDITA:
Out, alas! 
You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
Would blow you through and through.
Now, fair'st friend, 
I had some flowers o' the that might 
Become your time day; and yours, 
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
For the that frighted thou let'st fall 
From Dis's waggon! daffodils, 
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The of March with beauty; violets 
But sweeter than of Juno's 
Cytherea's breath; pale 
That die unmarried, ere they can behold
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady 
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack, 
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
To strew him o'er and o'er!


What, a corse? 
 
PERDITA:
No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
But and in mine arms. your flowers: 
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition.
 
FLORIZEL: 
What you do 
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
I'ld you buy sell so alms, 
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
Nothing but that; move still, still so,
And own no other function: each your doing,
So singular in each particular,
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
That all your acts are queens.
 
PERDITA: 
O Doricles,
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd, 
With wisdom might fear, my 
You woo'd me the false way. 

FLORIZEL: 
I you have 
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
To put you to't. But our dance, I pray: 
Your Perdita: so turtles pair, 
That never mean to part.

PERDITA:
I'll for 'em. 

POLIXENES: 
is the prettiest ever 
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
But smacks of something than herself, 
Too for this place. 

CAMILLO: 
He tells her something
That makes her blood look good sooth, she is 
The queen of cream. 
 
Clown: 
Come on, strike up!


Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
To mend kissing with! 
 
MOPSA: 
Now, in 
 
Clown:
a word, a word; we stand upon our manners. 
Come, up! 
 
POLIXENES:
Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
Which dances with your daughter?
 
Shepherd: 
They call him and 
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
his own report and I believe it; 
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
I think so too; for never gazed the moon
as he'll and read 
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Who another best. 

POLIXENES: 
dances featly. 
 
Shepherd: 
So she does any though I report it, 
That should be silent: if young Doricles 
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
Which he not dreams of.
 
Servant:
master, if but hear the pedlar at the 
door, you would never dance again a tabour and 
pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he 
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's 
ears grew to his tunes.
 
Clown:
He could never come better; he shall come in. I
love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing 
indeed and sung lamentably.
 
Servant:
He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
bawdry, which is such delicate 
burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
as were, mischief and break a foul gap into 
the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.' 
 

This is a brave 
 
Clown: 
Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
Has he wares? 
 
Servant:
He hath ribbons of an the rainbow; 
points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; 
would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
to sleeve-hand and the work about the on't. 

Clown:
Prithee bring in; and let him approach 

PERDITA:
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.

Clown:
You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
than you'ld think, sister.
 
PERDITA:
Ay, good brother, or go about to think.

AUTOLYCUS: 
Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
faces and for noses; 
bracelet, necklace amber, 
Perfume for a lady's chamber;
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For lads to give their dears: 
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
What maids lack head heel: 
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
Buy lads, or else lasses Come buy. 

Clown:
If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
no money being I it 
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves. 

MOPSA:
I was promised them against the feast; but they come
not too late now.
 
DORCAS: 
He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.
 
MOPSA: 
He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.

Clown: 
Is there manners among maids? will 
wear their plackets where they their 
faces? Is there not when you are 
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
your tongues, not a 
 
MOPSA: 
I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
and a pair of sweet 
 
Clown:
I not thee how I cozened the way 
and lost all my money? 

AUTOLYCUS: 
indeed, there are cozeners abroad; 
therefore it behoves men to be wary.

Clown:
Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here. 

AUTOLYCUS: 
I hope so, sir; for about me many parcels of 
 

What hast here? ballads?
 
MOPSA: 
Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
life, for then we are sure they are true.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's one a very doleful tune, how a usurer's 
wife brought to bed of money-bags at a 
and how she longed adders' heads and 
carbonadoed. 
 
MOPSA:
Is it true, think you?
 

Very true, and but a month old.
 
DORCAS:
Bless me from marrying a usurer!
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
present. Why should I carry lies abroad?

MOPSA:
Pray you now, buy it.
 
Clown: 
Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
the other anon. 

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
against the hard hearts of it was 
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.
 
DORCAS:
Is it true too, think you?

AUTOLYCUS: 
Five justices' hands witnesses more than 
my pack will hold.

Clown:
Lay by 
 

This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.


Let's have some merry ones. 
 
AUTOLYCUS:
Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in 
request, I can tell you. 

MOPSA: 
can both it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou 
shalt hear; 'tis parts. 

DORCAS: 
We had the tune on't a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS: 
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
have at you. 

AUTOLYCUS: 
Get you hence, for I must go
Where it fits not you to know.

DORCAS: 
Whither? 


O, whither?

DORCAS:
Whither?
 
MOPSA:
It becomes thy oath full well,
Thou to me thy secrets tell.
 
DORCAS:
Me too, let me go thither. 

MOPSA: 
Or thou to or mill. 
 
DORCAS: 
If to either, thou ill. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
Neither. 
 
DORCAS: 
What, neither?

AUTOLYCUS: 
Neither. 

DORCAS: 
Thou hast sworn my love to be. 

MOPSA:
Thou hast sworn it more to me:
Then whither goest? say, whither? 


We'll have this song out anon my 
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
me. Wenches, you both. Pedlar, let's 
have first me, 
 

shall pay well for 'em. 
Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for your 
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your head,
Of the new'st and finest, 
Come to the pedlar;
Money's a medler.
That utter all men's ware-a. 

Servant:
Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, 
themselves all of they call 
Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches 
say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it
be not too rough for some know little 
bowling, it will please 
 
Shepherd:
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.
 
POLIXENES:
You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
these four threes of herdsmen.


One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath
danced before the king; and not the worst of the
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.

Shepherd: 
Leave your prating: since these good men are
pleased, let them come in; quickly now. 
 
Servant:
Why, stay at door, sir. 
 

O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
He's simple and tells much. 
How now, fair shepherd!
Your heart is full of something that does take
Your from feasting. when I young 
And handed love as you do, I was wont
To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
To her acceptance; you have let him go
And nothing marted with him. If your lass 
Interpretation should abuse call this 
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
For a reply, at least if you make care 
Of happy holding 

FLORIZEL:
Old I know 
She prizes such trifles as these are: 
The she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd 
Up my heart; which I have already, 
But not deliver'd. O, hear breathe my life 
ancient sir, who, it should seem, 
Hath sometime loved! take thy hand, this hand, 
As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd 
snow that's bolted 
By the northern blasts twice o'er.

POLIXENES:
What follows this?
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
to your let me hear 
What you profess.
 
FLORIZEL: 
Do, and be witness to 't.
 
POLIXENES:
And this my neighbour too?

FLORIZEL: 
And he, and more
Than he, and the earth, the heavens, all: 
That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
Thereof worthy, the fairest youth 
That ever made eye swerve, had force and 
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
her love; for her them all; 
Commend them and condemn to her service 
Or to their own perdition.

POLIXENES:
Fairly offer'd.
 
CAMILLO: 
This a affection. 

Shepherd: 
But, my daughter, 
Say you to 

PERDITA: 
I cannot speak 
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
By the pattern of mine own thoughts cut out 
The purity of his.

Shepherd:
Take hands, a bargain!
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
I give my daughter to him, and will make 
Her portion equal his.

FLORIZEL: 
O, that must 
I' the virtue of your one being dead, 
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for your wonder. come on, 
Contract us 'fore these witnesses. 

Shepherd: 
Come, your hand;
And, daughter, yours. 
 
POLIXENES: 
Soft, swain, awhile, beseech 
Have you a father?
 
FLORIZEL: 
I what of him? 

POLIXENES:
Knows he of this?

FLORIZEL: 
He neither does nor shall. 

POLIXENES:
Methinks a father
Is at the nuptial of his a guest 
That best becomes the Pray you once more, 
your grown 
Of is 
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear? 
Know from man? dispute his own estate? 
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
what he did being childish? 

FLORIZEL:
No, good sir;
He has his health and ampler strength indeed
Than most have of his age.
 
POLIXENES: 
By my white 
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
Something unfilial: reason my son
Should choose himself wife, but as good reason 
The father, whose joy is else 
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
such business. 

FLORIZEL: 
I yield 
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
Which not fit you know, I acquaint 
My father of this 
 
POLIXENES:
Let him know't. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
He shall 
 
POLIXENES:
Prithee, him. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
No, he not. 

Shepherd:
Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
At knowing of thy choice.
 
FLORIZEL:
Come, come, he must not.
Mark our contract.
 
POLIXENES: 
Mark your divorce, young sir,
Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir, 
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
I am that hanging thee I can 
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece 
Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
The royal fool thou copest with,--

Shepherd: 
O, my heart! 

POLIXENES: 
have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and 
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
thou no more shalt as never 
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
enough a herdsman: yea, him too, 
That makes himself, for our honour therein, 
Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
latches to his entrance open, 
Or hoop his body more embraces, 
I will a death as cruel for 
As thou art tender to't. 

PERDITA: 
Even here undone! 
was not much afeard; once twice 
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
The that shines upon his 
Hides not from cottage 
Looks on alike. please you, sir, gone? 
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther, 
But milk my ewes and weep.

CAMILLO:
Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou diest.
 
Shepherd: 
I nor think 
Nor to know that which I know. 
You have undone a man of fourscore three,
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
upon the bed my died, 
To lie close by his honest bones: but now
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me 
Where priest shovels in O cursed wretch, 
this was prince, 
and wouldst adventure
To mingle faith with him! Undone! 
If I might die within this hour, I have lived
To die when I desire.
 
FLORIZEL: 
Why look you so upon me?
I am but sorry, not delay'd, 
But nothing I I am; 
More straining on for back, following 
My unwillingly. 

CAMILLO: 
Gracious my lord,
your temper: at this time 
He will allow no speech, which I do guess
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
till fury of highness 
before him. 
 

I not purpose 
I think, Camillo?
 
CAMILLO:
Even my lord. 

PERDITA: 
How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
How often said, my dignity would last
But till 'twere known!
 
FLORIZEL: 
It cannot fail but by
The violation of my and then 
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
From my succession me, father; I 
heir to my affection. 

CAMILLO: 
Be 

FLORIZEL: 
I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
Will be obedient, I have reason; 
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
Do it welcome. 

CAMILLO:
This sir. 

FLORIZEL:
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
for Bohemia, that may 
Be thereat glean'd, all the sun sees 
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
To my fair beloved: therefore, pray you, 
As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, mean not 
To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
for the time come. This may know 
And so deliver, I am put to sea
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
And most opportune to our need I have
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
For this design. What course I mean to hold
nothing your knowledge, 
Concern me the reporting.
 
CAMILLO:
O my lord! 
I would your spirit were easier for advice, 
Or stronger for your need.

FLORIZEL:
Hark, Perdita
I'll and by. 
 
CAMILLO:
He's irremoveable,
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
His going I could frame to serve my turn,
him from danger, do him and honour, 
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy king, my master, whom
I thirst see. 

FLORIZEL:
Now, good Camillo;
I am so with curious business 
I leave out ceremony. 
 
CAMILLO: 
Sir, I think
have of my poor services, i' the love 
That I have borne your father?
 
FLORIZEL: 
nobly 
Have you deserved: it is my father's 
To speak your deeds, not little of his care
To have them recompensed as thought on.
 
CAMILLO:
lord, 
If you to think I love the king 
And through him what is nearest to him, which is
Your self, embrace but my direction: 
If your more ponderous and settled project 
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
As shall become your highness; where you 
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
And bring him up to liking.
 
FLORIZEL: 
How, Camillo, 
May this, almost a miracle, be done?
I may call something man 
And after that trust to thee.

CAMILLO:
you thought on 
place you'll 

FLORIZEL:
Not any yet:
But as the unthought-on is 
To what we do, so we profess 
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blows.


Then list to me:
follows, if will not change purpose 
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
And there present yourself and 
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
She shall be habited as it becomes
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
'twere i' father's kisses hands 
Of your princess; o'er and o'er divides him 
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or time.

FLORIZEL:
Worthy Camillo, 
What colour for my visitation shall I
Hold up before him?

CAMILLO:
Sent by the king your father 
To him and to give him comforts. Sir, 
The manner of your bearing towards him, with
What you as from your father shall deliver, 
Things known betwixt us three, I'll 
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
say; that he shall not perceive 
But that you have your father's bosom there 
And speak his very heart.

FLORIZEL: 
I am bound to you:
There is some sap in this.

CAMILLO:
A cause more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
But as you shake off one to take another;
Nothing so as your anchors, who 
Do their best if they can but stay you 
Where you'll be to be: besides you 
Prosperity's the very bond of love,
Whose fresh complexion whose heart together 
Affliction alters. 
 
PERDITA:
One of these is true:
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
But not take in the mind.

CAMILLO:
Yea, say you so? 
There shall not at your father's house these
years 
Be born another such.
 
FLORIZEL:
My good 
She is as forward of her breeding as 
She is i' the rear our birth.
 
CAMILLO: 
I cannot say 'tis pity 
She lacks for she seems a mistress 
To most that 

PERDITA:
Your pardon, sir; for this
I'll blush you 
 
FLORIZEL:
My prettiest Perdita!
But O, the stand 
Preserver of my father, now of me, 
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son, 
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
 
CAMILLO: 
My lord, 
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
Do all lie it shall my care 
To you royally appointed as 
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
you may know you shall not want, one word. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
Ha, a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his 
sworn very simple gentleman! I have sold 
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, a 
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, 
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
should buy first, as if my trinkets been 
hallowed and brought a to the buyer: 
by means saw whose purse was best in 
picture; and what I saw, to my good use I
remembered. My who but something 
be a reasonable man, grew so in love the 
wenches' song, he would not 
till he had both tune words; which so drew the 
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
in have pinched a placket, it 
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song, 
and admiring nothing of it. So that in 
time of I picked and cut most of their 
festival purses; and not the old man come in 
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
and scared my choughs from the I had not 
left a purse alive in the whole army.
 
CAMILLO:
Nay, but my letters, this means being 
So soon you arrive, shall clear that doubt. 
 
FLORIZEL: 
And those that you'll procure from King Leontes-- 
 
CAMILLO:
Shall satisfy your father.
 
PERDITA: 
Happy be you!
All that you speak shows fair.
 
CAMILLO: 
Who have we here?
We'll make an instrument of this, omit 
us aid. 

AUTOLYCUS:
If they have overheard me hanging. 

CAMILLO: 
How now, good fellow! why thou so? 
not, man; here's no harm intended to thee. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
I am a poor fellow, sir.

CAMILLO: 
Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
thee: yet for the outside of poverty we must 
make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,
--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and
change garments with this gentleman: though the
pennyworth on side be the thee, 
there's some boot. 


I am a poor fellow, sir.
I know ye enough. 

CAMILLO:
Nay, the gentleman is half 
flayed already.

AUTOLYCUS: 
Are you in earnest, sir?
I smell the trick on't.

FLORIZEL: 
Dispatch, I prithee.

AUTOLYCUS: 
Indeed, I have had earnest: but cannot 
conscience take it.
 
CAMILLO:
Unbuckle, 
Fortunate prophecy 
Come home to must retire yourself 
Into covert: hat 
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face, 
you, and, as disliken 
The truth of your own seeming; you may-- 
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescried. 
 
PERDITA:
I see the play so lies
That I bear a part. 

CAMILLO: 
remedy. 
Have you done there?

FLORIZEL: 
Should I now meet my father,
He would not call me son. 

CAMILLO:
Nay, you shall have no 
come. Farewell, my 
 
AUTOLYCUS:
Adieu, sir.

FLORIZEL: 
O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
Pray you, a word.
 
CAMILLO:
 
FLORIZEL:
Fortune speed 
we on, to 

CAMILLO:
The swifter speed the better.
 
AUTOLYCUS:
I understand the hear it: to have an 
ear, a quick eye, and a nimble is 
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
What an exchange had this been without boot! What
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
this year connive at us, and we may any thing 
extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
iniquity, stealing away from his with his 
clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
and therein am I constant to profession. 
Aside, aside; here is more hot brain: 
every lane's end, every shop, church, session, 
hanging, yields a careful man work.
 
Clown: 
See, see; what a man you are now!
There is no other way but to king 
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.
 
Shepherd:
Nay, but hear me.

Clown:
Nay, but hear me.

Shepherd: 
Go to, then.


She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
and blood has not the king; your 
flesh and blood is not to be punished him. Show 
those things you found about her, those secret
things, all but what she has with her: this being
done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.

Shepherd:
tell the king all, every word, and his 
son's pranks too; I may say, is no honest man, 
neither to his father nor to to go about to 
me the king's brother-in-law.

Clown: 
Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
could have been to him and then your blood had been
the dearer by I know how much an ounce.

AUTOLYCUS:
 
Shepherd:
Well, let us to the king: there is that in this
fardel will make him scratch his beard.
 
AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Pray heartily he be at palace. 

AUTOLYCUS: 

Shepherd: 
To the palace, an it like your worship. 

AUTOLYCUS:
Your affairs there, with whom, the 
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
thing that is fitting to be known, discover.

Clown: 
We but plain sir. 

AUTOLYCUS:
A lie; you are rough and Let me no 
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
they do not give us the lie.

Clown: 
Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
had not with the 

Shepherd: 
Are you a courtier, sir? 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
not air of the court in these enfoldings? 
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on court-contempt? Thinkest thou, 
that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy 
business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to 
open thy affair.
 

My business, sir, is to the king.

AUTOLYCUS:
What advocate hast thou to him?

Shepherd: 
I know not, an't like you. 

Clown:
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
have none. 
 
Shepherd:
None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
How blessed are we that are not simple men!
Yet nature might have made me these are, 
Therefore I not disdain. 


This cannot be but a great courtier.
 
Shepherd: 
His garments are rich, but he wears
them handsomely. 

Clown:
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking
on's teeth.
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
Wherefore that box?

Shepherd: 
Sir, there lies such secrets this fardel and box, 
which none must know but king; and he 
shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
speech of him.
 
AUTOLYCUS:
Age, thou hast lost thy labour. 

Shepherd:
Why, 

AUTOLYCUS:
The king is not the palace; is gone a 
new ship purge melancholy and himself: for, 
thou beest of things must 
know the king is full of grief. 
 
Shepard: 
So 'tis sir; about his son, that should have 
married a daughter. 
 
AUTOLYCUS:
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
the he shall have, the tortures he 
feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.

Clown:
Think you so, sir? 
 
AUTOLYCUS:
he alone shall suffer what can make heavy 
and vengeance those that are germane to 
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
the hangman: which though great pity, 
yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
is too soft him, I draw our throne into a 
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the too 
 
Clown: 
Has the e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't 
like sir? 

AUTOLYCUS:
He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
wasp's nest; then stand till be three quarters 
and a dram dead; then recovered again with
aqua-vitae or some other infusion; as 
he is, and in prognostication 
shall be be a brick-wall, the 
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where 
is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
are to smiled at, their offences being so 
capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
men, what you have to the king: being something
gently I'll you he 
aboard, tender your persons to his presence,
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
besides the to effect your suits, here man 
shall do 

Clown: 
He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn
bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
the inside of your purse to the outside of his 
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

Shepherd:
An't please sir, to undertake the for 
us, here is that gold I'll make it as much 
more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
After I have done what 
 
Shepherd: 
sir. 
 
AUTOLYCUS:
Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?

Clown:
In some sort, sir: but though my pitiful 
one, I I shall not be flayed out of it. 

AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
he'll be made an example.

Clown: 
Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show 
our strange sights: he know 'tis none of your 
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
will give you as much as this old man does when the
business is performed, and as says, your 
pawn till it be brought you.
 
AUTOLYCUS:
I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
go on right hand: I will but upon 
hedge and follow you. 


We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.

Shepherd: 
Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.

AUTOLYCUS:
If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am 
courted with a occasion, gold and a means 
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
think fit to them again and that the 
complaint they have to the king concerns him
nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
officious; for I am proof against that title and
what shame else belongs to't. To will I present 
them: there may be matter in it.
 
CLEOMENES: 
Sir, you enough, and have 
saint-like sorrow: fault could you 
Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
Do the heavens have done, forget your 
With them forgive yourself.
 
LEONTES:
Whilst I remember 
and her virtues, I cannot forget 
blemishes in them, and so still think of 
The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
Bred his hopes out of.
 
PAULINA: 
too lord: 
one by one, you wedded all the 
Or from the all that are took something good,
To make a perfect woman, she kill'd 
Would be unparallel'd. 
 
LEONTES: 
I think so. Kill'd!
She I kill'd! so: but thou me 
Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
Say so but 

CLEOMENES:
Not at all, good lady:
You have a things would 
Have time benefit and 
Your kindness 

PAULINA:
You are of 
Would have him wed again.
 
DION:
you so, 
You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
Of his most sovereign name; consider little
What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
May drop upon his kingdom and devour
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy 
to the former queen well? 
What holier than, for royalty's repair,
For present comfort and for future good,
To bless the bed of majesty again
With a sweet fellow to't?
 
PAULINA:
There is none worthy, 
Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes; 
For the divine Apollo said, 
not the tenor 
That King shall not have an 
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall, 
Is all as monstrous to our reason 
my Antigonus to his 
And come again to me; who, on my life,
Did with the infant. 'Tis your counsel 
My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
Oppose against their wills.
Care not for issue; 
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
Was like to be the best.

LEONTES:
Good Paulina,
Who hast the memory of Hermione,
I know, in honour, O, that ever I
Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes, 
Have taken from her lips-- 
 
PAULINA: 
left them 
More rich what they yielded. 
 
LEONTES:
Thou truth. 
No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
And better used, her sainted 
Again possess corpse, and on this stage, 
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And 'Why to 

PAULINA:
Had such power, 
She had just cause.

LEONTES:
She had; would incense 
murder her I married. 

PAULINA: 
I should 
Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
Her eye, and me for dull part 
You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
Should be 'Remember mine.'

LEONTES: 
Stars, stars,
And eyes dead Fear thou no wife; 
I'll have no wife, Paulina. 
 
PAULINA:
Will you swear
Never to but by my free leave? 
 

so be my spirit! 

PAULINA: 
Then, good my lords, bear to his oath. 
 
CLEOMENES:
You tempt over-much. 

PAULINA:
another, 
As like as is her picture, 
Affront his eye.

CLEOMENES: 
madam,-- 

PAULINA: 
I have done.
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you sir, 
No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young 
As was your former; but she shall be such
As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
it should take joy
To see her in arms. 
 

My true Paulina,
We shall not marry bid'st 

PAULINA:
That 
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
Never till then.

Gentleman:
that gives out himself Prince 
of with his princess, 
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
To your high presence.

LEONTES:
What with him? he comes not 
Like to his father's greatness: approach, 
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
'Tis not a visitation but forced 
By and accident. What train? 

Gentleman:
But 
And those but mean.
 
LEONTES:
His princess, say you, with him?

Gentleman: 
the most peerless piece of I 
That e'er the sun shone bright on.

PAULINA:
O Hermione, 
As every present time boast 
Above a better gone, so must thy grave
way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself 
Have said and writ so, but your writing now
Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd, 
To say you have seen a better.

Gentleman:
madam: 
The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,-- 
The other, when she has your eye, 
have your too. This is a creature, 
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
Of all professors else, make proselytes
Of she bid follow. 

PAULINA:
How! not women? 
 
Gentleman: 
Women love her, that is a 
More worth man; that 
The rarest of all women. 
 
LEONTES: 
Go, Cleomenes; 
Yourself, assisted with honour'd friends, 
Bring them to our embracement. 'tis strange 
He thus should steal upon us. 
 
PAULINA: 
Had our prince,
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
Well with this lord: there was not full a month
Between their births.

LEONTES:
Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st 
He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
Will bring me to consider that which 
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
Your mother was most true wedlock, 
For she did print father 
Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
Your father's image is so hit in you,
His very air, that I should call you brother,
As I did him, and speak of something wildly
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas! 
I couple, that 'twixt and earth 
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as 
You, gracious couple, and then I lost-- 
All mine own folly--the society,
of brave father, whom, 
Though bearing I desire 
Once more to look on him.

FLORIZEL:
By command 
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
Can send his brother: and, infirmity 
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
wish'd ability, he had himself 
lands waters 'twixt your and his 
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
bade me say so--more than all the sceptres 
And those that bear 

LEONTES: 
O my 
Good the have done thee stir 
Afresh within me, and these thy 
So rarely kind, are as interpreters 
Of my behind-hand slackness. hither, 
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
this to the fearful usage, 
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune, 
To greet a man not her much less 
The her person? 

FLORIZEL:
Good my 
She came from 

LEONTES: 
Where the warlike Smalus,
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?

FLORIZEL:
royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter 
His proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence, 
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
To execute the charge father gave 
For visiting highness: best 
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
Who for Bohemia to signify 
Not only my Libya, sir, 
But and my wife's in 
Here are. 

LEONTES: 
The blessed gods
Purge all infection our air whilst you 
Do here! You have a father, 
A graceful gentleman; against 
So as it is, done sin: 
For which the heavens, taking angry note,
Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
As he from heaven merits it, with you
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
Such goodly as you! 


Most noble sir,
That which I shall report will bear no credit,
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir, 
Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
Desires you to attach his son, who has-- 
His dignity and duty both cast off-- 
Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
A shepherd's daughter. 
 

Where's Bohemia? speak. 

Lord: 
Here in your city; I now came from him:
speak amazedly; and it 
My marvel and my To your court 
Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, 
this couple, he the way 
The father of this seeming lady and
Her brother, having both their quitted 
With this young prince.

FLORIZEL: 
Camillo has betray'd 
Whose honour and whose honesty till now
Endured all weathers.
 
Lord: 
Lay't so to his charge:
He's with father. 
 
LEONTES:
Who? Camillo? 
 
Lord:
Camillo, sir; spake with him; who now 
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
Wretches so quake: kneel, they kiss earth; 
Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them 
divers in death. 
 
PERDITA: 
O my poor father! 
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
Our contract celebrated.


You are married?
 

We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
odds for high low's 
 
LEONTES: 
My lord, 
Is this the daughter of a king? 
 
FLORIZEL:
She is, 
When once she is my wife.

LEONTES: 
That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
Where you tied in duty, as sorry 
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
That you might well enjoy 
 
FLORIZEL: 
Dear, look up:
Though Fortune, visible an enemy, 
Should chase us with my father, power no jot
Hath she change our loves. Beseech you, sir, 
Remember since you owed no more to time
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
Step at your request 
My father will things as 
 
LEONTES: 
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
Which he counts but trifle. 

PAULINA: 
Sir, liege, 
Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
Than what you look on now.
 
LEONTES: 
I thought of her,
Even in these looks I made.
But your petition
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
I am friend to them and you: which errand 
I now go toward him; therefore follow me
what way I come, my lord. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
Beseech you, were you present at this relation? 

First Gentleman:
I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
commanded of the chamber; this methought I 
heard the shepherd say, he found the child.
 
AUTOLYCUS:
I most gladly know the of 

First Gentleman:
I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
changes perceived in the king Camillo 
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
eyes; speech in their dumbness, language 
in their as they had 
of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest 
beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
say if the importance joy or sorrow; but in the 
extremity of one, it must needs 
Here a gentleman that haply knows more. 
The news, 
 
Second 
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder 
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
cannot be able to express it.
Here comes Lady Paulina's steward: he can 
deliver you more. How goes it now, this 
which called true like tale, that 
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king 
found his heir? 
 
Third Gentleman: 
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
know to be his character, the majesty of the
creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
and many other evidences proclaim her with all
certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
the meeting of the two kings?

Second Gentleman:
No.
 
Third Gentleman:
Then have you lost a sight, which was to be 
cannot spoken of. There you have beheld one 
joy crown another, so and in such manner that 
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
joy waded in tears. There was up of 
holding up of countenances of such 
distraction that they were to be known by garment,
not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
joy were now become a loss, cries thy mother, 
thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
embraces his 
daughter with her; he thanks the old 
shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
encounter, which report follow it 
and undoes description to do it.

Gentleman: 
What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
hence the 
 
Third 
Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
rehearse, though be asleep and not an ear 
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
avouches shepherd's son; who has not only his 
innocence, which seems much, to him, but a 
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
 
First Gentleman:
What became of his bark and his followers?

Third Gentleman: 
Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
instruments which aided expose child were 
even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
her to she might no be in danger 
of losing.

First 
The dignity this was worth the audience of 
kings and princes; for by such it acted. 

Third Gentleman:
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
for caught the water though 
the fish, was when, at the of the queen's 
death, with the manner how she came to't 
confessed and lamented by the king, how
wounded his daughter; from 
sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
heart wept blood. Who was marble there changed 
colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.

Gentleman: 
they returned the 

Third Gentleman: 
No: the princess hearing her mother's statue, 
which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
years in doing and now newly performed by that 
Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
and could put breath into his work, would 
beguile her custom, so perfectly he is her 
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
they say would speak to her and stand in hope of 
answer: thither with all greediness of affection 
are they gone, and there they intend to sup.

Second Gentleman: 
I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
since the of Hermione, visited that 
house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
the rejoicing?
 
First Gentleman: 
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
every wink an eye some grace will born: 
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
Let's along. 
 
AUTOLYCUS: 
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
at that time, overfond the daughter, 
so he took her to be, who to be 
sea-sick, and little better, of 
weather continuing, this mystery remained
undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
been the finder out of this it 
have relished among my other discredits. 
Here come those I have done good to against my will,
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.

Shepherd: 
Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and
daughters will be all gentlemen born. 

Clown:
You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
See you these clothes? say you see them not and
me still no gentleman you were say 
these robes are gentlemen born: give me the 
lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.
 
AUTOLYCUS:
I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

Clown: 
Ay, and have been so any time these four hours. 

Shepherd: 
And so have I, boy.
 
Clown: 
So you but I was a gentleman born before my 
father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
called me and then the two kings 
father brother; and then the prince my brother and
the princess my sister called my father father; and
so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
tears that ever we shed.

Shepherd:
We may live, son, to shed many more.


Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
preposterous estate as we are.

AUTOLYCUS: 
I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
faults I your worship and to give 
your good report to the prince my master. 

Shepherd:
Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are
gentlemen.
 
Clown:
wilt amend thy life? 

AUTOLYCUS:
Ay, an it like your good worship.
 
Clown: 
Give me hand: I will to the prince thou 
art as honest true as any in Bohemia. 

Shepherd: 
You may say it, but not swear 


Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
franklins it, I'll swear it. 

Shepherd: 
How if it be false, son? 

Clown:
it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman swear 
it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou 
be a tall fellow of thy hands.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will so, sir, to my power. 
 
Clown: 
Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
queen's picture. Come, follow us: be 
good 


O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
That I have had of thee!

PAULINA:
What, sovereign sir, 
I did well I my services 
You have home: but that you have 
With crown'd brother and these your contracted 
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
It is a surplus of your grace, which never
My life may last to answer. 
 
LEONTES: 
O Paulina, 
We honour you with trouble: but we came 
To see statue of our queen: your gallery 
Have we pass'd through, not without much content 
In many singularities; but we saw not
That which my daughter came to look upon, 
of her mother. 

PAULINA:
As she lived peerless, 
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
sleep mock'd death: behold, say 'tis well. 
I like your silence, it the more shows off 
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
Comes it not something 
 

Her posture! 
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
Thou Hermione; or thou art she 
In thy not chiding, for she was as 
As infancy grace. But yet, Paulina, 
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this seems. 

POLIXENES:
O, not by much.

PAULINA: 
So much the more our carver's excellence;
go by sixteen years and makes her 
As she lived now. 
 
LEONTES:
As now she might have done, 
So much to my good comfort, as it is
Now to my soul. O, thus she stood, 
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
As now coldly stands, when first I woo'd her! 
I am ashamed: does not the stone 
For being more stone royal piece, 
There's magic in thy majesty, which has
evils conjured to remembrance and 
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
Standing like with thee. 

PERDITA: 
And give me leave,
And do not say 'tis that 
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
Dear queen, that ended when I but began, 
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

PAULINA:
O, 
statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's dry. 
 
CAMILLO:
My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on, 
winters blow away, 
So many summers dry; scarce any joy
Did ever so long live; no sorrow
But kill'd itself much sooner. 
 
POLIXENES:
Dear my 
Let him was the cause of this have power 
To take off so much from he 
piece up in himself. 
 
PAULINA: 
Indeed, my lord,
If I had thought the sight of my poor image
Would thus you,--for stone is mine-- 
I'ld not have show'd it.
 
LEONTES:
not draw the curtain. 

PAULINA:
longer you on't, lest your fancy 
May think anon it moves.
 
LEONTES:
Let be, let be.
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
What was did it? See, my 
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
Did verily bear blood?

POLIXENES: 
Masterly done: 
The very seems warm upon her lip. 

LEONTES:
The fixture her eye has motion in't, 
As we are with 
 
PAULINA:
I'll draw the curtain:
lord's almost far transported that 
He'll think anon it lives. 
 
LEONTES:
O sweet Paulina,
Make me to think so twenty years together! 
No settled senses of the world can match
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
 
PAULINA: 
am sir, have thus far stirr'd you: 
I could afflict you farther.

LEONTES:
Do, Paulina;
For this affliction has a taste as sweet 
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
There an air comes her: what chisel 
Could ever cut breath? Let no man mock me, 
For I will kiss her.
 
PAULINA: 
Good my lord, forbear: 
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

LEONTES: 
No, not these twenty years.

PERDITA:
So long could I 
Stand by, a looker on.
 
PAULINA:
Either forbear, 
Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you 
For more amazement. If you can behold it,
I'll make statue move indeed, 
And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
Which I protest against--I am assisted
By wicked powers.
 
LEONTES:
What you can make her do,
I am to look on: what to 
I am content for 'tis as easy 
her speak as 

PAULINA:
It is 
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
On: those that think it is unlawful business
am about, them depart. 
 
LEONTES:
Proceed: 
foot stir. 


Music, 
'Tis time; descend; be stone more; approach; 
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
Bequeath to death your numbness, for him 
Dear life redeems You stirs: 
Start not; her actions shall be as 
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
Until you see for then 
her double. Nay, present your hand: 
When you woo'd her; age 
Is she become the suitor? 

LEONTES: 
she's 
this be it 
Lawful as eating. 

POLIXENES: 
She embraces him.
 
CAMILLO: 
hangs about his neck: 
If she pertain to life let her speak too.
 
POLIXENES: 
Ay, make't manifest where has lived, 
Or stolen from the dead. 

PAULINA:
That she is living, 
Were it but told you, should at 
Like an old tale: but appears lives, 
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
Please to interpose, fair madam: kneel 
And your mother's blessing. good lady; 
Our Perdita is 

HERMIONE: 
You gods, look down
And from your sacred vials pour your graces
Upon my daughter's head! Tell own. 
Where hast thou been preserved? lived? how found 
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Gave hope thou wast in have preserved 
Myself to see the issue. 
 
PAULINA:
There's time enough for that;
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Your joys with like relation. Go together, 
precious winners all; your 
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
My mate, that's never to be again, 
Lament till I am lost. 


O, peace, Paulina! 
Thou shouldst a take by my consent, 
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her, 
As I thought, dead, have in vain said many 
A prayer upon her grave. I'll seek far-- 
him, partly know his mind--to 
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo, 
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
Is noted and here justified 
By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
What! look upon my brother: your pardons, 
That e'er I put between your holy looks
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law, 
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
Is troth-plight to your Paulina, 
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
Each one demand an answer to his part
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
away. 
 
VINCENTIO: 
Escalus. 
 
ESCALUS:
My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government the to unfold, 
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Since I am put to know that your 
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you: then no more remains,
But that to sufficiency, your Worth able, 
And let them work. The nature of our people,
city's institutions, the terms 
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
As art and practise hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have warp. Call hither, 
I say, bid come before us 
figure of us think you he bear? 
For you must know, we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply,
Lent him our terror, dress'd with 
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power: what think you of it?

ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna be of worth
To such ample and honour, 
is Angelo. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
Always obedient to your grace's 
I come to know your pleasure. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life,
That to observer thy history 
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy 
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon virtues, they on 
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do, 
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence 
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo:--
In our be thou at ourself; 
and Vienna 
Live thy tongue and old Escalus, 
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission. 

ANGELO:
Now, my lord, 
Let there be some made of my metal, 
Before so noble and so a figure 
stamp'd upon it. 

VINCENTIO: 
No more evasion: 
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition 
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you, 
As time and our concernings shall importune, 
goes with us, and do look to know 
What doth befall here. So, fare you 
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions. 
 
ANGELO:
Yet give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws 
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
I'll privily love the people, 
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
Through it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and vehement; 
Nor do think the man 
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

ANGELO:
The heavens give safety to your purposes!
 
ESCALUS: 
Lead bring you back in happiness! 

DUKE: 
I thank you. Fare you well.

ESCALUS: 
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and concerns 
To into the of my place: 
A power I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not 

ANGELO: 
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
And may soon 
Touching that point.

ESCALUS: 
I'll wait upon your honour.

Amen.

went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
one out of the table.

Second Gentleman:
'Thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO: 
Ay, that he razed. 
 
First Gentleman:
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and

I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
feeling of thy I of thine own 
confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
live, forget to drink after thee.

First Gentleman: 
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not? 

Second Gentleman:
Yes, that thou thou art tainted or free. 
 
LUCIO: 
Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I

LUCIO:
Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as

How now! which of hips has the most profound sciatica?

Who's that, I pray thee?

MISTRESS OVERDONE: 
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

First Gentleman:
Claudio prison? 'tis not 
 
MISTRESS OVERDONE: 
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
him carried away; and, which is more, within these
three days his head to be chopped off.

LUCIO:
But, after all this fooling, I not so. 
Art thou sure of this?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
I am too sure of and it is for Madam 
Julietta with child.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But what's his offence? 


Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

MISTRESS OVERDONE: 
What, is there with child by him? 

POMPEY: 
No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
not heard of the proclamation, have you?
 
MISTRESS OVERDONE:

POMPEY: 
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
And what shall become of those in the city?

POMPEY:
They shall for they gone 
but that a wise burgher put in for them.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pulled down?


To the ground, mistress. 
 
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become me? 
 
POMPEY: 
fear you not: good counsellors lack no 
clients: though you change your place, you need not
your be your tapster still. 
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
have your eyes almost in the service, you 
will be considered.

OVERDONE: 
What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.


Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the to 
prison; and there's Madam 
 
CLAUDIO:
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

Provost: 
I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
 
CLAUDIO:
Thus can the demigod Authority 
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The heaven; on it will, it will; 
whom will not, so; yet still 'tis 

LUCIO: 
Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?
 
CLAUDIO: 
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
As surfeit is the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
to restraint. Our natures do pursue, 
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
thirsty evil; and when we drink we die. 

LUCIO:
If could so wisely an arrest, I would 
send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
What but to speak of would offend again.
 
LUCIO: 
What, is't murder?

CLAUDIO:
No.
 
LUCIO: 
Lechery? 

CLAUDIO:
Call so. 

Provost: 
Away, sir! you must go.


One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
 
LUCIO:
A hundred, if do any good. 
Is lechery so look'd after?

CLAUDIO: 
Thus stands it with upon a true 
I got possession of bed: 
You know the lady; she is fast my 
Save that we do the denunciation lack 
Of outward order: this we came not to, 
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining the coffer of friends, 
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love 
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet. 

LUCIO: 
child, 

CLAUDIO:
Unhappily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the duke--
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Or whether the body public be 
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, it may know 
He can command, lets it feel the 
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his emmence that fills it up,
I stagger in:--but this new governor 
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have round 
And none of them been and, for name, 
Now puts the and neglected act 
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
 
LUCIO: 
I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
thy shoulders a milkmaid, she be in love, 
may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
him.
 
CLAUDIO: 
I but to be 
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should the cloister enter
And her approbation: 
her with the danger of my 
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him: 
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There a prone and speechless dialect, 
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well she can persuade.

LUCIO: 
I she as well the encouragement the 
like, which else would stand under grievous
imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I 
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

CLAUDIO: 
I thank you, good friend Lucio.
 
LUCIO: 
Within two hours.
 
CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, away! 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
No, holy throw away that 
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends 
Of burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS:
May your grace speak of it?
 
DUKE 
My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have loved the removed 
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
man of stricture firm abstinence, 
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
so I have in common ear, 
it received. Now, pious sir, 
You will demand of me why I do this? 

FRIAR THOMAS: 
Gladly, my lord. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
We statutes and most biting laws. 
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
Which for this we have let slip; 
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Only to it in their children's sight 
terror, not to use, in time the 
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum. 
 
FRIAR THOMAS: 
It rested in your grace 
To unloose this tied-up you pleased: 
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
Than Lord Angelo. 

DUKE 
I do fear, too dreadful: 
'twas to give the people scope, 
'Twould be my tyranny strike gall them 
I them we bid this be done, 
When evil deeds have permissive 
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo imposed the 
Who may, in ambush of my name, strike home, 
And yet my nature never in the fight 
To do in slander. And to behold his sway, 
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order, 
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit instruct 
How may person me 
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you;
this one: Lord Angelo precise; 
Stands at a guard with envy; confesses 
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall see, 
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.
 

And have you nuns no farther privileges?

FRANCISCA:
not these enough? 

ISABELLA:
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

LUCIO:


Who's which calls? 

FRANCISCA:
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
You may, I are 
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
But in the presence of the prioress: 
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
He calls again; I pray you, answer him.

ISABELLA: 
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls 


Hail, if you be, those 
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?
 
ISABELLA: 
Why 'her unhappy let me ask, 
The rather for I now must make you know
I am that and his sister. 

LUCIO:
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
Not to be you, he's prison. 
 
ISABELLA:
for what? 
 
LUCIO: 
For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He receive his punishment in thanks: 
He hath got his friend with child.


make not your 

LUCIO:
It is 
I would not--though familiar sin 
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and 
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with sincerity, 
As with a saint.

ISABELLA:
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
 
LUCIO:
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Your brother and his lover have embraced:
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
That from the seedness bare fallow brings 
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full and 

ISABELLA: 
Some one with child by him? cousin 
 
LUCIO:
Is she cousin? 
 
ISABELLA:
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
By vain though apt affection.

LUCIO: 
She is. 

ISABELLA:
O, let him marry her.
 

is the point. 
The duke is very strangely gone hence; 
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one, 
In hand and hope but we do learn 
By those that know the very nerves of state,
His givings-out were of an infinite distance 
From his true-meant design. 
And with full line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood 
Is very one never 
The wanton stings motions of sense, 
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
He--to give fear to use and liberty,
Which have for long run by the law, 
As by lions--hath pick'd out an act, 
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And follows rigour of the 
To make him an All is 
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer 
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of 
'Twixt you and your poor brother. 
 
ISABELLA:
Doth he so seek his life? 

LUCIO:
Has censured him
and, as I the provost hath 
A warrant for his execution.
 

Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good?
 
LUCIO:
Assay the power you have. 

ISABELLA: 
My power? Alas, I doubt-- 
 
LUCIO: 
doubts are traitors 
And us lose the good we oft might win 
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men give gods; but when weep and 
All petitions are as theirs 
As they would owe them. 

ISABELLA:
I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO: 
But speedily.

ISABELLA:
I will about it straight;
No longer staying to give the mother 
my affair. I humbly thank you: 
Commend me to my brother: soon at 
send him certain word of success. 

LUCIO:
I take my leave of you.

ISABELLA:
Good sir, adieu.

ANGELO:
We must not make a scarecrow of the law, 
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
let it keep one till it 
Their and not their terror. 

ESCALUS: 
Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut little, 
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
Whom would save, had a most noble father! 
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue, 
That, in the working your own affections, 
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
Or that the acting of your blood 
Could attain'd the effect of your own purpose, 
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
And pull'd the law upon you.


'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I not deny,
The jury, passing the life, 
May in the sworn twelve thief or 
Guiltier him they What's open made to justice, 
That justice seizes: what know the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
we see it; what we do not see 
We tread upon, and never think of it. 
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine judgment out my 
And nothing come Sir, he must die. 

ESCALUS: 
Be it as your wisdom will. 
 

Where is the provost?
 
Provost:
Here, if it like your honour.

ANGELO: 
See that Claudio
Be executed to-morrow morning: 
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

ESCALUS:
 
ELBOW:
Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
common I know no law: bring away. 
 
ANGELO: 
How sir! What's your name? and what's the matter? 
 
ELBOW: 
If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
honour two notorious benefactors.
 
ANGELO:
Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
not malefactors? 
 
ELBOW: 
If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
but precise they that I am sure 
of; and void of all profanation in the world that
good Christians ought to have.

ESCALUS: 
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

ANGELO: 
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
name? dost not speak, Elbow? 


He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
 
ANGELO:
What are you, sir?
 
ELBOW: 
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS: 
How know you that?
 
ELBOW: 
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--

ESCALUS: 
thy wife? 

ELBOW:
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--

ESCALUS:
Dost thou detest her therefore?

ELBOW: 
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well 
she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
it is pity of her life, for it a naughty 

ESCALUS: 
How dost thou know constable? 

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
cardinally given, might have been accused in
fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
 
ESCALUS: 
the woman's means? 

ELBOW: 
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: as 
in face, so him. 

POMPEY: 
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.

ELBOW: 
Prove it before these here, thou honourable 
prove it. 

ESCALUS: 
Do you hear misplaces? 

POMPEY: 
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes; 
sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
dishes,-- 

ESCALUS:
Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.


No, indeed, sir, a pin; you are therein in 
the right: but to the point. As I say, this
Mistress Elbow, being, I say, child, 
being and I said, 
prunes; but two in the dish, I said, 
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
rest, as I and, as I say, paying for them very 
honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
not you again. 

FROTH: 
No, indeed.

POMPEY:
Very well: you if you be remembered, 
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,-- 
 
FROTH: 
Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY: 
very well; I telling you if you be 
that such a one and a one were past 
cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
good I told you,-- 

FROTH: 
All this is true. 

POMPEY:
Why, very well, then,--

ESCALUS: 
Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
of? me to what was done to her. 
 
POMPEY: 
Sir, your cannot come to that yet. 
 
ESCALUS:
No, I mean it not. 
 

but you to it, by your honour's 
leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
Master 
 
FROTH: 
All-hallond eve. 

POMPEY: 
Why, very well; I be He, sir, 
sitting, as say, in a lower chair, sir; in 
the of Grapes, where indeed you a delight 
to sit, have you not? 

FROTH: 
I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.
 
POMPEY:
Why, very well, hope here be truths. 

ANGELO:
This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
Hoping find good cause to whip all. 

ESCALUS:
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
Now, sir, come on: what was done Elbow's wife, once more? 

POMPEY:
Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once. 
 
ELBOW: 
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man to my wife. 

POMPEY: 
I beseech your honour, ask me.

ESCALUS:
Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?

POMPEY: 
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a 
good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?

ESCALUS: 
Ay, sir, very well.
 
POMPEY:
Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.

ESCALUS: 
Well, I do so.

POMPEY:
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?

ESCALUS:


POMPEY: 
I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
worst thing about how could Master Froth do the 
constable's wife any I would know that of 
your honour.

ESCALUS:
He's in right. Constable, say you to it? 

ELBOW: 
First, an it like you, the house respected 
house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
mistress is respected 


By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
than any of us all. 
 
ELBOW: 
thou thou liest, wicked 
time has yet to come that she was ever respected
with man, woman, or child. 

POMPEY:
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her. 
 
ESCALUS:
Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
this true?
 

O thou caitiff! O varlet! thou 
Hannibal! I respected with her I was married 
to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
with me, let not your worship me the poor 
duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
have mine of battery on thee. 

ESCALUS: 
If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
action of slander too. 

ELBOW: 
Marry, I good for it. What is't 
worship's pleasure shall do with this wicked caitiff? 

ESCALUS: 
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
in courses till thou knowest what 
are. 
 
ELBOW: 
Marry, thank worship for it. Thou seest, thou 
wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.

ESCALUS: 
Where were you born, friend? 
 
FROTH:
Here in Vienna, sir.


Are you of fourscore pounds a year?

FROTH: 
Yes, an't please you, sir. 
 
ESCALUS:
So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPHEY:
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS: 
Your mistress' name? 

POMPHEY: 
Mistress Overdone. 

ESCALUS:
Hath had any more than husband? 

POMPEY:
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS: 
Come to me, Master Froth. Master 
Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
more of you.
 
FROTH: 
I thank your worship. mine own part, I never 
come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
in. 

ESCALUS:
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your 
name, Master tapster?

POMPEY:
Pompey.
 
ESCALUS:
What else?
 
POMPEY:
Bum, sir. 

ESCALUS:
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; 
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.

POMPEY: 
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.

ESCALUS:
How would you live, by being a bawd? What 
do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?

POMPEY: 
If the law would allow sir. 
 
ESCALUS: 
But the law will not it, Pompey; nor it shall 
not be allowed in Vienna.
 
POMPEY:
Does worship mean to geld and splay all 
youth of the city?
 
ESCALUS:
No, Pompey. 
 
POMPEY:
Truly, in poor will to't 
If your worship will take order for the drabs and
the you need not to fear the bawds. 

ESCALUS: 
There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
it is but heading and hanging.
 
POMPEY: 
If you head and hang all that offend that way but
for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a 
for more if this law hold in 
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the house in it 
after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
come to pass, say Pompey told you 

ESCALUS: 
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
prophecy, hark you: advise you, let me not find 
you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd 
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

POMPEY:
I thank your worship for your good counsel:
but I follow it the flesh and fortune shall 
better determine.
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
The valiant heart is not whipt his trade. 

ESCALUS: 
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?

ELBOW: 
Seven year and a half, 

ESCALUS: 
I thought, by readiness in the office, you had 
in some time. You say, years 

ELBOW: 
And a half, sir.


it hath great pains to you. They you 
wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there 
in your ward sufficient to serve it?
 
ELBOW:
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they 
are chosen, they are glad choose me for them; I 
do it for some piece of money, through 
all.
 
ESCALUS:
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
the most sufficient of your parish.

ELBOW:
To your worship's house, sir?
 
ESCALUS: 
To my house. Fare you 
What's o'clock, think you?

Justice:
Eleven, sir. 

ESCALUS:
I pray you home to dinner with me. 

Justice: 
I humbly thank you.
 
ESCALUS:
It grieves me for the death Claudio; 
no remedy. 

Justice:
Lord is severe. 

ESCALUS:
It is needful: 
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
is still the nurse of second woe: 
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.
 
Servant:
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
I'll tell him of you.

Provost:
Pray you, do.
I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
hath but as offended in a dream! 
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
To die for't!
 
ANGELO:
Now, what's the matter. Provost?


Is it Claudio shall die 

ANGELO:
Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?
 
Provost:
Lest might be too rash: 
Under your good correction, I have seen,
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er doom. 

ANGELO: 
Go let that be mine: 
Do you your office, or give up your place,
And you shall well spared. 
 
Provost:
I crave honour's 
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.
 
ANGELO:
Dispose of her
To more fitter and that with speed. 

Servant: 
Here is the sister of the condemn'd 
Desires access to you.
 
ANGELO: 
Hath he a sister?

Provost: 
Ay, good lord; a very virtuous maid, 
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
If not already.

ANGELO:
Well, let her be admitted.
See you the fornicatress be removed:
Let have not means; 
There shall be order for't.


God save 

ANGELO:
Stay a little while. 
You're welcome: your will? 

ISABELLA: 
am a woeful to your honour, 
Please but your honour me. 
 
ANGELO: 
Well; your suit? 

ISABELLA:
There is a vice that do abhor, 
And desire should the blow of 
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For I must not plead, but that I am 
war 'twixt will and will 
 
ANGELO:
Well; the matter?

ISABELLA:
I have a brother condemn'd to 
do beseech you, let it be his fault, 
And not my brother.

Provost:
 
ANGELO:
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
Mine were the very cipher of a function,
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
And let go by the actor.
 
ISABELLA:
O just severe law! 
I a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour! 

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Must he needs die?


Maiden, no 

ISABELLA: 
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him, 
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

ANGELO: 
I will not do't. 

ISABELLA: 
But can you, if you would?
 
ANGELO:
Look, what I will that I cannot do. 
 
ISABELLA:
But you and do world no 
If so your heart touch'd that 
As is to him? 

ANGELO:
He's sentenced; 'tis too 

LUCIO: 

ISABELLA: 
Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
May call it back again. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
marshal's truncheon, nor the robe, 
Become them with half so a grace 
As does. 
If he had been as you and you as he,
You would have slipt like but like you, 
Would not have been so stern.
 
ANGELO:
Pray gone. 
 
ISABELLA: 
I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
No; would tell to be a 
And what a prisoner.

LUCIO: 

ANGELO: 
Your brother is forfeit of the law, 
And you but waste your words.

ISABELLA: 
Alas, alas! 
Why, all souls that were forfeit once; 
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be,
If He, which is the top judgment, should 
But judge you as you are? on 
And mercy then breathe within 
Like man new made.
 
ANGELO:
Be content, fair maid; 
It is the law, I condemn your brother: 
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
To-morrow! O, that's Spare him, spare him! 
He's prepared for death. Even for kitchens 
We kill the of season: shall we serve heaven 
With less respect than we minister 
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
many have it. 
 
LUCIO:

ANGELO:
The law hath not been dead, though hath slept: 
Those many had not dared to do that evil,
the first that did infringe 
Had answer'd for deed: now 'tis awake 
Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass, that what future evils, 
Either new, by remissness new-conceived, 
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
Are now to no successive 
But, ere to 
 
ISABELLA:
Yet show some 

ANGELO:
I show it most of I show 
For then I pity those not know, 
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall; 
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Your brother dies be 

ISABELLA:
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent 
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
To it like a giant. 
 
LUCIO: 

ISABELLA: 
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
For every pelting, petty officer 
use his for thunder; 
Nothing but Merciful 
Thou rather with thy sharp bolt 
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
the soft myrtle: man, proud man, 
Drest in a little brief authority,
Most of he's most assured, 
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks high heaven 
As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
Would all themselves laugh mortal.

LUCIO:
 
Provost:

ISABELLA:
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Great may jest with 'tis wit in them, 
But in the less foul profanation.
 
LUCIO: 
Thou'rt i' the girl; more that. 
 

That in the captain's but a 
Which the soldier is flat blasphemy. 
 
LUCIO:
 
ANGELO: 
Why do you put these sayings upon me?

ISABELLA:
Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brother's life.
 
ANGELO:
 
ISABELLA:
Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO: 
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.


How! 
 
ISABELLA: 
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you. 

LUCIO: 
 
ISABELLA:
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold, 
Or whose rates are either rich poor 
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there 
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To temporal. 

ANGELO:
come to-morrow. 
 
LUCIO:

ISABELLA: 
Heaven keep honour safe! 
 
ANGELO: 
 
ISABELLA:
At hour to-morrow 
Shall I 
 
ANGELO:
At any time 'fore noon. 

ISABELLA:
'Save your honour!
 
ANGELO:
From thee, even from thy virtue!
What's this, this? Is this her fault or mine? 
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
carrion does, as the 
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can be 
That modesty may more betray our sense
woman's lightness? waste enough, 
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary 
And our there? O, fie, fie, fie! 
What dost what art thou, Angelo? 
Dost thou desire foully for those things 
That make her good? O, let her brother live!
for their robbery have authority 
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Is that doth goad us 
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Once my temper; but 
Subdues me quite. Even now, 
When men I smiled and how. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Hail to you, provost! so I think are. 

Provost:
I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bound by my charity my blest order, 
come to visit the afflicted spirits 
Here prison. Do me common right 
To me them and to make know 
The nature their crimes, I may minister 
To them accordingly. 
 

I do more that, if more were needful. 
Look, here comes one: gentlewoman of mine, 
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
And that it, 
More fit to do another such offence 
Than die for this. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
must he die? 
 
Provost: 
As I do think, to-morrow.
I have provided for you: stay awhile, 
And you shall be conducted. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you 
 
JULIET:
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll how you shall arraign conscience, 
And penitence, if it be sound, 
Or hollowly put on.

JULIET: 
I'll gladly learn.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Love the man that wrong'd you? 

JULIET:
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
 
VINCENTIO: 
So then it your 
Was 

JULIET:
Mutually.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

JULIET:
I do confess it, and repent it, father. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
so, daughter: lest you do repent, 
As the sin brought you to 
Which is always towards ourselves, not heaven, 
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear,--
 
JULIET:
I do repent me, as it is an evil,
take the shame joy. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
There 
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you, Benedicite! 

JULIET: 
Must die to-morrow! O injurious love, 
That respites me a life, whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!

Provost: 
'Tis pity of him. 

ANGELO: 
When I would pray and think, I think and pray
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
Whilst my invention, not my tongue, 
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
if I but only chew his name; 
And in heart strong and swelling evil 
Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
Is like a good thing, being often read, 
Grown fear'd and yea, my gravity, 
Wherein--let hear me--I take pride, 
I boot for an idle plume, 
Which air beats for vain. O O form, 
How often thou thy case, thy habit, 
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
'Tis not the devil's crest.
How who's there? 
 
Servant:
One a sister, access to you. 

ANGELO:
Teach her the 
O heavens!
Why does blood thus to my heart, 
Making both it unable for itself, 
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
By which he should revive: and even 
The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their own in obsequious 
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence.
How now, fair maid?

ISABELLA:
I am come to know your pleasure. 

ANGELO:
That you might know it, would much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.

ISABELLA:
Even Heaven keep your honour! 
 
ANGELO:
may he live awhile; and, 
As long as you or I yet he must die.

ISABELLA: 
Under your 
 

Yea.
 
ISABELLA:
I beseech you? that in his reprieve, 
Longer or shorter, may be so fitted 
That his soul sicken not.

ANGELO: 
Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that from nature stolen 
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away life 
As to put metal in restrained means 
To make a false one. 
 
ISABELLA: 
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in 

ANGELO: 
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
had rather, that the most just law 
Now took your life; or, to redeem him, 
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?
 
ISABELLA:
Sir, believe this,
I had rather give my body than my soul.
 
ANGELO:
I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.


How say you?

ANGELO:
not that; for I can speak 
Against the thing say. Answer to this: 
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
there not be charity in sin 
To this brother's life? 

ISABELLA:
to 
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO: 
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA: 
That I do beg life, if be sin, 
me bear it! you granting of my suit, 
If that be sin, I'll my morn 
To have to the faults of mine, 
And of answer. 

ANGELO:
Nay, but hear 
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
Or seem so and that's not good. 
 
ISABELLA:
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good, 
But graciously to know am no better. 

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When doth tax itself; these masks 
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
Your brother is to die.

ISABELLA:
So.
 
ANGELO:
And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain.
 
ISABELLA:
True.
 
ANGELO: 
Admit no other way to save his life,--
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
But in the loss of question,--that you, 
Finding yourself desired of such a person,
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
fetch your brother the manacles 
Of the all-building law; and that there were
No earthly mean to him, but that 
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To supposed, or else to let 
What would you do? 

ISABELLA: 
As much for my poor brother as myself:
That is, were I under the terms of death,
impression of keen whips I'ld wear as 
And strip myself to death, as to a bed
That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
My body up to shame.

ANGELO:
Then must your brother die.

ISABELLA:
And 'twere the way: 
Better it were a brother died at once, 
Than that sister, by redeeming him, 
Should die for ever.
 
ANGELO: 
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you slander'd 
 
ISABELLA: 
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

ANGELO:
You seem'd of to make the law tyrant; 
And the sliding of your brother 
A merriment than a vice. 

ISABELLA: 
O, me, my lord; oft falls out, 
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
I something do excuse the I hate, 
For his advantage that I dearly love.

ANGELO: 
We are all frail.


Else let brother die, 
If not feodary, but only he 
Owe and succeed thy 

ANGELO: 
Nay, women are frail too.

ISABELLA:
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
profiting them. Nay, call us ten times 
For we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO: 
I think it well:
And from this testimony your sex,-- 
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
If you be one, as you are well express'd
By all external warrants, show it now,
By putting on the destined livery.
 
ISABELLA: 
I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
Let me entreat you speak the former language.

ANGELO: 
Plainly conceive, I love you.
 
ISABELLA: 
My brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall die for it.
 
ANGELO:
He shall not, give me love. 
 
ISABELLA: 
I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
Which a little fouler than it is, 
To pluck on others.

ANGELO:
Believe me, on mine honour, 
words express my purpose. 

ISABELLA:
Ha! little honour to believed, 
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; for't: 
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
Or an outstretch'd throat tell the aloud 
What man thou art.
 
ANGELO:
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
My against you, and my place i' state, 
Will so your accusation overweigh,
That you stifle in your own report 
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
all nicety and prolixious blushes, 
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he must not only die the death,
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
To Answer me to-morrow, 
Or, by the affection that guides me most, 
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.

ISABELLA:
To whom should I complain? Did tell 
Who believe me? mouths, 
bear in one self-same tongue, 
Either of condemnation or approof;
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
To follow as draws! to brother: 
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
Yet he in a mind of 
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them 
Before his sister should her body stoop 
To abhorr'd pollution. 
Then, Isabel, chaste, and, brother, die: 
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

CLAUDIO: 
The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope: 
I've hope live, and am prepared to die. 

DUKE 
Be absolute either or 
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason with life: 
If I do lose I do lose thing 
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That habitation, where thou keep'st, 
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
For thou labour'st by thy flight to shun 
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. of rest is sleep, 
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Thy is no more. art not thyself; 
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get, 
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou not certain; 
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If rich, thou'rt 
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear's heavy riches a journey, 
And death thee. Friend hast thou none; 
thine own bowels, which do thee sire, 
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do the gout, serpigo, and the 
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for blessed youth 
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty, 
To make thy pleasant. What's yet in 
That bears the name of in this life 
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.
 
CLAUDIO:
I humbly thank you.
To sue to I find I seek to 
And, seeking death, find it come on. 



Provost:
Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.

CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I thank you.

ISABELLA:
My business is a word or two with Claudio.

Provost: 
And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
a word with you. 


As many as you please.

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Bring to them speak, where may be concealed. 

CLAUDIO:
Now, sister, what's the comfort? 

ISABELLA:
Why, 
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
Lord having affairs 
you for his swift ambassador, 
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
Therefore your best make with speed; 
To-morrow you set on.

CLAUDIO:
Is there no remedy? 
 
ISABELLA:
None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart 
 
CLAUDIO:
But is there any?
 
ISABELLA: 
Yes, you may live: 
There is a mercy in judge, 
If you'll implore that will free your life, 
But fetter you till death.

CLAUDIO:
Perpetual durance?

ISABELLA: 
Ay, durance, a restraint, 
Though the world's vastidity you had, 
To a determined scope.

CLAUDIO:
But in nature? 
 
ISABELLA:
In such a one as, you consenting 
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
And leave you naked. 

CLAUDIO: 
Let me know the point.

ISABELLA:
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst 
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die? 
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
the poor beetle, that we 
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great 
As when a giant dies. 

CLAUDIO: 
Why give you me this shame?
Think I can a fetch 
If I must die, 
I will encounter darkness as a bride,
And hug it in mine arms.
 
ISABELLA:
There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Did utter forth voice. die: 
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth 
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
His filth within being cast, he would appear 
pond deep as hell. 
 

The prenzie Angelo!
 
ISABELLA: 
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
The damned'st body to invest and cover
In guards! Dost thou Claudio? 
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou mightst be freed.
 

heavens! it cannot be. 

ISABELLA:
he would give't thee, from this rank 
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest to-morrow.

CLAUDIO:
Thou shalt do't. 

ISABELLA: 
O, were it but my life,
I'ld throw it down your deliverance 
As frankly as a pin.
 

Thanks, dear 

ISABELLA:
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
 
CLAUDIO:
Yes. Has he affections in him, 
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose, 
When would force it? Sure, is sin, 
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least. 

ISABELLA:
is the least? 

CLAUDIO: 
If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

ISABELLA:
What says my brother? 
 
CLAUDIO:
Death is a fearful thing. 
 
ISABELLA:
And life a 

CLAUDIO: 
Ay, and we not where; 
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd winds, 
And with violence round about 
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
that lawless and incertain 
Imagine 'tis too horrible! 
The weariest and most loathed 
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
Can on nature is a paradise 
To what we fear of death.

ISABELLA: 
Alas, 

CLAUDIO: 
Sweet sister, let me live:
What sin you do to save a brother's 
Nature dispenses the deed far 
That it becomes a virtue.

ISABELLA:
O you beast! 
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice? 
not a kind of incest, to take life 
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, should proceed: 
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word to save thee.


Nay, hear Isabel. 

ISABELLA:
O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
'Tis best thou diest quickly.

CLAUDIO: 
O hear me, 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word. 


What is your will?
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
by have some speech you: 
would is likewise your own benefit. 
 

I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
stolen out of other but I will attend you 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Son, I overheard what hath passed between you 
and your sister. Angelo had never purpose to 
her; only hath made an essay of her 
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
of natures: she, having the truth of her, 
hath made him that denial which he is 
glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
know this true; prepare yourself to 
death: do satisfy your resolution with hopes 
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to 
your knees and make ready.


Let me ask my sister pardon. I so love 
with that I sue to rid of it. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hold you there: farewell.
Provost, a word with you!

Provost: 
What's your will, father 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me 
awhile with the maid: my mind promises 
habit no loss shall touch her by my company. 
 
Provost: 
In good time.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good: 
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
The assault that hath made to 
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but 
that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
substitute, and to save your brother?
 

I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
brother die by the law than my son should be
unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
speak to him, I will my lips in vain, 
government. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a wronged 
lady a merited benefit; your brother from 
the angry law; stain to own gracious 
person; and much please the absent duke, if
peradventure he shall have hearing of 
this business.
 
ISABELLA:
Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have 
you not speak of Mariana, the sister of 
Frederick great soldier who 
 
ISABELLA: 
have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name. 
 
VINCENTIO: 
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced 
to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
which time of the contract and limit of the
solemnity, brother Frederick was wrecked at sea, 
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
kind him, the and sinew of 
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
 
ISABELLA: 
Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few, 
bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she 
wears his he, a marble her tears, 
washed with them, relents not. 


What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
from the world! What corruption in this life, that
it let this man of this can she avail? 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
you from dishonour in doing it.
 
ISABELLA:
Show father. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
of her first affection: his unkindness, that 
in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
like an impediment in the current, made it more
violent unruly. Go you to answer his 
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
his the point; refer yourself to 
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
This granted in course,--and now follows 
all,--we shall advise this maid to stead up 
your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
her recompense: and here, by is brother 
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
advantaged, the corrupt deputy maid 
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. 
think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
What you 

ISABELLA: 
The image of it gives me content already; and I
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
 
DUKE 
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
for this you to his 
bed, of satisfaction. I will 
presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
call upon dispatch Angelo, that 
it may be quickly. 

ISABELLA: 
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
 
ELBOW:
Nay, if there be no remedy for it, that you will 
needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.
 
DUKE 
O heavens! what here 
 
POMPEY: 
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and
furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.

ELBOW:
Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you, good brother father. What 
this made you, sir? 

ELBOW: 
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
him be a thief too, for have found 
upon him, sir, a strange have 
sent to the deputy. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd! 
The evil that causest to done, 
That is to but think 
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
From abominable and beastly touches 
I I array and live. 
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go 
 
POMPEY:
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
sir, I would 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit. 
 
ELBOW: 
He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
warning: deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if 
he be a whoremonger, and before he were 
good a mile on his errand. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
That all, as some would to be, 
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!
 
ELBOW:
His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir. 

POMPEY: 
I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
of mine. 


How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
Caesar? art led in triumph? What, is there 
none of Pygmalion's newly woman, to be 
had now, for the hand pocket and 
extracting it clutch'd? reply, ha? What 
sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
thou, Trot? Is world as it was, man? Which is 
the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
trick of it?

DUKE 
thus, and thus; still worse! 

LUCIO: 
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
still, ha? 

POMPEY:
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
is herself in the tub.

LUCIO: 
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
to prison, Pompey?

POMPEY: 
Yes, faith, sir. 
 

Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?

ELBOW:
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

LUCIO:
Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he 
doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me the 
Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
will the house. 
 
POMPEY:
I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

LUCIO:
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If 
you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
more. trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
And you. 

LUCIO:
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

ELBOW: 
Come your ways, sir; come.
 
POMPEY: 
You will not bail me, then, sir?

LUCIO:
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
what news?
 
ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.
 
LUCIO:
Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
What news, friar, the duke? 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know none. Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO: 
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
some, he Rome: but where he, think you? 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
 
LUCIO: 
was fantastical trick of him to steal from 
the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
puts transgression to 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He does well in 't.

LUCIO: 
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
him: something too crabbed that way, friar. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
is general a vice, and must cure it. 

LUCIO:
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
it is well allied: but it is impossible extirp 
quite, friar, till and drinking be put 
down. They say this Angelo was not made man and 
woman after this downright way of creation: is it
true, think you? 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
How he be 

LUCIO: 
Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
was begot between two stock-fishes. But it 
that when he makes water urine is 
congealed ice; I know to true: he a 
motion generative; infallible. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
 
LUCIO: 
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for 
rebellion codpiece to take away the life of 
man! the that absent have done 
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
bastards, he would have paid for the nursing 
a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
knew and that instructed him mercy. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I never heard the absent duke much detected for
women; he was not inclined that way.
 
LUCIO: 
O, sir, you are deceived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis not possible.

LUCIO:
Who, not duke? yes, your of fifty; and 
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the 
duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
that let me inform you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO:
Sir, I inward of A shy fellow was 
duke: and I believe I know the cause of his 
withdrawing. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, I prithee, might be the cause?
 
LUCIO:
No, pardon; a secret must be within 
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
understand, the greater file of subject held the 
duke to be wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! why, no question but he was.

LUCIO:
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
the very stream life and the business he hath 
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
proclamation. him be but testimonied in his own 
bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
envious a scholar, a statesman a 
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.

LUCIO:
Sir, I know him, and I love him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love talks with better and 
dearer love.

LUCIO: 
Come, sir, I know what I know. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
I can hardly believe that, you not what 
you speak. But, if ever the return, as our 
prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
upon you; and, I pray you, your name?

LUCIO:
Sir, my name is Lucio; to duke. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
report you.
 
LUCIO:
I fear you not. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again. 
 
LUCIO: 
be hanged first: thou art deceived in 
friar. But more of this. thou tell 
Claudio die to-morrow or no? 

DUKE 
Why he 

LUCIO:
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
the duke we talk of were returned again: the
ungenitured will unpeople the province

house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke 
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would 
never bring them to would 
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
duke, I say to thee again, would eat on 
Fridays. He's not past it and I to 
would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown 
bread and say that I said 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No might nor greatness in mortality
censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny 
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
tie gall in slanderous 
comes here? 

ESCALUS: 
Go; away with her to prison!

MISTRESS OVERDONE: 
Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
merciful good my lord. 
 
ESCALUS: 
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
tyrant. 

Provost:
A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may please 
your honour. 
 
MISTRESS OVERDONE:
My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
he promised her marriage: his 
is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob: 
I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!


That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
called before us. with her to prison! Go to; 
more 
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
if my brother wrought by my pity, it not be 
so with him.


So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
advised him for the entertainment of death.
 
ESCALUS:
even, good father. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Bliss and goodness on you!

ESCALUS:
Of whence are you?
 
VINCENTIO: 
Not of this country, though my chance is now
To use it for my time: I am a brother
gracious order, late come from the See 
In special business from his holiness.

ESCALUS:
What news abroad i' the world? 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
None, but that there so great a fever on 
goodness, that dissolution of it must cure it: 
novelty is only in request; and it dangerous 
to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous 
to be constant in any undertaking. There scarce 
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but 
security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
news enough, yet is every day's news. I 
you, sir, of what disposition was the duke? 

ESCALUS: 
One that, above all other contended 
especially to know himself. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
What pleasure was he given to?

ESCALUS:
Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
any which professed to make him rejoice: a 
gentleman of all temperance. But leave him to 
events, with a prayer they may prove 
and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
prepared. I am made understand that you have 
lent him visitation.

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
He professes to have received no sinister measure
from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
resolved to 

ESCALUS: 
You have paid the heavens your function, and the
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have 
for the poor the extremest 
shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
If his own life answer the straitness of his
proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

ESCALUS: 
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Peace be with you!
He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe;
Pattern in to know, 
Grace stand, and virtue go; 
More nor less to others 
Than by self-offences weighing. 
Shame to him whose cruel striking 
Kills for faults of his own liking! 
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what may man within him hide,
angel the side! 
may likeness made in crimes, 
Making practise on the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most ponderous and substantial things!
Craft against vice I must 
With Angelo to-night shall lie
His old betrothed but despised;
So disguise shall, by the disguised,
Pay with false exacting, 
And an contracting. 
 

MARIANA:
Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away: 
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
You had not found me here so musical:
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis good; though oft a charm 
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
I pray, you, tell me, hath body inquired 
for me here to-day? much upon this time have
I promised here to meet.
 
MARIANA:
You have not been inquired 
I have sat all day. 
 
DUKE 
I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
now. I your forbearance a little: 
I call upon you anon, for some to yourself. 
 
MARIANA:
I am always bound to you.
 
VINCENTIO: 
Very well met, and well come. 
is the news from this good deputy? 

ISABELLA: 
He hath a garden circummured with brick, 
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
to that vineyard a planched 
That makes his opening with this bigger key:
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
There made my promise 
Upon the middle of the night 
To call upon him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA:
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
With whispering and most guilty 
action all of precept, he me 
way 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Are there no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISABELLA:
No, none, only a repair i' dark; 
And that have possess'd him my most stay 
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
I come about my brother. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
'Tis borne up. 
I have not yet made to Mariana 
A word this. within! come forth! 
I pray you, with this maid; 
She comes to do you good.
 
ISABELLA: 
do desire the like. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
you persuade yourself that I respect you? 
 

Good friar, I know do, and found it. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Take, then, this your companion by hand, 
Who a story ready for your ear. 
I shall attend your but make 
The vaporous night approaches.

MARIANA:
Will't please you walk aside?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
place and greatness! millions of false eyes 
Are stuck thee: volumes of report 
Run with false and most contrarious quests 
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fancies.
Welcome, how agreed?

ISABELLA:
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not my consent,
my entreaty too. 
 
ISABELLA:
Little have you to say
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember my brother.' 

MARIANA:
Fear 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
is husband on a pre-contract: 
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin, 
Sith that the justice of your title to him 
Doth flourish deceit. Come, let us go: 
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

Provost:
Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?

POMPEY:
the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he a 
married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
cut woman's head. 
 
Provost:
Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
direct To-morrow morning are to die 
and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
will take it on you to assist him, shall 
redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
your full time of imprisonment and your 
with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
notorious bawd. 

POMPEY:
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
would be glad to receive some instruction from my 
fellow partner.

Provost:
What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?

ABHORSON: 
you 

Provost: 
here's a fellow will you to-morrow in 
execution. If you think it meet, compound 
him by the year, and let him abide here with you; 
not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.
 
ABHORSON:
A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.

Provost:
Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
scale. 
 
POMPEY:
Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
good favour you but that you have a hanging 
look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?

ABHORSON:
Ay, sir; a mystery

POMPEY:
Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I 
should be hanged, I cannot imagine.

ABHORSON:
Sir, it is a mystery. 
 

Proof?
 
ABHORSON: 
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
too true man thinks 
big enough; it be too big for thief, your 
thinks it little so true man's 
apparel fits your thief.
 
Provost: 
Are you agreed? 

POMPEY: 
Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
a more penitent than your bawd; he doth 
oftener ask forgiveness.
 
Provost:
You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
to-morrow four o'clock. 

ABHORSON:
Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.

POMPEY:
I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you 
occasion to use me for your own turn, shall find 
me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
a good turn.

Provost: 
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:
The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
Look, Claudio, death: 
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow 
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine? 


As lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour 
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
He will not 

Provost: 
Who can do good on him?
Well, go, 
But, hark, what noise?
Heaven give your spirits 
By and by. 
I hope it some pardon or 
the most gentle 
Welcome father.

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night 
Envelope you, good Who call'd here of late? 

Provost:
None, since the curfew rung.

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Isabel? 

Provost:


DUKE 
They will, then, ere't be long.
 
Provost: 
comfort is for 
 
DUKE 
There's some in hope.

Provost: 
It a bitter 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not so, not so; his life parallel'd 
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
He doth with holy subdue 
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others: were meal'd that 
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just.
are they come. 
This is a gentle provost: seldom when 
The steeled gaoler the men. 
How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.

Provost: 
There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Have no countermand Claudio yet, 
But he must die to-morrow?

Provost:
None, sir, 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.
 
Provost: 
Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we:
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath the public ear 
Profess'd the contrary.
This is his lordship's man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And comes Claudio's 
 
Messenger: 
 
Provost:
I shall obey him. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost:
I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
in mine office, awakens this unwonted 
putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
let's hear. 

Provost:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What that who is be executed in the 
afternoon?
 

A Bohemian born, but here un bred; one 
that is a prisoner nine years old.

VINCENTIO: 
How came it that the absent duke had not either
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
have it was ever his manner to do 

Provost:
His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
It is now apparent?
 
Provost: 
Most manifest, and not denied himself. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
seems he be touched? 
 
Provost: 
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
mortality, and desperately mortal. 
 
DUKE 
He wants advice.

Provost: 
He none: he hath evermore had the liberty 
of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
would not: drunk times a day, if not many days 
entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
More him anon. There is written in your brow, 
honesty and constancy: I read it not 
truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the 
boldness of cunning, I lay myself in hazard. 
Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is 
no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced him. To make you this in a 
manifested effect, I crave but four days' 
for the which you are to do me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy. 
 
Provost:
Pray, sir, in what?

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
In delaying 

Provost:
lack, how may I do it, the hour limited, 
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
his head in the view Angelo? I may my case 
as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the vow of mine I warrant you, if my 
instructions may be your this Barnardine 
be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.

Provost: 
Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
death: you know course is common. If thing 
fall to more than thanks and good 
fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
against it with my life.

Provost: 
Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
sworn to the duke, or to the deputy? 


To him, to his substitutes. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
avouch the of your dealing? 
 
Provost: 
what likelihood in 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet I see 
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
with ease attempt you, I go 
further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. 
sir, here is hand and seal of 
duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
signet is not strange to you.
 
Provost: 
both. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
shall find, within these two days he will be here.
This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
very receives letters of strange 
perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
into some monastery; but, by chance, of what 
is writ. Look, unfolding star the 
not yourself into amazement how these 
things should be: all difficulties are but easy 
when they are known. Call and off 
with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
shrift advise him for a better place. Yet you 
amazed; this shall absolutely resolve you. 
Come away; it is almost clear dawn.


I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
of profession: one would think it were Mistress 
Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
for a of brown and old 
ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
five marks, ready money: marry, then was not 
much in request, for the old women were all dead.
is there here one Caper, at the suit of 
Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young 
Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger and young 
Drop-heir that lusty Pudding, and 
Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed 
Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in 
our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'

ABHORSON: 
Sirrah, bring hither. 
 
POMPEY:
Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
Master Barnardine! 
 
ABHORSON:
What, ho, Barnardine!
 
BARNARDINE:
 
POMPEY:
Your friends, the hangman. You must be so 
good, sir, to rise and be put to death.

BARNARDINE:
 

Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

POMPEY: 
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
executed, and sleep afterwards. 

ABHORSON: 
Go in to him, fetch out. 

POMPEY:
is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear straw rustle. 

ABHORSON: 
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
 
POMPEY: 
Very ready, 
 
BARNARDINE:
How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?
 
ABHORSON: 
Truly, sir, I would you clap into your 
prayers; look you, the warrant's come. 
 
BARNARDINE:
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for 

POMPEY:
O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
is hanged betimes the morning, may 
sounder all the next day.
 
ABHORSON: 
Look you, sir; here comes your do 
we jest now, think you?
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
you and pray with you. 
 
BARNARDINE:
Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,
and I will have time prepare me, or they 
shall beat out my brains with I will not 
consent to die this day, that's certain.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go.

BARNARDINE:
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's


DUKE VINCENTIO:
hear you. 
 
BARNARDINE:
Not a you have any thing to say to me, 
come to my for thence will to-day. 
 
VINCENTIO: 
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; him to the block. 

Provost: 
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
A creature unprepared, unmeet for 
And to him in the mind is 
damnable. 

Provost:
Here prison, father, 
There died this morning of a cruel fever
Ragozine, a notorious pirate, 
A man of years; beard and head 
of his colour. if we omit 
This reprobate he were well inclined; 
And the with the visage 
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio? 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws 
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
And sent according to command; whiles I 
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die. 

Provost:
This shall done, 
But Barnardine must die this afternoon: 
And how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive?

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Let this done. 
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio: 
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, shall find 
Your safety manifested. 
 
Provost:
I am your free dependant.
 
DUKE 
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Now will I write letters to 
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall proceed with Angelo.


Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For would with you of things 
That want no ear but yours.

Provost: 
I'll make all speed.
 
ISABELLA: 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
yet her brother's pardon be come hither: 
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
When it is least expected. 


Ho, by your leave!
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

ISABELLA:
The given me holy a man. 
Hath yet the deputy my brother's pardon? 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
He hath released him, Isabel, from the world: 
His head is off and sent to Angelo. 
 
ISABELLA:
Nay, but it is not so.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
In your close patience.
 

O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall not be to his sight. 
 
ISABELLA:
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
hurts him nor profits you a jot; 
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark I which shall find 
By every syllable a faithful verity:
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes; 
One of our convent, and his confessor,
Gives me this instance: already he carried 
and Angelo, 
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good I would wish it go, 
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
And honour. 
 
ISABELLA: 
am by you. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
Say, by this token, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your course. Who's here?
 
LUCIO: 
Good even. where's the provost? 
 
DUKE 
Not within, sir.
 
LUCIO:
O pretty Isabella, I pale at mine heart to see 
thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for 
head fill one fruitful set 
me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
at home, he had lived. 
 
VINCENTIO: 
Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO: 
Friar, thou knowest not the so well as I do: 
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye 
 
LUCIO:
I'll go along with thee 
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
they be true; if not true, none were enough.

LUCIO: 
once before him for getting a wench with 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
you a thing? 

LUCIO:
marry, did I but fain to forswear it; 
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well. 

LUCIO:
By my troth, I'll go with thee to end: 
if talk offend we'll have very little of 
it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.
 

Every hath writ hath disvouched other. 

ANGELO: 
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions 
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
not tainted! why meet at the 
redeliver our authorities there
 
ESCALUS: 
I guess not.

ANGELO: 
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
entering, that if any crave redress of 
exhibit their petitions the street? 
 
ESCALUS:
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
complaints, and to deliver us from devices
hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
against us.
 
ANGELO: 
Well, I beseech let it be betimes 
i' the I'll call you at your house: give 
notice to such sort and suit are to meet 
him. 

ESCALUS:
I shall, sir. Fare you well.
 
ANGELO:

This deed unshapes me quite, makes unpregnant 
dull to proceedings. A deflower'd maid! 
And by an eminent body that enforced
The law against it! But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against 
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no; 
For my authority bears bulk, 
That no scandal once can 
But it confounds breather. have lived, 
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times revenge, 
By dishonour'd life 
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
A lack, once our grace we have forgot, 
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
These at fit time deliver 
The provost knows our purpose and our plot. 
matter afoot, keep your instruction, 
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
As cause minister. Go at house, 
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, to Crassus, 
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.
 
FRIAR PETER:
It shall be speeded well.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
Come, we will There's other of our friends 
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.
 
ISABELLA:
To so indirectly I am loath: 
would say the truth; but to so, 
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

MARIANA:
Be ruled by him.
 
ISABELLA: 
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
He speak against me on side, 
should not think it strange; 'tis a physic 
That's bitter to sweet end.

MARIANA:
I would Friar Peter--

ISABELLA:
O, peace! the is come. 

FRIAR PETER:
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
He shall pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded; 
generous and gravest 
Have gates, very upon 
The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away! 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My very worthy fairly met! 
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.
 
ANGELO:
Happy return be to your royal grace!
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Many and hearty thankings to you both. 
We have made you; and we hear 
Such goodness your justice, that our soul 
Cannot but yield forth to public thanks, 
Forerunning more requital.
 
ANGELO: 
make my bonds still greater. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
O, your speaks and should wrong 
To it the wards of covert bosom, 
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A residence 'gainst the tooth of time 
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And let subject see, to know 
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus, 
You must walk by us on our other hand;
good supporters are 

FRIAR PETER:
Now is your time: speak loud before him. 
 
ISABELLA:
Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard 
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Here Angelo shall give you justice: 
Reveal yourself to him. 
 

O worthy duke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
Hear me I must speak 
Must either punish me, not being 
Or redress from you. Hear O hear me, here! 
 
ANGELO: 
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
Cut by of justice,-- 

ISABELLA:
By course justice! 
 
ANGELO:
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

ISABELLA:
Most yet most truly, will I speak: 
That Angelo's forsworn; is it strange? 
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator; 
Is it not strange and strange?
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, it is ten times strange. 

ISABELLA: 
It is not truer he is Angelo 
Than this is all as true as it is strange:
Nay, it is ten times for truth is truth 
To the end of reckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Away with her! Poor soul, 
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

ISABELLA:
O prince, I conjure thee, thou 
There is another comfort than this world,
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked'st ground, 
May shy, grave, as as absolute 
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Had more name for 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
By mine honesty,
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense, 
Such dependency of on thing, 
As e'er I heard madness. 
 
ISABELLA:
gracious duke, 
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
inequality; your serve 
To make truth appear where it seems hid, 
And hide the false seems true.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many that are not mad
Have, sure, lack of reason. What would you 

ISABELLA:
I the sister of one 
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
I, probation of a sisterhood, 
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger,--
 
LUCIO:
That's I, an't like your grace:
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
try her gracious fortune with Lord 
her poor pardon. 
 
ISABELLA:
he indeed. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
were not bid to speak. 

LUCIO: 
No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

DUKE 
wish you now, then; 
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have 
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect. 
 
LUCIO:
warrant your honour. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't. 
 
ISABELLA: 
This gentleman told somewhat of my 
 
LUCIO:
Right. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.
 
ISABELLA:
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,-- 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
madly spoken. 
 
ISABELLA: 
Pardon it; 
The is to the matter. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Mended again. The matter; proceed.

ISABELLA: 
In brief, to the needless process by, 
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion 
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift my body 
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And I did yield to him: but the next morn 
His purpose surfeiting, a warrant 
For my poor brother's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
is most likely! 

ISABELLA: 
O, that it were as like as it is true!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practise. his integrity 
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason 
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
not have cut off. Some one hath set 
Confess and say by advice 
camest here to complain. 

ISABELLA:
And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Keep me in and with ripen'd time 
Unfold the evil which is here 
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
I, thus unbelieved go! 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
Who knew Your intent and coming hither? 
 
ISABELLA:
One that would were here, Friar Lodowick. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

LUCIO:
lord, know him; 'tis a meddling friar; 
I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
For certain spake against your grace 
In your I had swinged him soundly. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
against me? this is a good friar, belike! 
And to set on this wretched woman here 
Against our Let this friar be found. 
 
LUCIO: 
But lord, she that friar, 
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow. 
 
FRIAR PETER: 
Blessed be your royal grace!
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
Your royal ear abused. First, hath 
Most wrongfully accused your substitute, 
Who is as free from touch or soil with her 
As she from one ungot.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
 
FRIAR PETER:
I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
As by 
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.
 
LUCIO:
My lord, most villanously; believe it.
 
FRIAR PETER:
Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
But at this instant he is my lord, 
a strange fever. mere request, 
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither, 
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
Is true and false; and what he with his oath
And will up full clear, 
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
To justify this worthy nobleman, 
So vulgarly and personally accused,
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes, 
Till she herself confess 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good friar, let's hear it.
Do you not smile this, Lord Angelo? 
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause. this witness, 
First, let her show her face, and after speak.
 
MARIANA:
Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
Until my bid me. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
What, are you married?
 
MARIANA: 
No, my lord.
 
VINCENTIO: 
Are you a 

MARIANA:
No, my lord.

VINCENTIO: 
A widow, 

MARIANA:
Neither, my lord.
 
DUKE 
Why, are then: maid, nor 


My lord, she may be punk; for many of are 
maid, widow, 

VINCENTIO: 
Silence that fellow: I would some 
To prattle for himself. 
 
LUCIO: 
Well, my lord.
 
MARIANA:
My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
And I confess besides I am maid: 
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not he knew me. 
 
LUCIO:
was drunk then, my can be better. 
 
DUKE 
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
 

Well, lord. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
This is witness Angelo. 

MARIANA:
Now I come to't my lord 
She that accuses him of fornication,
doth accuse my 
And charges him my lord, with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
With all the effect of love.
 

Charges she more than me?
 
MARIANA:
Not that I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say your husband.


Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew body, 
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
 

This is strange abuse. Let's see thy face. 
 
MARIANA: 
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
This that face, thou cruel 
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel, 
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
In her imagined person. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Know you this woman?
 
LUCIO: 
Carnally, she says.

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Sirrah, no more!
 
LUCIO:
Enough, my lord. 
 
ANGELO:
I must confess I know this woman: 
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition, but in chief 
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time of five years
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.
 

Noble prince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth virtue, 
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone garden-house 
knew me a wife. As this true, 
Let me safety raise me from my knees 
Or else for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!
 
ANGELO:
I did but now: 
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
sets them on: let me have way, my lord, 
To find this out. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, with my heart 
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
they would swear down each particular saint, 
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is friar that them 
Let him be sent for.
 
FRIAR PETER:
Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed 
Hath set the women on to this complaint:
Your provost knows the place where he abides
And he may fetch him. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
do it instantly. 
And you, my noble and well-warranted 
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
But stir not you till you have well determined
Upon these 

ESCALUS:
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Signior you say you knew that 
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

LUCIO:
'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
and one that spoke 
villanous speeches of the duke. 
 
ESCALUS:
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him: we shall this friar a 
notable fellow.

LUCIO:
As any in Vienna, on my word.

ESCALUS:
Call that same Isabel here once I speak with her. 
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
shall see how I'll handle her.

LUCIO: 
Not better than he, by her own report.

ESCALUS: 
Say you? 

LUCIO: 
I think, if you handled her privately, 
would perchance, publicly, 
she'll be ashamed.

ESCALUS:
I will go darkly to work with her.

LUCIO: 
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.

ESCALUS:
Come on, mistress: here's a denies all 
that said. 

LUCIO:
My lord, here the rascal I of; here 
the provost. 
 
ESCALUS: 
In very good time: speak not you to him till we 
upon 

LUCIO:
Mum. 

ESCALUS:
Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
false. 
 

How! know you where you are?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Respect to your and let devil 
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne! 
Where is duke? 'tis he should hear me 
 
ESCALUS:
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak: 
Look you speak justly.

VINCENTIO: 
Boldly, at least. But, O, souls, 
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.

LUCIO:
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

ESCALUS:
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women 
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul 
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
the duke himself, to with 
Take him hence; the rack him! We'll touse you 
Joint by joint, but will know purpose. 
'unjust'! 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Be not so hot; the duke 
Dare no more stretch this finger mine than he 
Dare rack own: his subject am I not, 
provincial. My state 
Made a looker on here in Vienna, 
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'er-run the stew; for all faults, 
But faults countenanced, that the strong statutes 
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop, 
As much in mock as mark.

ESCALUS: 
Slander to Away him to prison! 

ANGELO: 
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?
 
LUCIO: 
he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate: 
do you know me?
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.
 

O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Most sir. 


Do you so, sir? And the duke a fleshmonger, 
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?


You sir, change persons me, ere make 
that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
more, much 
 
LUCIO:
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
thy 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.

ANGELO:
Hark, how the villain would close now, after his 
treasonable abuses!


Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with 
him prison! Where is the provost? Away with him 
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
with the other confederate 
 
VINCENTIO: 

ANGELO: 
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

LUCIO:
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
you? Show your visage, with a pox to you! 
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour! 
Will't not off? 

VINCENTIO: 
Thou art first knave that madest a duke. 
provost, let me bail these gentle 
Sneak not away, for the friar 
Must have a word Lay hold him. 

LUCIO:
This may prove worse than hanging.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 

ANGELO: 
dread lord, 
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To I can undiscernible, 
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
my be mine own confession: 
Immediate sentence then and sequent death 
Is all the grace beg. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast e'er contracted to this woman? 


I was, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return here Go with him, provost. 
 
ESCALUS:
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the of 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
hither, Isabel. 
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then 
Advertising and holy to business, 
Not changing heart with am 
Attorney'd your 

ISABELLA:
O, give pardon, 
That I, vassal, have employ'd and pain'd 
Your unknown sovereignty! 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
You are pardon'd, Isabel:
dear maid, be you as free to us. 
Your brother's I sits at heart; 
And you may why I obscured myself, 
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash of my hidden power 
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which lives to fear: make it your 
So happy is your brother.
 
ISABELLA:
I do, lord. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
For this new-married man approaching here,
Whose imagination hath wrong'd 
well defended honour, you must pardon 
For Mariana's sake: but as adjudged your brother,-- 
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for for death!' 
Haste still and answers leisure; 
Like doth quit like, and still FOR MEASURE. 
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to like haste. 
with him! 

MARIANA: 
O my most gracious lord,
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage else imputation, 
For that he knew you, might reproach your life
And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal,
buy a better husband. 

MARIANA: 
O my lord, 
other, nor no better man. 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Never him; we are definitive. 
 
MARIANA: 
Gentle my liege,--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do but lose your labour. 
Away with him to death!
Now, sir, to you.

MARIANA:
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life to do you 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Against all sense you do importune her:
Should she kneel in of fact, 
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.

MARIANA:

Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
They say, best men are 
And, for the become much the better 
For being little bad: so my husband. 
O Isabel, will you lend a knee? 

VINCENTIO: 
He dies for Claudio's death.

ISABELLA:
Most bounteous sir, 
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if brother lived: I think 
A due sincerity his deeds, 
Till he did look on me: since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did the thing for which he died:
For Angelo, 
His act did not his bad intent, 
And must be buried but as an intent
perish'd by thoughts are no subjects; 
Intents but merely thoughts. 
 
MARIANA:
my 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your unprofitable; stand up, 
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an hour? 


It so. 
 
DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Had you special for the deed? 

Provost: 
No, my good lord; it was by private message.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which I do discharge you of your office:
Give up your keys.

Provost: 
Pardon me, noble lord:
I it was a fault, but knew it not; 
Yet repent me, after more advice; 
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserved alive.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's 
 
Provost: 
His name is Barnardine.

VINCENTIO: 
I would thou by Claudio. 
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

ESCALUS: 
I sorry, one learned and so 
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

ANGELO:
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart 
I crave death more willingly than mercy; 
'Tis my deserving, I do entreat it. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Which is that Barnardine? 

Provost: 
This, my lord.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
There was a friar told of this man. 
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them 
pray thee take this mercy to provide 
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your What muffled fellow's that? 

Provost:
This is another prisoner I saved. 
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Claudio as 

DUKE VINCENTIO:
 
LUCIO:
'Faith, my lord. I it according to the 
trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but 
had rather it would please you I might be whipt.

DUKE 
Whipt first, sir, hanged after. 
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
Is any woman wrong'd by fellow, 
As I have heard him swear himself there's one 
Whom he begot with let her appear, 
And he shall marry her: finish'd, 
him be whipt and hang'd. 

LUCIO:
I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold. 

DUKE VINCENTIO: 
Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
slanders I forgive; and therewithal 
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed. 

LUCIO:
Marrying punk, to death, 
whipping, and hanging.
 
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Slandering a prince deserves it.
She, Claudio, you wrong'd, look you restore. 
Joy Mariana! Love Angelo: 
have confess'd and I her 
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
There's more behind that is more gratulate. 
Thanks, for thy care and secrecy: 
We employ thee in place. 
him, Angelo, brought you home 
The head of Ragozine Claudio's: 
The pardons itself. Dear Isabel, 
I have a motion much imports your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline, 
mine yours and what is yours mine. 
So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should 

SLY: 
I'll pheeze you, faith. 
 
Hostess:
A pair of stocks, you rogue! 
 
SLY: 
a the Slys are no look in 
chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror. 
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!

Hostess: 
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
 
SLY: 
No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
bed, and warm thee.

Hostess:
I know my remedy; must go fetch the 
third--borough. 
 

Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
and kindly. 


Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd; 
And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach. 
Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound. 

Huntsman: 
Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
He cried upon it the 
And to-day pick'd out dullest scent: 
me, I take him for better dog. 


Thou art fool: if Echo were as fleet, 
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well and look unto them all:
To-morrow intend to hunt 

First Huntsman:
I will, my lord. 

Lord: 
What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?
 
Second Huntsman: 
He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
This were bed but cold to sleep so soundly. 


O monstrous how like a he 
death, and loathsome is thine 
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
What think you, if convey'd to 
in sweet clothes, rings put upon his 
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
Would not the beggar then forget himself?

First Huntsman: 
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.

Second Huntsman: 
It would seem strange him when he waked. 

Lord:
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Then take him up and manage well the jest:
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
Balm his head in warm distilled 
And burn wood to lodging 
Procure me music ready when wakes, 
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
And if he to be straight 
And with a low submissive reverence
Say 'What is it your honour will command?' 
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
Another bear ewer, the third a diaper, 
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
Some one be ready a costly suit 
And ask him apparel he will wear; 
tell him of his hounds and horse, 
And that his lady mourns at his disease:
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
And when he says he is, say that he dreams, 
For he is but a mighty lord. 
This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
It will be pastime passing excellent,
If it be husbanded with modesty.

First 
My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
As he shall think by our true diligence
He is no than what we say he 
 
Lord:
Take him up gently and bed with him; 
And each one to office when he wakes. 
Sirrah, see what trumpet 'tis that sounds: 
Belike, noble gentleman that means, 
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
now! who it? 
 
Servant:
An't please your honour, players
That offer service to your lordship.
 

Bid them come near.
Now, fellows, you are welcome.
 
Players: 
We thank your 

Lord: 
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
 
A Player:
So please your lordship to accept our duty.


all my heart. This I remember, 
Since once he play'd a eldest son: 
'Twas where you woo'd the so well: 
I have forgot your name; but, sure, part 
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd. 

Player: 
I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
 
Lord: 
'Tis true: didst it 
Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
The rather for I have some sport in hand
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
But I am doubtful of your modesties;
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
For yet his honour never heard a play--
You into some passion 
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
If you should smile he grows impatient.


Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
Were he the veriest antic in the world.
 
Lord:
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
And give friendly welcome one: 
Let them want nothing that my house affords. 
Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
And him dress'd all suits a lady: 
done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber; 
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
Tell me, as he will win my love, 
He bear himself with honourable action,
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies 
Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
Such duty the drunkard let him do 
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And say 'What is't your honour will command,
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
May show her duty and make love?' 
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses, 
And with declining head into his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd 
To see her noble lord restored to health,
Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
No better a poor loathsome 
And if the boy have not a woman's gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears, 
An onion will do well for such a shift,
Which in a napkin being close convey'd
in despite enforce a eye. 
See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
Anon I'll give thee more instructions. 
I the boy will well usurp the grace, 
Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman: 
I long hear him call the drunkard husband, 
how my men will stay from laughter 
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
May well abate the over-merry spleen 
otherwise would grow into extremes. 

SLY:
For sake, pot of small ale. 

First Servant:
Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?

Second Servant: 
please honour taste these conserves? 
 
Third 
will wear to-day? 
 
SLY:
I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
'lordship:' I drank sack in my life; and if 
you give me any conserves, give me conserves of 
beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I
have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
than legs, nor no more than feet; nay, 
sometimes feet than shoes, or such shoes as my 
through the over-leather. 

Lord: 
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
O, that a mighty man of descent, 
Of such and high 
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
 
SLY:
What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher 
Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a
pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation 
bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? 
Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if 
she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence
on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the
lyingest knave in Christendom. I am not 
bestraught: here's--

Third 
O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!

Servant: 
this is it that makes your servants droop! 

Lord:
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
home thy ancient thoughts from banishment 
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays, 
And twenty caged nightingales do sing: 
Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed 
On trimm'd up for Semiramis. 
Say thou wilt walk; the ground: 
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them 
And fetch shrill echoes from earth. 
 
First Servant:
Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
breathed stags, fleeter the roe. 
 
Second Servant: 
Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
Adonis painted by a running brook,
Cytherea all in sedges 
Which seem to move and with her breath, 
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.

Lord: 
We'll show thee Io as she was 
And how she was beguiled and surprised,
As lively painted as the deed was done.

Third Servant:
Daphne roaming through a thorny wood, 
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
And at that sight shall sad Apollo 
So the blood and tears drawn. 

Lord:
Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this waning age.
 
First Servant:
And till the tears she hath shed for 
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
She the creature the world; 
And yet is inferior to 
 
SLY:
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
I do not I see, I hear, I speak; 
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft 
Upon my I am a lord indeed 
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
Well, bring our hither to our sight; 
And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.

Second 
Will't your mightiness to wash your 
O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
O, that once you knew but what you are! 
These you have been a 
Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.

SLY: 
These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
But did I speak of all that 

First Servant:
O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
Yet you say ye were beaten out of door; 
And rail upon the hostess of the house;
And say you would present her the leet, 
she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts: 
Sometimes would call out for Cicely Hacket. 

SLY:
Ay, the woman's maid of the house.

Third Servant:
Why, sir, you no house nor no such maid, 
Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
twenty more names men as 
Which never were nor no ever saw. 

SLY:
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!

ALL:
Amen.
 

I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.

SLY: 
Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.

Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her? 
 
SLY:
Are you and will call me husband? 
My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.

Page: 
My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
I am your wife in all obedience.
 
SLY:
I know it well. What must I call her? 

Lord:
Madam.

SLY: 
madam, or Joan madam? 
 
Lord: 
'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords 
call ladies.

SLY: 
Madam wife, they say I have dream'd 
And slept above some fifteen year or more.
 
Page:
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
Being all this time abandon'd from your bed. 
 
SLY: 
'Tis much. Servants, me her alone. 
Madam, undress you and now bed. 
 
Page:
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
To pardon yet for a or two, 
Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
For your physicians have expressly charged, 
peril to former malady, 
That I should yet absent me your bed: 
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.

SLY:
Ay, it stands so that I may hardly
tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in 
despite of the and the blood. 
 

Your players, your amendment, 
Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
For so your doctors hold it very meet,
Seeing much hath congeal'd your 
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy: 
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play 
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.

SLY:
Marry, I will, them it. Is not a 
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
 
Page:
No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.
 
SLY: 
What, household stuff?

Page:
It is a kind history. 
 
SLY:
Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side
and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since for the great desire I had
To see Padua, 
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy;
And by father's love am arm'd 
With his good will and thy good 
My trusty servant, well approved in all,
Here let us breathe and haply institute
A course learning and studies. 
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
me my being father first, 
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
come Bentivolii. 
Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness
By virtue specially to be achieved.
me thy for I have left 
And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
satiety seeks to quench his thirst. 

TRANIO:
Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad you thus continue your resolve 
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline, 
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to cheques 
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
Balk logic that you have 
And rhetoric in your common talk; 
Music poesy use to quicken 
The mathematics and the metaphysics,
Fall them as you find your stomach serves you; 
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en: 
brief, sir, what you most affect. 
 
LUCENTIO: 
Gramercies, Tranio, well thou 
If, Biondello, thou wert ashore, 
We could at once put us in readiness,
And take a lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall 
But stay a while: what company is this?
 
TRANIO:
Master, some show to welcome us to town.
 
BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
For I firmly am resolved know; 
That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder:
If either of you love 
Because I know you well and love you well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
 
GREMIO:


I pray you, sir, your 
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
 
HORTENSIO:
Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
 
KATHARINA:
I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
I wis it is not half way to her heart; 
But if it were, not her care should 
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and use you like a fool.

HORTENSIA: 
From all such Lord deliver 

GREMIO:
And me too, good Lord!

TRANIO: 
master! here's some good toward: 
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

LUCENTIO:
But in the other's silence do I see 
mild behavior and sobriety. 


TRANIO: 
Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill. 

BAPTISTA: 
Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
have get you in: 
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.

KATHARINA:
A peat! is best 
Put finger in the eye, an she knew why. 
 
BIANCA:
you in my discontent. 
Sir, to pleasure humbly I subscribe: 
My books and instruments shall be my company, 
On them to practise by myself. 

LUCENTIO:
Hark, thou Minerva speak. 
 

Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
Sorry I our good will effects 
Bianca's grief.

GREMIO: 
Why will you mew her up,
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
And make her bear the penance of her 
 
BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, ye; I am 
Go in, Bianca: 
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music, and poetry, 
Schoolmasters will I keep house, 
Fit instruct youth. you, Hortensio, 
Or you, know any such, 
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
I will be very kind, and liberal
To children good bringing up: 
so farewell. may 
For I more to commune with Bianca. 

KATHARINA: 
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
I appointed hours; as though, belike, I 
knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?

GREMIO: 
You may devil's your gifts are so 
good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not
so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
if I any means light on 
to her that wherein she delights, I will 
wish him to her father.

HORTENSIO:
So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,
that we may yet again have access to our fair
mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
labour and one thing 

GREMIO:
What's that, I pray? 
 
HORTENSIO:
sir, to get a husband for her 
 
GREMIO: 
A husband! a devil.

HORTENSIO:
I say, a husband. 

GREMIO: 
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, 
father be rich, any man very a 
to be married to hell?

HORTENSIO: 
Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine
to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,
would take her with all faults, and money enough.

GREMIO: 
I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
this condition, to be whipped at the high cross 
morning. 
 
HORTENSIO: 
Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
friends, it shall be so far forth friendly 
maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
be his dole! He that runs gets the ring. 
How say you, Signior Gremio?
 
GREMIO:
I and would I had given him the best 
horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
woo her, wed her bed and rid the 
house of her! Come on. 
 
TRANIO:
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
That should of a sudden hold? 

LUCENTIO: 
O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
I never thought it possible or likely;
But see, while idly I stood looking on,
I found the effect love in idleness: 
And now in do confess to 
That art to me as secret as 
As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
If I achieve not this young modest girl.
Counsel me, for I know thou canst; 
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
 
TRANIO:
Master, it is no time to chide you now;
Affection is not rated from the heart:
If have touch'd you, nought remains but so, 
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
 

Gramercies, forward; this 
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.

TRANIO:
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of 
 

O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

TRANIO:
Saw you no more? mark'd you how her sister 
Began scold and raise up such a storm 
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
 
LUCENTIO: 
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
And with her breath she did perfume the air:
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
 
TRANIO:
Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from trance. 
I pray, awake, sir: if love the maid, 
Bend thoughts wits to her. Thus it stands: 
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd 
That till the father rid his hands of her,
Master, your love must live a maid at home;
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
 
LUCENTIO:
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's 
But thou not advised, he took some care 
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?

TRANIO:
Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.


I have it, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Master, for my hand,
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.

LUCENTIO:
Tell me thine first.

TRANIO:
You will be schoolmaster
And undertake the maid: 
That's your device.

LUCENTIO: 
It is: may it be done?
 
TRANIO: 
Not possible; for who shall bear part, 
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
countrymen and them? 
 
LUCENTIO:
Basta; content thee, for I it full. 
We have not yet been seen in any house,
Nor can we lie by our faces 
man or master; then it follows thus; 
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Keep house and port and servants as I should:
I will some other be, some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
'Tis hatch'd and shall so: Tranio, at once 
Uncase thee; take my hat and cloak: 
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee; 
I will charm him first to his tongue. 
 
TRANIO:
So had you need. 
In brief, sir, sith it your is, 
And I am tied to be obedient;
For so father charged me at our 
'Be serviceable to my quoth he, 
Although in 
content to be Lucentio, 
so love Lucentio. 

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves: 
And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Here comes the rogue.
Sirrah, where have you been?

BIONDELLO:
Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?

LUCENTIO: 
Sirrah, hither: 'tis no time to jest, 
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
And I for my escape have put on his;
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
you on him, I charge you, as 
While I make way from hence to save my life:
You understand me? 

BIONDELLO:
a whit. 
 
LUCENTIO:
not a jot your mouth: 
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
 
BIONDELLO: 
The better for him: would I were 

TRANIO:
So could I, faith, to have the next wish after, 
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
When am alone, why, then I am Tranio; 
But in all places else your master Lucentio.
 
LUCENTIO: 
Tranio, let's go: thing more that 
thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if 
thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good
weighty. 

First Servant:
lord, you nod; you do not the 

SLY: 
Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely: 
comes there any more of it?

Page: 
My lord, 'tis but begun. 

SLY:
'Tis very excellent piece of work, madam lady: 
'twere done! 


Verona, for a while I take my leave,
To see my friends in Padua, but of all
best beloved and approved friend, 
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say. 
 
GRUMIO:
Knock, sir! should I knock? is there man has 
rebused your worship?

PETRUCHIO: 
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.

GRUMIO:
you here, sir! why, sir, I, that 
I should knock you here, sir?
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Villain, I say, knock me at gate 
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
 
GRUMIO:
My master is grown quarrelsome. I should 
you 
And then I know after who comes by the worst. 

PETRUCHIO: 
Will it not be?
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

GRUMIO: 
Help, masters, help! my is mad. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain! 

HORTENSIO:
How now! the matter? My old friend Grumio! 
and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
 
PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.

HORTENSIO: 
'Alla nostra casa venuto, molto signor 
mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
this 

GRUMIO:
Nay, 'tis no sir, he 'leges in Latin. 
this be not a lawful case for me to leave his 
service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
him soundly, was it fit for a servant to 
use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
 
PETRUCHIO:
A villain! Good Hortensio, 
I rascal knock upon your 
not get him my heart to do it. 
 
GRUMIO:
at the gate! heavens! Spake not 
words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
now with, 'knocking at gate'? 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.

HORTENSIO: 
patience; I am Grumio's pledge: 
Why, a chance 'twixt and you, 
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
And now, sweet friend, happy gale 
Blows you here from 

PETRUCHIO: 
Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
To seek fortunes farther than 
Where small experience grows. But in a few, 
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Antonio, my father, is deceased;
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
to wive and thrive as best I may: 
Crowns in my purse I and at home, 
And so am abroad the world. 
 
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, shall then come roundly to thee 
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
And promise shall be rich 
very rich: but much my friend, 
And I'll not thee to her. 

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
Be foul as was 
As old as Sibyl and as curst and 
As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
moves not, or removes, at least, 
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
come to wive it wealthily in Padua; 
If wealthily, happily in Padua. 

GRUMIO:
look you, he tells you flatly what his 
mind is: Why him gold enough and marry him to 
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
a tooth in her she have as many diseases 
as and fifty nothing amiss, 
so money comes withal.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, we are stepp'd thus far in, 
will continue that I in jest. 
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
Brought up as best becomes a 
Her and that is 
that she is intolerable curst 
shrewd froward, beyond all measure 
That, state far worser it is, 
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
me father's name 'tis enough; 
For I will her, she chide as loud 
As when the clouds in autumn crack. 

HORTENSIO:
Her father is Baptista 
An affable and courteous gentleman:
Her name is Katharina Minola, 
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
 
PETRUCHIO:
I know her father, though I know not her; 
And he knew my deceased father 
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
And therefore let me be thus bold with 
give you over at this first encounter, 
Unless you will accompany me thither.
 
GRUMIO: 
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she 
would think scolding would do little good upon him:
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in 
his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
him but a he will throw a figure in 
her face and so disfigure her with it that she
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
You know not, sir. 

HORTENSIO: 
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee, 
in Baptista's keep my treasure 
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
His daughter, 
her withholds me and other more, 
to her and rivals in my 
Supposing it a thing impossible,
For those defects I before rehearsed, 
That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
this order hath Baptista ta'en, 
That none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.
 
GRUMIO:
Katharina the curst!
A for maid of all titles the worst. 

HORTENSIO:
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
And offer me disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
That so I may, device, at least 
Have leave and leisure to love her 
And unsuspected court her by herself.

GRUMIO:
Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,
how the young folks lay their heads together!
Master, master, about you: who there, 

HORTENSIO:
Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of love. 
Petruchio, stand by a while.

GRUMIO: 
A stripling and an amorous! 

GREMIO:
O, very well; I have perused the note.
Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:
All books of love, that at any hand; 
And see you read no other lectures to her:
You understand me: over and beside
Signior Baptista's 
mend it with a largess. Take too, 
And let me have them very well perfumed
she is sweeter than perfume itself 
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
 
LUCENTIO:
read to her, I'll plead for you 
As for my patron, stand you so assured,
firmly as were still in place: 
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
 
GREMIO:
O this learning, what a thing it is!

GRUMIO: 
woodcock, what an ass is! 
 
PETRUCHIO:
Peace, sirrah!
 
HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio. 

GREMIO: 
you well 
Trow you I am going? To Baptista Minola. 
I promised to inquire carefully
About schoolmaster for the fair 
by fortune have lighted well 
On this young man, for learning and behavior
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.
 
HORTENSIO:
'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
Hath promised me to help me to another,
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
So shall I no whit be behind in duty 
fair Bianca, so beloved of me. 
 
GREMIO:
Beloved of and that my deeds shall prove. 
 

And that his bags shall prove.

HORTENSIO:
Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either. 
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
Upon agreement from us to his liking,
Will to woo curst 
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.

GREMIO: 
So said, so done, is well.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

PETRUCHIO:
I is an irksome brawling scold: 
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm. 
 
GREMIO:
No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?

PETRUCHIO:
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
And I do hope good days and long to see.

GREMIO: 
sir, such a life, with such a wife, strange! 
But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
You shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wild-cat?

PETRUCHIO: 
Will live? 


Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.

PETRUCHIO:
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little can daunt mine 
Have I not in my time heard roar? 
Have I not heard sea puff'd up 
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great in the field, 
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not in pitched battle heard 
Loud and trumpets' clang? 
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue, 
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will chestnut a fire? 
Tush, tush! fear with bugs. 

GRUMIO:
For he fears none.
 
GREMIO: 
Hortensio, hark: 
This is happily arrived, 
My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
 

I promised we would be contributors
And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er. 
 
GREMIO:
And so we will, provided that he win her.


I would were sure of a dinner. 
 
TRANIO:
Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
Tell me, I which is readiest way 
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?


He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?
 
TRANIO: 
he, 
 
GREMIO:
Hark you, sir; you mean not to-- 
 
TRANIO:
Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to 

PETRUCHIO:
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
 
TRANIO: 
I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.

LUCENTIO: 
Well begun, Tranio.

HORTENSIO: 
Sir, a word ere you go;
Are you a to maid you talk of, yea or no? 
 
TRANIO: 
if sir, is it any 

GREMIO: 
No; if without more words you will get you hence.

TRANIO: 
I pray, are the streets as free 
For me as for you?
 
GREMIO: 
But so is not she.

TRANIO:
For what reason, I beseech you?

GREMIO:
For this reason, if you'll know,
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.


That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen, 
Do me this right; hear me with patience. 
Baptista is noble 
To whom my father not unknown; 
And were his daughter fairer than she is, 
She may more suitors have and me for one. 
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then well one may fair Bianca have: 
And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris to 
 
GREMIO:
What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.

LUCENTIO:
Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade. 

PETRUCHIO: 
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
 

Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?

TRANIO:
No, but hear I do that he two, 
The one famous for a scolding 
As is the other for beauteous modesty.


Sir, sir, first's let her 
 
GREMIO: 
that labour Hercules; 
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, understand you of sooth: 
The youngest daughter whom you hearken for
Her father from all access of 
will not promise her to any man 
Until the elder sister first be wed:
The younger then is free and not before.
 
TRANIO:
If it be so, sir, that you are the man
stead us all me amongst the rest, 
And if you break ice and do this 
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate. 

HORTENSIO:
you say well and well you do conceive; 
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
To whom we all rest generally beholding.

TRANIO: 
Sir, I not slack: in sign 
Please ye we contrive this afternoon, 
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
And do adversaries do law, 
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
 
GRUMIO:
O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
 
HORTENSIO: 
The motion's good indeed and be it so,
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.
 
BIANCA:
sister, wrong me not, wrong 
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain: but for these other gawds, 
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, my petticoat; 
Or what you will command me will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.

KATHARINA: 
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, 
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
 
BIANCA: 
Believe me, sister, of all the men 
I never yet beheld special face 
Which I could fancy more than any other.
 
KATHARINA:
Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?

BIANCA: 
If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I'll you you shall have 
him. 
 
KATHARINA:
O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep you fair. 
 
BIANCA: 
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you jest, and now I perceive 
You have but jested with me all this while:
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
 
KATHARINA:
If jest, then the rest was 
 
BAPTISTA: 
Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
Bianca, Poor she weeps. 
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her. 
For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

KATHARINA:
Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.

BAPTISTA:
What, in sight? Bianca, get in. 


What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, she must have a husband; 
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding 
And love to her apes in hell. 
not to me: I go and weep 
Till I can find occasion revenge. 
 
BAPTISTA:
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
But who comes here?

GREMIO: 
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.

BAPTISTA: 
Good morrow, neighbour 
God save you, gentlemen!
 
PETRUCHIO: 
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?
 
BAPTISTA:
I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.

GREMIO:
You are too blunt: go to it orderly. 

PETRUCHIO:
wrong me, Gremio: give me 
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Her affability and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous and mild behavior, 
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
Of that which I so oft have heard. 
And, for to my entertainment, 
I do present you with a man of mine,
Cunning in music and the mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant: 
Accept of him, or else you me wrong: 
His born in Mantua. 
 
BAPTISTA: 
You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know, 
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.

PETRUCHIO: 
I see you mean to part with her, 
Or else you like not my company. 
 
BAPTISTA: 
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?

PETRUCHIO: 
is my name; Antonio's 
A man well known throughout all Italy.

BAPTISTA:
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
 
GREMIO: 
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Let us, are poor petitioners, speak 
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
 
PETRUCHIO:
O, me, Signior Gremio; would fain be 
 
GREMIO: 
I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
Neighbour, is a gift very I am 
sure it. To express the like kindness, 
that been more kindly beholding to you than 
any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
that been studying at Rheims; as cunning 
in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray, 
his 
 
BAPTISTA:
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
Welcome, good Cambio.
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
I be so bold to know cause of your coming? 
 
TRANIO:
Pardon sir, the boldness is mine 
That, being a stranger this city here, 
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous. 
Nor is your firm resolve 
In the preferment of the eldest sister. 
This liberty is all that I request,
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
And free access and favour as the rest:
And, toward the education of your daughters,
I here simple instrument, 
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then their worth is great.

BAPTISTA: 
Lucentio is your name; whence, pray? 
 
TRANIO:
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.

BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of Pisa; by report
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within! 
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen 
To daughters; and tell them 
These are their tutors: bid them use well. 
We will go walk a little in the orchard,
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
 

Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
And every day cannot come to woo. 
You knew my father well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
What dowry shall I with her wife? 
 
BAPTISTA:
After my death the one half of my lands,
And in thousand crowns. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
And, for that dowry, assure her of 
Her be it that she survive me, 
In all my and whatsoever: 
Let specialties be therefore 
That covenants may be kept on either hand.

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
And where two raging fires meet together
They that their fury: 
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
extreme gusts will out fire and all: 
So I to her and so she yields to me;
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
 
BAPTISTA: 
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
That shake not, blow 

BAPTISTA: 
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
 
HORTENSIO: 
For fear, I promise if I look pale. 


What, will daughter a good musician? 
 
HORTENSIO:
think she'll sooner prove a 
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
 
BAPTISTA: 
Why, then thou not break to lute? 
 
HORTENSIO: 
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering; 
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
with them:' 
And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
through the instrument my made way; 
And there I stood amazed for a while, 
As on a pillory, the lute; 
While did call me rascal fiddler 
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
As had she studied to misuse me so.

PETRUCHIO: 
by it a lusty wench; 
I love her times more than e'er did: 
O, how I long to have some chat with her!

BAPTISTA: 
Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior will you go with us, 
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?

PETRUCHIO: 
I pray you do.
will attend her here, 
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she why then tell her plain 
sings sweetly as nightingale: 
Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
morning roses newly wash'd with 
Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
commend volubility, 
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence: 
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
As though she bid me stay by her a week:
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
When I shall ask the banns and when be 
But she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak. 
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.
 
KATHARINA:
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing: 
call me Katharina that do talk me. 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny and sometimes Kate the curst; 
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate, 
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Hearing thy mildness praised every town, 
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.

KATHARINA:
Moved! good time: let him that moved you hither 
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
a 
 

Why, what's a moveable? 
 
KATHARINA: 
A join'd-stool. 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me. 

KATHARINA:
are made to bear, and so 

PETRUCHIO: 
Women are made to bear, and so you. 

KATHARINA: 
No such jade as you, if me you mean.
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Alas! good Kate, will not thee; 
For, knowing thee to be but young and light--

KATHARINA:
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should--buzz!

KATHARINA: 
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?

KATHARINA: 
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.

KATHARINA: 
If I waspish, best beware my 


My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
 
KATHARINA: 
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,

PETRUCHIO:
Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In tail. 

KATHARINA: 
In his tongue.
 

Whose tongue?

KATHARINA:
Yours, you tails: and so farewell. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again, 
I am a gentleman. 

KATHARINA:
That I'll try. 

PETRUCHIO: 
I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again. 
 

So may you lose your arms: 
If you strike me, you are no gentleman; 
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.


A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!

KATHARINA: 
What is your crest? 

PETRUCHIO: 
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
 
KATHARINA:
No cock mine; crow too like craven. 


Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look 


It is my fashion, when I see a crab.


Why, here's no crab; and therefore sour. 
 
KATHARINA: 
There is, there is. 

PETRUCHIO: 
Then show me. 
 
KATHARINA: 
Had I a glass, I would. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
What, you mean my face?
 
KATHARINA:
Well aim'd of such a young one.

PETRUCHIO: 
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
 
KATHARINA:
Yet you wither'd. 

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis with cares.
 
KATHARINA: 
I care not.
 
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth scape not so. 

KATHARINA: 
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
 

No, not a whit: I find passing gentle. 
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
And I find report a very liar; 
For are gamesome, passing courteous, 
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
Thou canst not frown, not askance, 
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will, 
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers, 
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Why does the world report that 
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
hazel and sweeter than the kernels. 
O, let me see walk: thou dost not 

KATHARINA:
fool, and thou keep'st command. 

PETRUCHIO:
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA: 
Where did you study all this goodly speech?

PETRUCHIO: 
It is extempore, my mother-wit. 


A witty mother! witless else her son.
 
PETRUCHIO: 
I not wise? 

KATHARINA:
Yes; keep you warm.
 
PETRUCHIO:
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed: 
And therefore, setting all this 
in terms: your father hath consented 
That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you. 
Kate, am a husband for your 
For, this light, whereby I see thy 
Thy beauty, that make me thee well, 
Thou must be to no man but me; 
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates.
Here comes your father: never make denial;
I must and will have Katharina to my wife.
 
BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?

PETRUCHIO: 
How but well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss.

BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your 

KATHARINA:
Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
You have show'd a tender regard, 
To wish me wed to one lunatic; 
A mad-cup ruffian a swearing Jack, 
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

PETRUCHIO: 
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
If she curst, it is for policy, 
For not as dove; 
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove a Grissel, 
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity: 
And conclude, we have 'greed so well together, 
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

KATHARINA: 
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first. 

GREMIO: 
Hark, says see thee 
hang'd first. 

TRANIO:
Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
 
PETRUCHIO:
patient, gentlemen; I her for myself: 
If she and I be pleased, what's that to you? 
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being 
That she shall still be curst in company.
I 'tis incredible to 
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
How when men and women are alone, 
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day. 
the feast, and bid the guests; 
be sure Katharina shall be fine. 

BAPTISTA:
I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
you joy, 'tis a match. 

GREMIO: 
Amen, say we: be witnesses. 

PETRUCHIO:
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
I will to comes apace: 
will have rings and things and fine array; 
And kiss Kate, we be married 

GREMIO:
Was ever clapp'd up suddenly? 

BAPTISTA: 
Faith, now I play a part, 
And venture madly on a desperate mart. 

TRANIO:
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you: 
'Twill gain, or perish on the seas. 
 

The gain I is, in the match. 
 
GREMIO: 
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch. 
But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
Now the day we long have for: 
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.


And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can or your thoughts can guess. 
 
GREMIO:
Youngling, canst not love dear as I. 
 
TRANIO: 
thy love doth 


But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back: 'tis nourisheth. 
 
TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
 
BAPTISTA:
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both 
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?

GREMIO: 
First, as you know, my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
hangings of tapestry; 
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, 
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd 
Valance of Venice gold in needlework, 
and all things that belong 
To house then, at my 
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Sixscore fat standing my stalls, 
And all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
If whilst I live she will be 

TRANIO: 
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's heir and only son:
If your daughter my wife, 
I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
have I pinch'd Gremio? 
 
GREMIO: 
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
land amounts not to so in all: 
That she shall have; besides an argosy
That now is lying Marseilles' road. 
What, have I choked you with an argosy?

TRANIO: 
Gremio, known my father hath no 
Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
And twelve tight these I will assure her, 
And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st 

GREMIO:
Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
can have no more all I have: 
like she shall have and mine. 
 
TRANIO: 
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
By your promise: Gremio is out-vied. 

BAPTISTA: 
I must confess your offer the best; 
And, let your make her the assurance, 
She own; else, you must pardon me, 
if you should die before him, where's her 


That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

GREMIO: 
And may not young men die, as well as old?
 
BAPTISTA:
Well, gentlemen, 
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
My daughter Katharina is to be married:
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Be bride you, if you this assurance; 
If Signior Gremio: 
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.

GREMIO:
Adieu, good neighbour.
Now I fear thee not:
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool 
To give thee all, and in his waning age
Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
An old Italian is so kind, my boy. 

TRANIO:
A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
in my head do master 
see no but supposed Lucentio 
Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their in case of wooing, 
A child shall get a if I fail not of my cunning. 
 
LUCENTIO:
Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katharina welcomed withal? 
 
HORTENSIO: 
But, wrangling pedant, this is 
The patroness of heavenly harmony: 
Then give leave have prerogative; 
And when in music we have spent an hour,
lecture have leisure much. 
 
LUCENTIO: 
Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain'd! 
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause, serve in your harmony.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, will not these braves of thine. 

BIANCA:
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
strive for that resteth in my choice: 
I no scholar in schools; 
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times, 
But learn as I please 
to cut off all strife, we 
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

HORTENSIO:
leave his when I 

LUCENTIO:
That will be never: tune your instrument. 
 
BIANCA:
Where left we last?
 
LUCENTIO: 
madam: 
'Hic ibat Simois; hic tellus; 
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.' 

BIANCA:
Construe them. 

LUCENTIO: 
'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
'Hic steterat,' and comes 
a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'
bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that might 
beguile the old 

HORTENSIO:
Madam, my instrument's in tune. 

BIANCA: 
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
 
LUCENTIO:
Spit the man, and tune again. 

BIANCA:
let me see if I construe it: 'Hic 
Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
you not; heed 
hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, senis,' 
despair not. 

HORTENSIO: 
Madam, now tune. 

LUCENTIO:
All but 
 
HORTENSIO:
The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
How fiery and forward our pedant is! 
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love: 
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.

BIANCA: 
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

LUCENTIO:
Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
Was Ajax, call'd so from grandfather. 
 
BIANCA:
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters, take it not unkindly, 
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

HORTENSIO: 
You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
My lessons make no music in three parts. 

LUCENTIO:
Are you so formal, well, I must wait, 
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.
 
HORTENSIO:
Madam, before you touch the instrument,
To learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with rudiments of art; 
To teach you a briefer sort, 
More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.

BIANCA: 
Why, I am past my gamut long ago. 

HORTENSIO:
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
 

 
Servant:
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
And help dress sister's up: 
You know is the wedding-day. 
 
BIANCA:
Farewell, masters both; I must gone. 

LUCENTIO:
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay. 
 
HORTENSIO: 
But I have pry into this pedant: 
Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble 
To cast thy wandering on every stale, 
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.

BAPTISTA:
 
KATHARINA:
No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
To give my opposed against my heart 
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen; 
Who haste and means to wed leisure. 
I told you, he was a frantic fool, 
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
And, to be noted for a merry man,
He'll woo a 'point the day of marriage, 
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
Yet never wed he hath woo'd. 
Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
If it would please him and marry her!' 
 
TRANIO:
Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
Whatever fortune stays his 
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.


Would Katharina had never seen him though!


Go, girl; blame thee now weep; 
For such an injury would vex a very saint, 
Much a shrew of impatient 
 
BIONDELLO:
Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
you never heard of!

BAPTISTA:
and old too? how may be? 

BIONDELLO: 
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?
 
BAPTISTA:
Is he come?
 
BIONDELLO:
Why, no, sir.
 

What then? 

BIONDELLO:
is 

BAPTISTA: 
will he be 
 
BIONDELLO: 
When he stands I am and sees you there. 
 
TRANIO: 
But say, what to thine old news? 

BIONDELLO: 
Why, Petruchio coming a new and an old 
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
town-armory, with a broken and chapeless; 
with two broken his horse hipped 
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
the chine; lampass, infected 
with fashions, full sped with 
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark with staggers, begnawn with the 
bots, swayed in the and shoulder-shotten; 
near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been 
often burst and with knots; one girth 
time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure, 
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down 
in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.
 
BAPTISTA: 
Who comes with him?
 
BIONDELLO:
O, sir, his lackey, all the world 
like the horse; a on one leg and 
kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: monster, a 
very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.

TRANIO:
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd. 
 
BAPTISTA: 
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
 

Why, sir, he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
Didst thou not he comes? 

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio came?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, that Petruchio came.
 
BIONDELLO: 
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.

BAPTISTA:
Why, that's all one.
 
BIONDELLO:
Nay, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you a penny,
A horse and a man
Is more 
And yet not many.
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Come, where gallants? who's at home? 

BAPTISTA:
are welcome, 

PETRUCHIO: 
And yet I well. 

BAPTISTA:
And yet you halt not.

TRANIO:
so well apparell'd 
As wish you were. 

PETRUCHIO:
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or unusual prodigy?

BAPTISTA: 
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
Now sadder, that come so unprovided. 
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our festival! 
 
TRANIO:
And tells us, what occasion of import
Hath so long detain'd from wife, 
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?

PETRUCHIO: 
it were to and harsh to hear: 
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word, 
Though in some part enforced to digress;
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
The morning wears, we were at church. 

TRANIO:
See not your bride in these unreverent 
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
 
BAPTISTA: 
But you marry her. 


Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
Could I repair what she will wear in me,
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself. 
But what I to you, 
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
 

some meaning in his mad 
We persuade him, be it possible, 
To put on better ere he go to church.

BAPTISTA: 
I'll after him, and see the event of this.
 
TRANIO:
But to her love concerneth us to add
Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
As I before unparted to your worship,
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
And he shall be Vincentio Pisa; 
And make assurance here in Padua
Of greater sums than I have promised. 
So shall you quietly enjoy your 
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.

LUCENTIO:
Were it not that fellow-school-master 
watch Bianca's steps narrowly, 
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'll keep mine own, despite of all the 

TRANIO:
That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch our vantage in this business:
the greybeard, Gremio, 
narrow-prying father, 
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for my master's sake, 
Signior Gremio, came you from the church? 

GREMIO: 
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
 
TRANIO:
And the and bridegroom coming 

GREMIO:
A bridegroom say you? 'tis a indeed, 
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
 
TRANIO: 
Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.
 
GREMIO:
he's a devil, a a very fiend. 

TRANIO:
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
 
GREMIO:
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you, Sir when the priest 
Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' and swore loud, 
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall book; 
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'

TRANIO:
What said the wench he rose again? 

GREMIO: 
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
As if the vicar meant to cozen him. 
But after many ceremonies done, 
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, if 
He had aboard, carousing to his mates 
After a storm; quaff'd the muscadel 
And threw the sops all the sexton's 
Having no other reason 
But that his beard grew and hungerly 
And to ask him sops as was drinking. 
This he took the bride about the neck 
kiss'd lips with such a clamorous smack 
That at the parting all the church did echo:
And seeing this thence for very shame; 
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad marriage never was before:
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play. 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
and friends, I thank you for your pains: 
I know you think to dine with me to-day,
And have prepared great store of wedding cheer; 
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
 
BAPTISTA:
Is't possible you will away to-night?
 
PETRUCHIO:
I must away to-day, before come: 
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all,
That have beheld me give away myself
To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
Dine with my father, drink health to me; 
I must hence; and farewell to you all. 
 

Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
 
PETRUCHIO: 
It may not be.

GREMIO:
Let me entreat you. 

PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be.

KATHARINA:
me entreat 


I am content.
 
KATHARINA:
Are you content to stay?
 
PETRUCHIO:
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.

KATHARINA: 
if love stay. 
 

Grumio, my horse.

GRUMIO:
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.
 

Nay, then, 
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom, 
That take it on you at the first so roundly.
 

Kate, content thee; prithee, not angry. 

KATHARINA:
I will be angry: what hast thou do? 
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.

GREMIO: 
sir, now it begins to work. 
 
KATARINA:
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal 
I see a woman may be made a fool,
If she had not a spirit to resist. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey bride, you that attend on 
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
Be and merry, go hang yourselves: 
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me. 
Nay, not big, stamp, nor fret; 
I be master of what is mine own: 
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
My household stuff, 
My horse, ox, my ass, my any thing; 
here she stands, touch whoever dare; 
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio, 
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
Rescue mistress, if thou a man. 
Fear not, sweet they shall not touch 
thee, Kate: 
I'll thee against a million. 
 
BAPTISTA: 
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

GREMIO: 
Went they not quickly, should die with 
 

Of all mad matches never was the like. 

LUCENTIO:
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?

BIANCA:
being mad she's mated. 
 
GREMIO:
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated. 
 
BAPTISTA: 
and friends, bride 
bridegroom 
For to supply the places at the table,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:
And let Bianca take her 

TRANIO:
Shall to bride it? 
 
BAPTISTA: 
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.

GRUMIO:
Fie, fie on all tired on all mad masters, and 
all ways! Was ever man so was 
man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
before to make a fire, they are coming after to 
warm Now, not little pot and 
hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
considering the weather, a taller man than I will
Holla, Curtis. 

CURTIS:
Who is that calls so coldly?

GRUMIO: 
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide 
from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.

CURTIS:
Is my master and his wife coming, 

GRUMIO: 
O, ay, ay: and therefore fire, 
on no water. 
 
CURTIS: 
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported? 
 

She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
winter tames man, woman and beast; it 
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
myself, Curtis. 

CURTIS: 
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.

GRUMIO:
Am I but inches? thy horn is a foot; 
I at the least. But wilt thou make 
fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,
whose she being now at hand, thou shalt soon 
feel, to thy cold comfort, being slow in thy hot office? 
 
CURTIS: 
I prithee, tell how goes the 

GRUMIO: 
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.


There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.

GRUMIO:
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as 
will thaw. 
 
CURTIS:
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!

GRUMIO:
Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
Where's the is supper ready, the 
trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
serving-men in their new fustian, their white
stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
the carpets laid, and every thing in 

CURTIS:
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
 
GRUMIO:
First, know, my horse tired; my master and 
mistress fallen out.

CURTIS:
How?
 
GRUMIO:
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
hangs a tale.

CURTIS: 
Let's ha't, good Grumio.


Lend thine ear.

CURTIS:
Here.
 
GRUMIO:
There. 
 
CURTIS:
This feel tale, not to hear a 
 
GRUMIO:
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
listening. I begin: Imprimis, we came down a 
foul hill, my master riding mistress,-- 

CURTIS: 
Both of one horse?

GRUMIO: 
What's that to thee?

CURTIS:
a horse. 

GRUMIO:
Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she 
under her horse; thou heard in 
miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
with the horse her, how he beat me because 
her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I 
lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
which now shall in and thou return 
unexperienced grave. 

CURTIS:
this reckoning he is more shrew than she. 
 
GRUMIO:
Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
find when he comes home. But what talk I of this? 
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
of an indifferent knit: let them 
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their
hands. Are they 
 

They are.
 
GRUMIO: 
Call them forth.
 
CURTIS:
Do you hear, ho? you must my master to 
countenance my mistress.
 
GRUMIO:
Why, she hath a face of her own.

CURTIS: 
Who not that? 

GRUMIO:
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
countenance her.

CURTIS: 
I call forth to credit her. 
 
GRUMIO: 
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
 
NATHANIEL: 
Welcome Grumio! 
 
PHILIP: 
How now, Grumio!
 

What, Grumio! 
 
NICHOLAS: 
Fellow Grumio!

NATHANIEL:
How now, old lad? 

GRUMIO:
you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow, 
you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, 
companions, is all ready, and all things neat?
 
NATHANIEL: 
All is ready. How near is master? 
 

at alighted by this; and therefore be 
not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to my 
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, 
 
ALL 
Here, here, sir; here, sir.

PETRUCHIO: 
Here, here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! 
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
no regard? no duty? 
Where is the foolish knave I sent 
 
GRUMIO:
Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
 
PETRUCHIO:
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
I not bid thee me the park, 
And bring along these knaves thee? 
 
GRUMIO:
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel; 
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
Where is the life that late I led--
Where are and welcome.-- 
Sound, sound, 
Why, when, I say? Nay, sweet Kate, be merry. 
Off with my boots, you rogues! villains, when? 
It was the friar of 
As he forth walked on his way:--
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
And bid my cousin come hither: 
One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily. 
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?

KATHARINA: 
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
 
PETRUCHIO: 
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave! 
Come, I know you have a stomach. 
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
What's this? mutton?
 
First Servant: 
Ay. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
brought it? 

PETER:

 
PETRUCHIO: 
burnt; and so is all the meat. 
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
durst you, villains, bring the dresser, 
And serve thus to me that love not? 
Theretake it to you, cups, and all; 
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
you grumble? I'll be with you straight. 
 
KATHARINA: 
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
meat was well, were so contented. 

PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away; 
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better 'twere both of us did fast, 
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be to-morrow 't be mended, 
And, this night, we'll fast company: 
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.

NATHANIEL:
Peter, didst ever see the like?

PETER: 
He kills her in her 

GRUMIO:
Where he? 

CURTIS: 
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
And rails, and swears, and she, poor soul, 
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak, 
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.
 
PETRUCHIO:
Thus have politicly begun my 
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon is sharp and passing empty; 
And till she stoop she must be full-gorged, 
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I to man my 
To make her come and know her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat none shall eat; 
she slept nor to-night she shall not; 
with the undeserved fault 
find about the making of the bed; 
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend care of her;
And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
This is way to kill a wife with kindness; 
And thus curb mad and headstrong humour. 
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

TRANIO: 
Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress 
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

HORTENSIO: 
Sir, you in what I have said, 
by and mark the manner of his 
 
LUCENTIO: 
Now, profit you in what read? 
 
BIANCA:
What, master, read you? first resolve me that.

LUCENTIO: 
I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
 
BIANCA: 
And may you prove, master of art! 

LUCENTIO:
you, dear, prove mistress my heart! 

HORTENSIO: 
Quick marry! me, I pray, 
You that durst at your mistress Bianca 
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.

TRANIO:
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind! 
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I seem to be; 
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
a god of such cullion: 
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio. 
 
TRANIO:
Signior I have heard 
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness, 
I will with you, if you be so contented, 
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO:
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, here I firmly vow 
to woo no more, but do forswear her, 
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have withal. 

TRANIO:
And here I take the 
Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
Fie on her! how beastly she court him! 

HORTENSIO:
all the world he had quite forsworn! 
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath, 
I will be married wealthy widow, 
Ere three days pass, hath as long loved 
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Lucentio. 
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before.

TRANIO: 
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth a blessed case! 
Nay, I napping, 
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
 

Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?
 
TRANIO:
Mistress, we have.
 
LUCENTIO:
are rid Licio. 

TRANIO: 
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be wood and wedded in a day.

BIANCA:
God give him joy!
 
TRANIO: 
Ay, and he'll tame her.
 
BIANCA: 
He says so, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.

BIANCA: 
The taming-school! what, is there such a place? 
 
TRANIO: 
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master; 
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
tame shrew and charm her chattering tongue. 
 
BIONDELLO: 
O master, master, I have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
An angel coming the hill, 
Will serve the turn. 
 
TRANIO:
What is he, Biondello? 

BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I know not what; but format in apparel,
In gait and surely 

LUCENTIO: 
what of him, 
 
TRANIO: 
If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I'll glad to seem 
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
As if he were the right Vincentio
Take in your love, and then let me alone.
 
Pedant: 
God save you, sir!

TRANIO:
And you, sir! you are welcome. 
Travel you far or are you at farthest? 

Pedant:
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if life. 
 

What countryman, I pray?
 
Pedant: 
Mantua. 

TRANIO: 
Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of your life?

Pedant:
My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.


'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to you the cause? 
Your ships are stay'd at and the duke, 
For private 'twixt your duke and him, 
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else 
 
Pedant: 
it is than so; 
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and must deliver 

TRANIO:
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I do, and this I will advise you:
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

Pedant:
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens. 

TRANIO:
Among them know you Vincentio? 
 
Pedant: 
know not, but I have heard of him; 
A merchant wealth. 
 
TRANIO:
He is my father, sir; sooth say, 
In countenance somewhat you. 

BIONDELLO:

TRANIO: 
To save your life in this extremity,
This favour I do for his sake; 
And it not the worst of fortunes 
That you are like Sir Vincentio. 
His name shall you undertake, 
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
Look that you take upon you as you should;
You understand me, sir: so shall stay 
Till you have done your business in the city:
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.

Pedant:
O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.

TRANIO:
Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand;
my father is here look'd for every day,
To pass assurance of a dower in 
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

GRUMIO:
No, forsooth; I dare my 
 
KATHARINA:
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
What, marry me to famish me? 
that come my father's door, 
Upon entreaty have aims; 
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Nor that I entreat, 
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
that me than all wants, 
does under name perfect love; 
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat, 
deadly sickness else present death. 
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I not what, so it be wholesome food. 


What say you to a neat's foot?
 
KATHARINA: 
passing good: I prithee let me have it. 
 
GRUMIO: 
I fear is too choleric a meat. 
How say you to a fat broil'd? 

KATHARINA:
I like it well: good fetch it 
 
GRUMIO:
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?

KATHARINA:
A dish that I do love to feed upon.

GRUMIO: 
Ay, but the mustard is a little. 
 
KATHARINA: 
Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.

GRUMIO: 
Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
 
KATHARINA:
Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt. 
 
GRUMIO:
Why then, mustard the beef. 
 
KATHARINA: 
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
That feed'st me with the very of meat: 
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
That triumph thus upon my misery!
Go, get thee gone, I say. 

PETRUCHIO:
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

HORTENSIO:
Mistress, what cheer?

KATHARINA: 
as cold as can be. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am 
dress thy meat and bring it thee: 
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this dish.

KATHARINA: 
I pray you, let it stand.
 
PETRUCHIO:
The poorest service is repaid with thanks; 
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
 

I thank you, sir.
 
HORTENSIO: 
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame. 
Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.

PETRUCHIO:

Haberdasher:
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy: 
Why, 'tis or a walnut-shell, 
A knack, a toy, trick, a baby's cap: 
Away with it! come, me have a bigger. 

KATHARINA:
I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these 

PETRUCHIO: 
When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
And not till then.

HORTENSIO:
 
KATHARINA:
Why, sir, I trust I may have to 
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop ears. 
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart concealing it will break,
And rather than it shall, I will be free
Even to uttermost, I please, words. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
Why, thou true; it is a paltry cap, 
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie: 
love well, that thou it not. 
 
KATHARINA:
Love me or love me not, I like the 
And it will have, or I will have 

PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us 
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
What's a sleeve? 'tis like demi-cannon: 
What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
snip and nip and cut and slish slash, 
Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?

HORTENSIO: 

Tailor:
bid me make it orderly and well, 
to the fashion and time. 

PETRUCHIO: 
Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
hop me over every home, 
For you hop without sir: 
I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.

KATHARINA:
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
Belike you to make a puppet of me. 

PETRUCHIO:
Why, he means make a thee. 

Tailor: 
says worship means to make 
a puppet of her.

PETRUCHIO:
O monstrous Thou liest, thou 
thou thimble, 
yard, half-yard, quarter, nail! 
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard 
As shalt think on prating whilst thou livest! 
I tell thee, hast marr'd her 

Tailor:
Your worship is deceived; the gown is made
Just my master 
Grumio gave it should be 

GRUMIO:
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff. 

Tailor:
But how did you desire it should be made?

GRUMIO: 
Marry, sir, with needle and thread. 
 
Tailor:
But did you not request to cut? 

GRUMIO:
Thou hast faced many things.

Tailor: 
I have. 

GRUMIO:
Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
I neither braved. I say unto 
I bid thy cut out the gown; but I did 
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.
 
Tailor: 
Why, here is the note of to testify 

PETRUCHIO: 
Read it. 
 
GRUMIO:
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so. 

Tailor:

GRUMIO: 
Master, if ever I loose-bodied gown, sew 
the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom
of brown thread: I said a gown.

PETRUCHIO: 
Proceed. 

Tailor: 

GRUMIO: 
I confess the cape.
 
Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess two sleeves.
 
Tailor: 
 
PETRUCHIO:
there's the villany. 

GRUMIO: 
Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out 
sewed up and that prove thee, 
though thy little be armed in a thimble. 
 
Tailor: 
is true that I say: an had thee 
in place where, thou shouldst know it.


I am for thee straight: take thou the
bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.
 
HORTENSIO: 
God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
 
GRUMIO:
You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
 
GRUMIO:
Villain, not for thy life: my mistress' 
gown for thy master's use! 
 
PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, what's your in that? 

GRUMIO:
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
O, fie, fie, fie!

PETRUCHIO: 

HORTENSIO:
Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown 
Take unkindness of his hasty words: 
Away! I say; commend me to thy master.


Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's 
Even in these honest mean habiliments:
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
For the mind that makes the body rich; 
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, 
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
What is the jay more precious than the lark,
Because his fathers are more beautiful?
Or is the adder better than the eel,
his painted skin contents the eye? 
O, art thou the worse 
For this poor furniture and array. 
if it shame. lay it on 
And frolic: we will hence forthwith, 
To feast and sport us at thy house. 
Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
And our horses unto Long-lane end; 
There will we walk on 
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well come by 

KATHARINA:
I dare assure you, sir, almost two; 
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.

PETRUCHIO: 
It be ere I go to 
what I speak, or or think to do, 
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
It be what I it is. 
 
HORTENSIO: 
 
TRANIO: 
Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?

Pedant:
Ay, what else? and but I be deceived 
Signior Baptista may remember 
Near twenty ago, Genoa, 
Where we were lodgers at Pegasus. 


'Tis well; and hold your in 
With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
 
Pedant:
I warrant you. 
But, sir, here comes your boy; 
'Twere good were school'd. 
 
TRANIO: 
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now your throughly, advise you: 
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.

BIONDELLO: 
Tut, not me. 

TRANIO: 
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
 
BIONDELLO: 
I told him that was at Venice, 
you look'd for him this day in 

TRANIO:
Thou'rt a tall hold thee that to drink. 
Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir. 
Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
Sir, this is gentleman I told of: 
I pray you good to now, 
Give me for my patrimony. 

Pedant: 
Soft son!
by your having come to Padua 
in some debts, my son Lucentio 
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself:
And, the I hear you 
And the love he to your daughter 
And she to him, to stay not long, 
I am content, in a good father's care,
To have him match'd; and if you please to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
shall you find and willing 
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
For curious I with 
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
 
BAPTISTA: 
pardon me in what I have to say: 
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
true it is, your son Lucentio 
Doth love daughter she him, 
Or dissemble deeply affections: 
And therefore, you no more than this, 
That like a father will deal with him 
And pass my daughter a dower, 
The match is made, and all is done:
Your son shall have my daughter with 
 
TRANIO:
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know 
We be affied and such assurance ta'en
As shall with either part's agreement stand?
 
BAPTISTA:
Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
And happily we might be interrupted.

TRANIO:
Then at lodging, an it like you: 
doth my father and there, this night, 
We'll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here: 
My boy shall fetch scrivener presently. 
The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
 
BAPTISTA:
It likes me well. Biondello, hie you 
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
how she's to be Lucentio's wife. 
 
BIONDELLO:
I pray the gods may all heart! 


not with the gods, but get thee gone. 
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:
Come, will it in Pisa. 

BAPTISTA:
I follow you. 
 
BIONDELLO:
Cambio!

LUCENTIO: 
What sayest thou, Biondello? 


You saw my master wink you? 
 
LUCENTIO:
Biondello, what of 
 
BIONDELLO:
Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to 
expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.

LUCENTIO: 
I pray thee, moralize them.
 
BIONDELLO: 
Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
deceiving father of a deceitful 

LUCENTIO: 
And what of him?

BIONDELLO: 
daughter is to brought by you to supper. 

LUCENTIO: 
And then?
 
BIONDELLO: 
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
command at all hours.
 
LUCENTIO:
And what of all this?

BIONDELLO: 
I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to 
church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
I have to say, But bid Bianca farewell for 
ever and a day.
 
LUCENTIO: 
Hearest thou, 

BIONDELLO:
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu, 
sir. hath me go Saint 
Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
come with appendix. 
 
LUCENTIO:
I may, and will, if she be so contented:
She will pleased; then wherefore should doubt? 
Hap what hap I'll roundly go about her: 
shall go hard if Cambio go her. 

PETRUCHIO: 
on, i' God's once toward our father's. 
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon! 

KATHARINA: 
The the sun: it not moonlight now. 

PETRUCHIO: 
I say is moon so 

KATHARINA:
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
 
PETRUCHIO:
by my mother's and that's myself, 
It shall be moon, star, or I list, 
Or ere I journey your father's house. 
on, fetch our horses back 
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!

HORTENSIO: 
Say as he says, or we shall never go.
 
KATHARINA: 
Forward, I since we have come so far, 
And be moon, or what 
An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
Henceforth I vow shall be so me. 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
I say it is the moon.

KATHARINA: 
I know it is the moon. 

PETRUCHIO: 
Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.

KATHARINA: 
God bless'd, it is the blessed sun: 
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
the moon changes even as 
What you will have it named, even that it is;
And so it shall be so for 

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, forward, thus the should run, 
And not unluckily against the bias.
But, soft! company is coming here.
Good morrow, gentle away? 
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
Such war of white and red within her cheeks! 
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
As those two become that heavenly face? 
Fair lovely maid, once more good day thee. 
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.


A' make the man mad, make woman of him. 
 
KATHARINA: 
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh sweet, 
Whither away, or where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair a child;
Happier the man, whom favourable stars
Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!

PETRUCHIO: 
Why, how now, I hope art not mad: 
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.
 
KATHARINA:
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes, 
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green:
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
Pardon, pray for my mad mistaking. 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known 
Which thou if with us, 
We shall be joyful of thy company.

VINCENTIO:
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
That with encounter much amazed me, 
My name is call'd Vincentio; my Pisa; 
And bound I am to Padua; there to visit 
A mine, which long I have not seen. 

PETRUCHIO:
What is his name?
 
VINCENTIO: 
Lucentio, gentle sir.
 
PETRUCHIO: 
Happily we met; the son. 
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle loving father: 
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
Thy son by this married. Wonder 
Nor be grieved: of esteem, 
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
so may 
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
wander we to thy honest son, 
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

VINCENTIO:
But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake?
 
HORTENSIO: 
I do assure thee, father, it is. 

PETRUCHIO:
Come, go along, and truth hereof; 
For first merriment hath made thee 

HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Have to my widow! be 
Then hast thou taught Hortensio be untoward. 


Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.

LUCENTIO:
I Biondello: but they may chance to need thee 
at home; therefore leave us.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, I'll see the church o' your back; and 
then come back to my master's as soon as I can.

GREMIO:
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
 
PETRUCHIO:
Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
My bears more toward the market-place; 
must here I leave you, sir. 

VINCENTIO: 
You shall not but drink before you go: 
I shall your 
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.

GREMIO: 
They're busy within; you were best knock louder.


he that knocks as beat down gate? 

VINCENTIO:
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?

Pedant: 
He's within, sir, but not be spoken withal. 

VINCENTIO:
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
make merry withal? 
 
Pedant: 
Keep your hundred pounds to he shall 
need none, so long as I live.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is 
come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.
 
Pedant: 
Thou liest: his father is come from and here 
looking out at window. 

VINCENTIO:
Art thou his father?

Pedant:
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.

PETRUCHIO: 
 
Pedant:
Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
cozen somebody this city under my countenance. 

BIONDELLO:
I have seen them in the church together: God send
'em good shipping! who is mine old 
Vincentio! now are undone and brought nothing. 
 
VINCENTIO: 
 
BIONDELLO:
Hope I choose, sir. 

VINCENTIO: 
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?

BIONDELLO:
Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
never saw you before in all my life.
 
VINCENTIO:
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
thy master's father, Vincentio? 

BIONDELLO: 
What, my old worshipful old master? yes, sir: 
see where out window. 

VINCENTIO: 
Is't 
 
BIONDELLO:
help, here's a madman will murder 

Pedant: 
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista! 

PETRUCHIO: 
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of 
controversy. 

TRANIO:
what are you that offer to beat my servant? 

VINCENTIO:
What am I, sir! nay, what you, sir? O immortal 
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
hose! a cloak! a copatain hat! O, I 
am am undone! while I play the 
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
the university.

TRANIO:
How now! what's the 
 

is man lunatic? 

TRANIO:
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
habit, but your words you a madman. Why, sir, 
'cerns it you if wear pearl and gold? I 
thank my father, I am able to maintain it. 

VINCENTIO: 
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

BAPTISTA:
You mistake, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do 
you think is his name? 

VINCENTIO:
His as if I knew not name: I have brought 
him up ever since he three old, his 
name is Tranio.

Pedant:
Away, away, mad his is Lucentio and he 
mine only and heir to the lands Vincentio. 

VINCENTIO:
Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
son, my son! Tell thou villain, is my son Lucentio? 
 
TRANIO: 
Call forth an officer. 
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
I charge you see that he 

VINCENTIO:
Carry me to the gaol!
 
GREMIO:
officer: he shall go to 
 
BAPTISTA: 
Talk not, Gremio: I say he shall go to prison. 
 

Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
is Vincentio. 

Pedant:
Swear, if thou darest.
 
GREMIO:
Nay, I dare not swear it.

TRANIO: 
Then best say that I am not Lucentio. 
 
GREMIO:
know Signior Lucentio. 


Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
 

Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
monstrous villain!

BIONDELLO: 
O! we spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him, 
him, or we are all undone. 

LUCENTIO:
 
VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet son? 

BIANCA: 
dear father. 

BAPTISTA: 
How hast offended? 
Where Lucentio? 
 
LUCENTIO:
Here's Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio; 
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While supposes bleared thine eyne. 

GREMIO: 
Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!

VINCENTIO:
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me this matter 

BAPTISTA: 
tell me, is this my Cambio? 

BIANCA: 
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange state Tranio, 
While he did my countenance the town; 
And happily have arrived at the last 
the wished haven my 
What Tranio myself enforced him to; 
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

VINCENTIO: 
I'll slit villain's nose, that have sent 
me to the gaol.

BAPTISTA:
But do you hear, sir? have you married my 
without asking good will? 
 
VINCENTIO: 
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged for this villany. 
 
BAPTISTA: 
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
 

Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.


cake is dough; but in among the rest, 
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
 
KATHARINA: 
Husband, let's follow, to see the of this ado. 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

KATHARINA: 
What, in the midst of the street?

PETRUCHIO: 
What, art thou ashamed of me?

KATHARINA: 
sir, God forbid; but to kiss. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.

KATHARINA:
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, 

PETRUCHIO:
Is not this well? my sweet Kate: 
once than never, for never late. 

LUCENTIO:
At last, long, jarring agree: 
And time it is, when raging war is done,
To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine. 
Brother sister Katharina, 
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
Feast with the best, and to my house: 
My banquet is close our stomachs 
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
 
PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat! 

BAPTISTA:
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.

PETRUCHIO: 
Padua affords nothing is kind. 

HORTENSIO:
For both our I would that 
 
PETRUCHIO:
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his 
 
Widow:
Then never me, if be 

PETRUCHIO:
You are sensible, and yet you miss my sense: 
I mean, Hortensio is afeard 

Widow:
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.

PETRUCHIO:
Roundly replied.
 

Mistress, how you that? 

Widow:
Thus I conceive by him.

PETRUCHIO: 
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
 

My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.

PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow. 

KATHARINA: 
'He that giddy thinks the world turns round:' 
I you, what you meant by 

Widow: 
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
And now you my meaning, 

KATHARINA: 
A very mean meaning.

Widow:
Right, I mean you.
 
KATHARINA:
I am mean indeed, respecting you. 

PETRUCHIO: 
To her, Kate!

HORTENSIO:
To her, widow!

PETRUCHIO:
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
 
HORTENSIO: 
That's my office.
 
PETRUCHIO:
Spoke like ha' to thee, lad! 

BAPTISTA:
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
 
GREMIO: 
Believe me, sir, butt together 

BIANCA: 
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
say your head and butt head horn. 

VINCENTIO:
Ay, mistress that awaken'd you? 

BIANCA:
Ay, frighted me; therefore I'll again. 

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun, 
Have at you for bitter or two! 

BIANCA:
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome 


She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
Therefore a health all that shot and 

TRANIO: 
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
Which runs himself and catches for 

PETRUCHIO: 
A good swift simile, but something currish. 
 
TRANIO:
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.


O Petruchio! Tranio hits you now. 

LUCENTIO:
I thank thee for that good 

HORTENSIO:
Confess, confess, hath hit you here? 


A' has gall'd me, I 
And, as jest did glance away from me, 
'Tis ten to one you 
 
BAPTISTA: 
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, 
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
Let's one send unto his wife; 
And he whose wife is most obedient
To come at first when he doth for her, 
Shall win which we will propose. 

HORTENSIO:
Content. What is the wager?
 
LUCENTIO: 
Twenty crowns.

PETRUCHIO:
crowns! 
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
But twenty times so much upon my wife.

LUCENTIO: 
A hundred then.
 
HORTENSIO: 
Content. 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
A match! 'tis done.

HORTENSIO: 
Who shall begin?
 
LUCENTIO:
That will I.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
 
BIONDELLO: 
I go.


Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.
 
LUCENTIO: 
no I'll bear it all myself. 
now! news? 

BIONDELLO:
Sir, my mistress sends you word
That she busy and she cannot come. 
 
PETRUCHIO: 
How! she is busy and she cannot come!
Is that an answer?

GREMIO: 
Ay, and a kind one too: 
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse. 

PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.
 
HORTENSIO:
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith. 

PETRUCHIO:
O, ho! entreat her! 
then she must needs 

HORTENSIO:
I am afraid, sir, 
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
Now, where's my wife? 
 
BIONDELLO: 
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
She will come: she bids you come to her. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
Intolerable, not to be 
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress; 
Say, her to come to me. 

HORTENSIO:
I know her answer.

PETRUCHIO:
What? 

HORTENSIO:
She will not. 
 
PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune mine, and an 

BAPTISTA: 
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!

KATHARINA: 
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?

PETRUCHIO:
Where is your Hortensio's wife? 

KATHARINA: 
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.

PETRUCHIO: 
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.

LUCENTIO:
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.

HORTENSIO:
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes. 

PETRUCHIO: 
Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
And rule and right supremacy; 
And, to be short, what not, that's and happy? 

BAPTISTA:
Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another daughter, 
For she is changed, as she had never been.

PETRUCHIO: 
Nay, I will win my wager better yet
And show more sign of her obedience, 
Her new-built virtue obedience. 
See where she comes and brings your froward wives
prisoners her womanly persuasion. 
Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.
 
Widow: 
let me never to sigh, 
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!

BIANCA:
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
 
LUCENTIO:
I would your duty were as foolish too:
The of your fair 
Hath cost an crowns supper-time. 

BIANCA:
The more fool you, for laying on my duty.
 
PETRUCHIO:
Katharina, I charge tell these headstrong women 
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
 
Widow: 
Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.


on, I say; and first with 


She shall not.
 
PETRUCHIO:
I say she shall: and first begin with her.

KATHARINA:
Fie, fie! unkind brow, 
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
blots thy beauty as frosts do meads, 
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman moved is like fountain troubled, 
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of 
And it is so, none or thirsty 
Will deign sip or one drop of it. 
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy thy sovereign; one that cares for thee, 
And for thy maintenance commits his body 
To painful labour both by sea and land, 
watch the night in day in cold, 
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks and true obedience;
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince 
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will, 
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
I ashamed that are so simple 
To offer war where they should kneel for 
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
When they are bound serve, and 
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts? 
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My mind been big as one of yours, 
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as our weakness compare, 
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your for it is no boot, 
And place your hands below your husband's foot:
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

PETRUCHIO: 
Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.

LUCENTIO: 
Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.
 
VINCENTIO: 
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
 
LUCENTIO:
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

PETRUCHIO: 
we'll bed. 
We three are married, but you two are sped.
'Twas I won the though you hit the white; 
being a winner, God give you good 
 
HORTENSIO: 
Now, go thy ways; hast tamed a curst 

LUCENTIO:
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, will be tamed so. 


Boatswain! 

Boatswain:
Here, master: cheer? 
 
Master:
Good, speak the mariners: fall to't, yarely, 
we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir. 
 
Boatswain:
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, my hearts! 
yare, yare! Take the topsail. Tend to the 
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
room enough! 


Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? 
Play the men.
 
Boatswain: 
pray now, keep below. 
 
ANTONIO: 
Where is the master, boatswain?
 
Boatswain:
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
cabins: you do assist the storm.

GONZALO: 
Nay, good, be patient. 

Boatswain:
the sea is. Hence! What these 
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
 
GONZALO: 
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

Boatswain: 
None that I more love than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cannot, you have so long, and make 
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
if it so Cheerly, hearts! Out 
of our way, I say.


I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
hath no drowning upon him; his complexion is 
perfect gallows. Stand to his 
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
for our own doth little If he 
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
 
Boatswain:
Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
her to try with main-course.
A upon this howling! they louder than 
the weather or our office.
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
drown? Have you a mind to sink? 
 
SEBASTIAN:
A throat, you bawling, 
incharitable dog!
 
Boatswain:
Work you then. 

ANTONIO:
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! 
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.


I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
no stronger than a and as as an 
unstanched wench.
 
Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.

Mariners: 
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost! 

Boatswain: 
What, must our mouths be cold?


The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
our case is theirs. 
 

I'm out of 

ANTONIO:
We are merely of our by drunkards: 
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides! 


He'll be hang'd 
Though every drop of water swear it 
And gape widest to him. 

ANTONIO:
Let's all with the 

SEBASTIAN:
take leave of him. 

GONZALO: 
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills be but I would 
die a dry death.
 
MIRANDA: 
If by your art, my dearest have 
the wild waters this roar, allay them. 
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Who had, creature her, 
all to pieces. O, the cry knock 
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd. 
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.

PROSPERO:
Be collected: 
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
There's harm done. 

MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!
 
PROSPERO:
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, my who 
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Prospero, master of a full poor cell, 
And thy no greater father. 
 
MIRANDA: 
More to know 
Did never meddle with my thoughts.

PROSPERO: 

I inform farther. thy hand, 
And pluck my magic from me. So: 
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
spectacle the wreck, which 
The very virtue compassion in 
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no soul--
not so perdition as an hair 
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
For thou must now know farther. 
 
MIRANDA: 
You have often 
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd 
And me to a bootless 
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

PROSPERO: 
The hour's now come;
The minute ope thine ear; 
and be attentive. Canst thou 
A time before we came unto this cell? 
do for thou wast not 
Out years old. 

MIRANDA: 
Certainly, sir, I can. 
 
PROSPERO: 
By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing the image tell that 
Hath kept with thy remembrance. 

MIRANDA:
'Tis far off 
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not 
Four or women once that tended me? 
 

Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark backward abysm time? 
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here, 
How camest here mayst. 

MIRANDA: 
But that I do not.

PROSPERO:
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
not you my father? 

PROSPERO:
Thy mother was a piece of 
She said my daughter; and thy father 
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
princess worse issued. 
 
MIRANDA: 
O the heavens!
foul play had we, that we came from thence? 
Or blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO:
Both, both, my girl:
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
But blessedly holp hither.


O, my heart bleeds
the that I have turn'd you to, 
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.

PROSPERO: 
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
so whom 
Of all the world I loved and to him 
The manage of my state; as at that time
Through all the signories it was the first
Prospero the prime being so reputed 
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a those being all my 
The government I cast upon my brother 
And to my state grew stranger, being 
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle-- 
Dost thou attend 

MIRANDA: 
Sir, most heedfully.
 

Being once perfected how to grant suits,
to deny them, who to advance who 
over-topping, new created 
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
To tune pleased his ear; he was 
ivy which had hid my princely trunk, 
And my verdure out on't. Thou 
 
MIRANDA:
O, good sir, I do.

PROSPERO: 
I pray thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
closeness the bettering of my 
With that which, but by being so retired,
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother 
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
Like a good parent, beget of 
A falsehood its contrary great 
As my was; which had indeed limit, 
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not only with what my revenue 
But what my power might else exact, like one
having into truth, telling of it, 
Made such a sinner of his memory,
To his own lie, he did 
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution 
And executing outward face of royalty, 
With hence his ambition growing-- 
Dost thou hear? 

MIRANDA:
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

PROSPERO:
To have no screen between this part he play'd
And it for, he 
Milan. Me, poor man, my library 
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties 
He thinks now incapable; confederates-- 
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples 
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject coronet to his crown and bend 
The dukedom yet Milan!-- 
To most ignoble stooping.

MIRANDA: 
O the heavens!

PROSPERO:
Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
If this might be a brother. 
 
MIRANDA:
sin 
To think nobly my 
Good wombs have borne bad sons. 
 
PROSPERO:
the 
The of Naples, being an enemy 
To inveterate, my brother's suit; 
was, that in lieu o' the 
Of homage I know not how much 
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Out of dukedom and fair Milan 
With all the honours my brother: whereon, 
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.
 
MIRANDA:
for pity! 
remembering how cried out then, 
cry it is hint 
That wrings mine eyes to't.

PROSPERO: 
Hear a little further
And then I'll bring thee to the present business
Which now's upon's; without the which this story
Were most 

MIRANDA: 
Wherefore did they not 
That hour destroy us? 

PROSPERO:
Well demanded, wench: 
My tale provokes question. Dear, they durst 
So dear the my bore nor set 
A mark so bloody on the business, but
With colours fairer painted their foul 
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
us leagues to sea; they 
rotten carcass of boat, not rigg'd, 
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Instinctively quit it: there they hoist us, 
To to the sea roar'd to us, sigh 
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
Did us but wrong. 

MIRANDA:
Alack, what 
I then to you! 
 
PROSPERO:
O, a cherubim
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised me 
An undergoing stomach, to up 
Against what should ensue.

MIRANDA:
How came we ashore?

PROSPERO: 
By Providence divine.
Some food had some fresh that 
A noble 
of his charity, then appointed 
Master design, did give us, with 
Rich garments, linens, necessaries, 
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
Knowing books, he furnish'd 
From mine own library volumes that 
I prize above my dukedom.

MIRANDA:
Would 
see that man! 
 
PROSPERO:
Now I arise:
Sit still, and hear the last of our 
Here in island we arrived; and here 
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
Than other princesses can that have more time
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
 
MIRANDA: 
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I you, sir, 
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm?

PROSPERO:
Know thus far forth.
By most bountiful Fortune, 
my dear hath mine enemies 
Brought this shore; and by prescience 
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
Thou to sleep; 'tis good dulness, 
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.

ARIEL:
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come 
To answer best to fly, 
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.

PROSPERO: 
Hast thou, spirit, 
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
 
ARIEL: 
To every article.
I boarded ship; now on the beak, 
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
And in many places; on the topmast, 
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors 
O' the thunder-claps, momentary 
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

PROSPERO:
My brave 
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Would not infect his reason?
 
ARIEL:
Not a soul 
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Was the man cried, is 
And all the devils are here.'

PROSPERO: 
that's my spirit! 
But was not this nigh 

ARIEL: 
Close my master. 
 
PROSPERO:
But are they, Ariel, 


Not a hair perish'd; 
On sustaining garments not a 
fresher than before: as thou badest me, 
troops I dispersed them the isle. 
The king's son have I landed 
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

PROSPERO: 
Of king's ship 
The mariners say how thou hast disposed
And all the rest o' the fleet.
 
ARIEL: 
Safely in harbour
king's ship; the deep nook, where once 
call'dst me up at to fetch dew 
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
have left asleep; and for o' the fleet 
Which I they all met again 
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing they saw the ship wreck'd 
And his great person perish.

PROSPERO:
Ariel, thy charge 
Exactly is there's more work. 
What is the o' the day? 

ARIEL:
Past the mid season.

PROSPERO:
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
Must by us both be spent most preciously. 
 
ARIEL:
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, 
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
Which is not yet perform'd me. 

PROSPERO:
How now? moody? 
What is't 

ARIEL:
My liberty. 

PROSPERO: 
Before the time be out? no more! 
 

I prithee,
Remember I done thee service; 
Told thee no made thee no mistakings, served 
grudge grumblings: thou didst promise 
To bate me a full year.

PROSPERO: 
Dost thou forget
From what a torment I did free thee?

ARIEL: 
No. 

PROSPERO: 
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do business in the veins o' the 
When is baked with frost. 

ARIEL: 
I do not, sir. 

PROSPERO:
Thou liest, malignant Hast 
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop? hast forgot her? 
 

No, 

PROSPERO: 
Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.

ARIEL:
Sir, Argier. 
 
PROSPERO: 
O, was she so? I must 
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
Which thou forget'st. damn'd witch Sycorax, 
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing, from Argier, 
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one she did 
They would not take her life. Is not this true?
 
ARIEL:
Ay, sir.

PROSPERO: 
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers 
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd thou didst painfully 
A dozen years; which space she died 
left there; where thou didst thy groans 
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
Save for the son that she did litter here,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
A shape. 

ARIEL:
Yes, Caliban her son. 

PROSPERO:
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
Whom now in Thou best know'st 
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
not again undo: it was mine art, 
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The pine and let thee 

ARIEL: 
I thank thee, master. 
 
PROSPERO:
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast away winters. 
 
ARIEL:
Pardon, master; 
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spiriting 

PROSPERO: 
two days 
will discharge thee. 
 
ARIEL:
That's my noble master! 
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?
 
PROSPERO:
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!
 
MIRANDA: 
The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.
 
PROSPERO:
Shake it off. Come on;
We'll Caliban my slave, who never 
Yields us kind answer.

MIRANDA:
'Tis a villain, sir,
I do not love to look on.
 
PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis, 
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood and in offices 
That profit us. ho! slave! 
Thou earth, thou! speak.
 


PROSPERO:
Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
Come, thou tortoise! when? 
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
Hark in thine ear.
 
ARIEL: 
My lord it shall be done.

PROSPERO:
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth! 


As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome 
on you both! a south-west blow on ye 
And blister you all o'er!


this, be to-night thou shalt cramps, 
Side-stitches shall pen thy breath 
Shall, for that vast night that work, 
All exercise on thou shalt pinch'd 
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
that made 'em. 

CALIBAN: 
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and madest of me, wouldst give 
with teach me how 
To name the bigger light, and how the less, 
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
show'd thee all the qualities o' isle, 
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, bats, light on you! 
For I am all the subjects that you have, 
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' the island.

PROSPERO:
Thou most lying slave,
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I used thee, 
Filth thou art, human lodged thee 
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my child.

CALIBAN: 
O ho, ho! would't had been done! 
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle Calibans. 
 
PROSPERO:

Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
pains to make thee thee each hour 
One thing or other: when not, savage, 
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
good natures 
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confined this rock, 
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

CALIBAN: 
You taught me language; and my profit on't
Is, I know plague rid you 
For learning your language! 
 
PROSPERO: 
hence! 
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll rack with old cramps, 
thy bones with make thee 
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
 
CALIBAN:
No, pray thee.
I must obey: his art is of such power, 
would control my dam's god, Setebos, 
a vassal of him. 

PROSPERO: 
So, slave; hence! 
Come these yellow sands, 
And then take hands: 
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
The wild waves 
it featly here and there; 
And, sweet sprites, burthen bear. 
Hark, hark! 
 
FERDINAND:
Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade 
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into rich and strange. 
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell 
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

FERDINAND:
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
This is no mortal business, nor sound 
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
And say what thou seest yond.
 
MIRANDA:
What a spirit? 
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.

PROSPERO: 
No, wench; it eats and and hath such senses 
As we have, such. gallant which thou seest 
Was in the wreck; and, he's something stain'd 
With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst him 
A person: he hath his fellows 
And strays about to find 'em.

MIRANDA: 
I might call 
A thing divine, natural 
I ever saw so noble.
 
PROSPERO: 
 
FERDINAND: 
Most sure, the goddess
On whom attend! Vouchsafe my prayer 
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here: request, 
Which I do last pronounce, O you wonder! 
If you be maid or no?
 
MIRANDA:
No wonder, sir;
But a maid. 

FERDINAND: 
My language! heavens!
I am the best them speak this speech, 
Were I but where 'tis spoken.
 
PROSPERO:
How? the best?
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
 
FERDINAND:
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders 
of Naples. He does hear me; 
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
with mine eyes, never since at beheld 
The king my father wreck'd.
 
MIRANDA:
Alack, for mercy!
 
FERDINAND: 
Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain.
 
PROSPERO: 

MIRANDA:
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way!

FERDINAND: 
O, a virgin, 
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
The queen of Naples.

PROSPERO:
Soft, sir! more. 
They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light.
One word more; I charge thee
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
name thou owest not; and hast put thyself 
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
From me, the lord on't.
 
FERDINAND:
No, as I am a 


There's ill can dwell in such a temple: 
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell with't.
 
PROSPERO:
Follow 
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

FERDINAND: 
No;
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more 
 
MIRANDA: 
O dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
gentle and not 

PROSPERO: 
What? I say, 
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
Who makest a show but darest not strike, conscience 
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from ward, 
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drop.


Beseech you, father.
 
PROSPERO:
Hence! hang on my garments. 

MIRANDA: 
Sir, have pity;
I'll be his surety. 

PROSPERO:
Silence! one word more
Shall make me chide if not hate thee. What! 
An for an imposter! hush! 
think'st there is no more such as he, 
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban
And they to are angels. 

MIRANDA: 
My affections
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man.

PROSPERO:
Come on; obey:
nerves are in their infancy again 
And have no vigour in them.


So they are;
My as in a dream, bound up. 
My father's loss, the weakness which 
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats, 
To whom I subdued, are light to me, 
Might but through my once day 
Behold all o' the earth 
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison. 

PROSPERO: 
 
MIRANDA:
Be of comfort;
My father's of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears speech: this is unwonted 
Which now came him. 
 
PROSPERO:
Thou shalt free 
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
All points of my 
 

To the syllable. 
 
PROSPERO: 
Come, follow. Speak not for him.
 
GONZALO: 
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much loss. Our hint of woe 
Is day some sailor's wife, 
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us: wisely, good sir, weigh 
Our sorrow with comfort. 
 
ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
He receives comfort like cold porridge.
 
ANTONIO: 
The visitor will not give him o'er so. 

SEBASTIAN:
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit; 
by and by it will strike. 
 
GONZALO:


SEBASTIAN: 
One: tell.
 
GONZALO:
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
Comes to the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN: 
A dollar.

GONZALO: 
Dolour comes to indeed: you 
have truer than you purposed. 

SEBASTIAN: 
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
 
GONZALO:
Therefore, my lord,-- 

ANTONIO: 
Fie, what a spendthrift is of his tongue! 

ALONSO: 
I spare. 
 
GONZALO:
Well, I have done: but yet,--

SEBASTIAN: 
He will talking. 
 
ANTONIO:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begins to crow?

SEBASTIAN: 
The old cock.
 
ANTONIO: 
The 
 
SEBASTIAN:
Done. The wager?

ANTONIO:
A laughter.

SEBASTIAN: 
A match!

ADRIAN: 
Though this island seem to be 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.

ADRIAN: 
Uninhabitable almost 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
Yet,--

ADRIAN: 
Yet,--

ANTONIO: 
He could not miss't. 

ADRIAN:
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate

 
ANTONIO: 
Temperance was a delicate wench.

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, a subtle; as he learnedly delivered. 
 
ADRIAN: 
The breathes upon here most 


As if it had lungs and rotten ones.

ANTONIO: 
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.

GONZALO: 
Here is everything advantageous to life.

ANTONIO: 
True; save means to 
 
SEBASTIAN:
Of that there's none, or little.


and lusty the looks! green! 

ANTONIO: 
The ground indeed is tawny.
 
SEBASTIAN:
With an eye of green in't.

ANTONIO: 
He misses not much. 

SEBASTIAN:
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
 
GONZALO:
But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
beyond credit,--

SEBASTIAN:
As many vouched rarities are.

GONZALO:
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses, being than stained 
salt 

ANTONIO: 
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
say he lies? 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
or very falsely pocket up his 

GONZALO: 
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
 

a sweet marriage, and we well in our return. 

ADRIAN:
was never with a paragon 
their 
 
GONZALO:
Not since widow Dido's time.

ANTONIO: 
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
widow 


What if he had said 'widower too? Lord, 
how you take it! 
 
ADRIAN:
Dido' said you? make me study of that: 
she was of of Tunis. 
 

This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

ADRIAN: 
Carthage?
 
GONZALO:
assure you, Carthage. 
 

His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
the and houses too. 
 
ANTONIO:
What impossible matter will he make easy next?

SEBASTIAN:
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
and give it his son for an apple.
 
ANTONIO:
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring 
forth islands. 
 
GONZALO: 
Ay. 

ANTONIO: 
Why, in good time.


Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh when we were at Tunis at the marriage 
of your daughter, who is queen. 
 
ANTONIO:
And the that e'er 
 
SEBASTIAN:
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.

ANTONIO: 
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.

GONZALO: 
Is not, my doublet as fresh as the first day I 
wore it? I mean, a sort. 

ANTONIO:
That sort was well fished 

GONZALO:
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
 
ALONSO: 
You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my there! for, coming thence, 
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee? 

FRANCISCO:
Sir, he may live:
I saw him beat the surges under him,
ride upon their backs; the 
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
He came alive to land. 

ALONSO: 
No, no, he's gone.
 
SEBASTIAN:
Sir, you may yourself for this great loss, 
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
lose her to an African; 
at least is from your eye, 
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

ALONSO: 
Prithee, 

SEBASTIAN:
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By all of us, and the fair soul herself 
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your

I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have 
widows in them of this business' making 
Than we bring to comfort them: 
The fault's your own.
 
ALONSO: 
So is the dear'st o' the loss.
 
GONZALO: 
My lord 
The truth you speak doth some gentleness 
And time speak it you rub sore, 
When you bring the plaster. 
 
SEBASTIAN: 
Very well. 
 
ANTONIO:
And most chirurgeonly.

GONZALO: 
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.
 
SEBASTIAN: 
Foul weather?

ANTONIO:
Very foul. 

GONZALO:
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--

ANTONIO:
sow't with nettle-seed. 

SEBASTIAN:
Or docks, or mallows.

GONZALO:
And king on't, would do? 

SEBASTIAN: 
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.

GONZALO:
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of 
Would I no name of 
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty, 
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use metal, corn, or wine, or oil; 
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and 
No sovereignty;-- 

SEBASTIAN:
Yet he would be king on't. 

ANTONIO:
The latter of his commonwealth forgets the 
beginning. 
 
GONZALO:
All things in common nature should produce 
Without sweat or treason, felony, 
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine, 
I not have; should bring forth, 
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
my people. 
 
SEBASTIAN:
No marrying 'mong his subjects?
 
ANTONIO: 
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves. 

GONZALO: 
I would with such perfection govern, sir,
To excel golden age. 

SEBASTIAN:
God save his majesty!

ANTONIO: 
Long live Gonzalo! 

GONZALO: 
And,--do you me, sir? 

ALONSO: 
no more: thou dost talk to 

GONZALO:
I do well believe your highness; and
did to minister to 
are of such sensible and nimble that 
they always use to laugh at nothing. 
 
ANTONIO:
'Twas you we at. 

GONZALO:
in this kind of merry fooling am nothing 
to may continue and laugh at 
nothing still.

ANTONIO:
a blow was there 
 
SEBASTIAN:
An it had not fallen flat-long.


You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
the moon out her she would continue 
in it five weeks without changing.

SEBASTIAN:
We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.

ANTONIO:
Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
 
GONZALO: 
No, I warrant you; I will not adventure 
discretion so weakly. Will you laugh 
me asleep, for I am very 


Go sleep, and hear us.
 

What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
They are inclined to do so.
 
SEBASTIAN:
sir, 
Do not omit the heavy offer of it: 
seldom visits sorrow; when it doth, 
It is a comforter. 

ANTONIO: 
We my lord, 
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.
 
ALONSO:
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

SEBASTIAN: 
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

ANTONIO: 
is the o' the climate. 
 
SEBASTIAN:
Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Myself disposed to 

ANTONIO: 
Nor I; my spirits are 
They fell together as consent; 
They as by a thunder-stroke. What might, 
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:-- 
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and 
My strong imagination a crown 
Dropping upon thy head.

SEBASTIAN: 
What, art thou waking?

ANTONIO: 
Do you not me 

SEBASTIAN:
I do; and surely
is a sleepy language and thou speak'st 
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
And yet so fast asleep. 
 
ANTONIO: 
Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking.
