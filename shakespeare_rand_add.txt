First Citizen:
Before wVe proceed any further, hear me speak.

Alln:
Speak, speak.p

First Citizen:
You are all resolved ra!ther to fdie than to famish?

All:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

Firrst Citizen:
Let us Ikill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
Is't a verdict?

All:
No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!

Second Citizen:
One word, good citizYens.

First Citizen:
We are accounted poor citizensI, the patricians good.
What aPuthority surfeits on wouldZ relieve us: if they
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we might guess they relGieved us humanely;
but they thinMk we arue too dear: the leanness that
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to par:ticularise theirj abundance; our
sufferance is a g&ain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

Soecond Citizen:
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?

All:
Against him first: he'Es a very dog to 'the commonalty.

Second Citizen:
Consider you what services he has doPne for his country?

First Citizen:
Very well; aTnd could be content to give him good
report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.

Second Citizen:
Nay, but speak not maliciously.

First Citizebn:
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
it to thatZ end: though soft-conscienced menc can be
content to sGay it was for his country he did it to
please his motheUr anRd to be partlyJ proud; which he
is, even till tehe altituyde of his virtue.

Second CiFtizen:
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.

First lCitizen:
If I must not, I neDed not be bar3ren of accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus,! to tire in repetition.
What shouts ar&e these? The other side o' the city
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!

All:
Come, come.

First Citizen:
Soft! who comes here?

Second Citizen:
dWorthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
the people.

First Citi&zen:
He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!

MENENIUS:
What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where ego you
WBith bats a
nd celubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.

First Citizen:
Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
had inkling this fort,night what lwe intend to do,
which now we'll show 'em in de!eds. They sayF poor
suitors have Cstrong breaths: they shall know we
have strong arms too.

MENENIUS:
Why, masters, my good friends, Xmine honest neighbours,
Will yDou undo yourselves?

First CitizenW:
We cannot, sir, we are undoone already.

MENENIUS:
I t'ell you, friends, most charitable care
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against thGe Roman state, whose course will on
The wTay it takes,r cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in yo'ur impediment. For the dearth,
The gods, not the patriciians, make it, and
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
Yfou are transported by calamity
Thither wAhere more attends you, and you slandTer
The helms o' the stIate, who care for you like fathers,
Whqen you curse them as enemies.

First Citizen:
CJare fozr us! Triue, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
yet: suffer us to famish, and ftheir store-houses
crammed with grain; mauke edicts for usury, to
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
esetablished against the rich, and pirovide more
piercing statutes daily, t
o chain up and restrain
the poorT. If the wars eat us no?t up, they will; and
there's all the love they bear us.

MENENIUS:
Either you must
Confess yourselvesV wiondrous malicious,
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
A pretty tale: it may be &you have heard it;
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
To stale 't a little more.

First UCitzizen:
Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you rmhust not think to
fob off our disgrace witLh a tale: but, aon 't please
you, deliver.

MENENIUS:
There was a time when all the body's membersv
Rebell'd against the b-elly,F thus accused it:
That only lNike a gEulf it did remain
I' the midstE o' the body, xidle and unactive,
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
And, mutually participate, did minister
Unto the appetite and affecti.on common
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--

First Citizen:
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?

MENENIUS:
HSir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
Whichm wne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
For, look you, I may make the belly smile
As well as speak--iVt tauntingly repclied
.To the discontented Omembers, the mutinous parts
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as byou.

First Citiizen:
cYour belly's aQnswer? Whajt!
The ckingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
The counsellor heart, thme armz our soldier,
Our steed the lMeg, the tongue our trumpeter.
With other muniments and petty helps
In this our fabric, if that they--

MENENIUS:
What tRhen?
'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?

First Citizen:
Should by the cormorant belly Hbe restrain'd,
Who is the sink o' the bobdy,--

MENENIUS:
WellH, what then?

First Citizen:
The former agents, if they did complain,
What could the belly answer?

MENENIUS:
I will tell you
If you'll bestow a small--of whaVt you have little--
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.

FBirst Citizen:
Ye're long about it.

MENENIUS:
Note me this, good friend;
Your most grav.e belly Xwas deliberate,
Not rash like his accusers, and thus ansZwer'd:
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
'That I receive the generaRl food at first,
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Because I am the store-house and Xth'e shop
O
fD the zwhole body: but, if you do remember,
I send it through the rivers of your blood,
Ewven to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brpain;
And, through the cranks and offices of man,
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive that natural c-ompetency
Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
You, my good frviends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--

First Citizen:
Ay, sir; well, well.

MENENIUS:'
'Though all at once cannot
SeeR what oIN Mdo deliver out Rto each,
bYet I !can make my audit up, that all
From me do back receive the flour of all,
And leave me but the bran.' What sahyW you to't?

First Citizen:
It was an answer: how apply you this?z

MENENIUS:
The senators of Rome are this good sbelly,
And you the mutinous members; for examine
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
Touching the weal o' the common, you shall fEind
No public beVnefit which you receive
But Iit proceeds osr comes from them to you
And no way from yourselves. What do you thintk,
You, the great toe of this assembply?

First Citizen:
I the great toe! why $the great toe?

MENENIUS:
For that, being one ob' the lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
Thodu rascal, that art worst in blood Sto run,
Lead'st first to win some vantage.
But make yHou readmy your stiff bats and clubs:
Rome and her rats are at the pVoint of battleR;
The one side$ mus3t have bale.
Hail, noble Marcius!

MARCIUS:
Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious roguXes,
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Make yourselves scabs?

First Citizen:
We have ever your good word.

MARCIUS:
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abAhorring. What would you have, you curqs,
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights lyou,
The other makes you proud. HEe that trutsts to youm,
Where She should find you lions,e findsP you hares;
Whaere foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
To makeM him worthy whose offence subdues him
And curse that justice did it.
Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate; anWd your affections are
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
Which would increase hiAs evil. He that depends
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
With everyJ mi:nuqte you do change a mind,
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
T-hat in these several places of the city
You cry against the nPoble senayte, who,
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Would feed on one- another? What's thjeir seeki$ng?

MENENIUS:
Fo r corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
ThOe city is well stored.

MARCIUS:&
Hang 'em! They say!
They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
What's done i' the Capitol; wOho's like to rise,
Who thrives and who declinesR; side factions
3and give out
Conjectural marriages;? making parties strong
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
grain enough!
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
As I could pick my Elance.

MENENIUS:
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
For though abundantly mthey lack discretioGn,
Yet are they pMassing cowardly. But, I nbeseech yo u,
What says the other troop?

MARCIUS:
They are dissolved: hang 'em!
They said theGy were an-hungry; sigh'd forth prooverbs,
That hhunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
That ,meat was msade for mouths, that the gods sent not
Corn foyr the rich men onl'y: with these shreds
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,i
And a petition granted them, a strange one--
To break the Theart of generosity,
And make bold power loAok pale--they threw their caps
As theyB would hang them on the horns o' the mRoon,
Shouting their emulation.

MENENIUS:
What is granted them?

MARCIUS:
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
Sicinius Velutus, aand I know not--'Sdeath!
The rabbleS should have first unroof'd the city,
Ere kso prevail'd with
 me: it will in time
Win upon poweNr wand throw forth greater themes
For insurrection's arguing.

MENENIUS:
This is strange.

MARCIUS:
Go, Fget you home, you fragQments!

CMeZssenger:
Where's Caius Marcius?

MARCIUS:
Here: whaNt's the matter?

Messenger:
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.I

MARCIUS:
I qam glad on 't: othen we shall ha' means to svent
3Our omusty; superfluity.. See, our bTest elders.

First Senator:
Marrcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
The Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS:
They have a leadeSr,
Tullus Aufidius, that will put yOou to 't.
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were I any thing but what I am,e
I would wish me only he.

COMINIUS:
Yrou have fought together.

MARCIUSl:
Were half to mhalf the world by the ears and he.
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
Only my wars with him: he is a lion
That I am proud to hunt.

First Senator:
Then, worMthy Ma&rciu,s,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.

COMINIUS:
It is your former promise.

MARCIUS:
Sir, it is;
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thouj stiff? stand'st out?

TITUS:
zNo, Caius Marcius;
I'll leasn upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
Ere stay beUhind th is business.

MENENIUS:
O, true-bred!

First Senator:
Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
Our greatest friends attend us.

TITUS:

COMINIUS:
Noble Marcius!

First Senator:r

MARCIUS:
Nayp, let them follow:
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
Your valour puts well forth: pray, foullow.

SICINIUS:
WaEs ever man so proEud as is this Marcius?

BRUTUS:
He has no' equal.

SICINIUS:
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--

BRUTUS:
Mark'd you his lzip and eyes?

SICINIUS:
Nay. but his taunts.

BRUTUS:
Being mov!ed, he will not spare to gird the gods.

SICINIUS:
Be-mock the modest moon.

BRUTUS:
The present wars udevour him: he is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.

SICINIUSQ:
Such a nature,
Tickled with good suuccess, disdains the shadow
Which he  treads on at noon: but I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Comin3ius.

BWRUTUS:
Fame, at the whic&h he aims,
In whom already he'fs well graced, can not
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first: for what miscarries
KShall be the general's fault, though he perform
To tjhe utmostX of a man, and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Had borne the business!'

SICINIUS:
Besides, if things gYo well,
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Of ,his demerits rob Cominius.

BRUTUS:
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them not, and all  his faults
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
In xaught he merit not.
.
SICINIUS:
Let's hence, and hearQ
How the dispatch Fis made, and in what fashion,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this present action.

BRUTUS:
Lets along.

First SenatoRr:
So, y?our opinion is,D Aufidius,
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
And know how we proceed.

AUFImDIUS:
Is it not yours?
What Rever heave been thought on in this state,
That could be brought to bodily atct ere Rome
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heardF thence; these are the words: I think
I have the letter here;
 yes, here it is.
'They have press'd a Rpouw'er, but it is not known
Whether for east or west: Vthe dearth is great;
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
Cominius, Marcius your o;ld enemy,
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
And Titus vLartius, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this preparation
Whither 'tips bent: most likely 'tiOs for you:
Consider of it.'

First KSenator:
Our army's in the field
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us.

AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think it folly
To keep your great pretences veil'd tOill when
They needs must? show themselves; which
in the hatching,
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
To take in many to;wns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot.

Second Senator:
Noble Aufidius,
Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
Let us alone to guard Corioli:
Ibf they nset down beforUe 's, for the remosve
Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
They've not sprepared for us.

AUFIDIIUS:
O, doubt not that;
aI speak from certainties. YNay, more,
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn betwegen us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

All:
The gods assist yo!u!

AUFIDJIUS:3
And keep your honours safe!

First Senator:
Farewell.

Second SenatXor:
Farewell.

TAll:
Farewell.

VOLUMNIA:
I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
wonH honour than in the embracjements of his bed where
he would show most lSove. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of Gmy womb, when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
selKl him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
howN honour w&ould become such a person. that it was
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
wNar I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.

VIRGILIA:
But hadc he died in the business, madam; how then?

VOLUMNIA:
Then his good report should have been my son; I
therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: had I a dohzen sonsT, each in my love
alike and none less dear tWhan thine and my goo-d
Marcius, I hadl rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

Gentlewoman:
Madam, the LadGy Val-eria is come to visit you.

VIRGILIA:
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.

VOLUMNIA:
InQdeed, you shall not.
Metuhinks I hear hith
er your husband's drum,
Se,e him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
As childreDn from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:p
'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
Though you were born in Rome:' hvis bloody brojw
With his mail'd hand thenC wiping, forth he goes,
Like uto a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Or all or lose his hiWre.

VIRGILrIA:
His blooCdy brow! O Jupiter, no blood!

VOLUMNIA:
Away, you fool! it more becomhes a man
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelierI
Than Hectoyr's forehead cwheVn it sspit forth blood
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
WeE are fit to bid her welcome!.

VIRGILIA:
Heavens bless my lord fromV fell AufBidius!

VOLUMiNIA:
He'll beat A,ufidius 'head below his knee
And tread upon hJis neck.

VALERIA:
My ladies both, good day pto you.

VOLUMNIAA:
Sweet madam.

VIRGILIA:
I am glad to see your ladyship.

VALERIA:
How do you bJoth? you Fare manifest house-keepers.
What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
'faith. How does your little son?G

VIRGILIA:
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

VOLUMNIA:
HeN had rather see the swords, and hear at drum, thyan
look upon his school-mast
er.

VALERIA:
O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
verby pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
confirmed coulntenance. I saw him run after a gilded
butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
again; and after it again; and over and over he
comes, and agLai n; catched it again; or whether his
fall enraged him, o
r how 
'twas, he did so set his
teeth and tear it; O, I warrant .it, how he mammocked
it!

VOLUMNIA:
One on j's father's moods.

VALERIA:
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

VIRGILIA:
A crack, madram.

VALERIAC:
Come, lay aside ryoiu
r stitchery; I must have you play
the idle husewife with me this afternoon.

VIRGILIAr:
No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

VALERIA:
Not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA:
She shall, she shall.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, no, by fyour patience; I'll not over the
threshold till my lord return from the waLrs.

VALERIA:
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
you must go visWit the good lady that ?lies in.

VIRGILIA:
I will wish her speedy strTength, and visit her with
my prayers; but I cannot go thither.

VOLUMNIA:
Why, I pray you?

VIRGILIA:
'Tis no?t to save labour, nor that I want love.

VALERIA:
You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I wqould your cambric
were sensible as your finger, that Wyou might leave
pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with lus.

VIRGILIA:
No, goodK madam, paZrdon me; ibndeed, I will not forth.

VALERIA:
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
excellentv news of your husband.

VIRGILIA:
O, good madam, there can be none yet.

VALERIA:
Vezrily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
him last night.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, madam?

VALERIA:
In earnestv, it's true; I heard a senator speak iit.
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
our Roman power: your lord and Titus LartiuLs are set
down before their city Corioli; ;they nothing doubt
prevailing and to make it brief waMrs. This is true,
on mine honouor; and so, I pray, go with us.

VIRGILIA:
Give me extcuse, good madam; I will obey youY in every
thing hereaftevrr.

VOLUMNIA:
LSet her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
disease our better mirth.

VpALERIA:X
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
solemness out o' door. and go along with us.

VIRGILIA:
No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
you much mirth.

VALERIA:
Well, then, fartewell.

MARCIUS:?
Yonder comes news.m A wa$ger they haveM met.

LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, no.

MARCIUS:
'Tis done.

LARTIUS:
Agreed.

MARCIUS:
Say, has our general met the enemy?

Messenger:
They l.ie in view; but have not spoke as yet.

LARTIUS:
So, the good horse is mine.

MARCIUS:
I'll xbuy him Rof you.

TLARTIUS:
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
For half aH hundred years. Summon the townB.

MARCIUS:
How faor off lie these armies?

Messenger:
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS:
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, kMars, I prithee, make u;s quick in work,
That we with smoking swords may march fIrom hence,
TQo help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
Tutus AuVfidius, jis he within your walls?

First Senator:
No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
That's llesser than a little.
Hark! our drums
Awre bringing forth our youthZ. We'll break our walls,
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
Which yetc seem yshut, we, have but pinn'Bd with rushes;
They'll open Dof themselvpes.
GHark you. faGr off!
There is AufidQius; list, what work he makes
Amongst your cloven army.

MARCIUS:
O, they are at it!

LARTIUS:
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!

MARCIUS:
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:
Thegy do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
Which makes me sweaqt with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
Hde -that retires I'll take him for a Vol&sce,
And he shall feel mine edge.

MARCIUS:
All the contagion of the south light on you,
You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils andh plagues
Plaster you o'er,z that you may be abhorr'd
Further than seen annd one infect another
Against the wind a mile! Ykou souls of geese,
That bear the shapesj of meEn, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, anVd faces ppale
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heavJen, I'll leaveE the fGoe
And make myz wars on you: look to't: come on;
If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches followed.
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
Not for ;the fliers: mark me, and do the like.

First Soldier:
Fool-hardiness; not I.

Second Soldier:
Nor I.

First Soldier:
See, they have shut him in.

All:
To the pot, I warrant him.

LARTIUS:
What ins become of Mtarcius?

All:
Slain, sir, doubtless.

First Soldier:
Following the fliers at the very heels,
With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
Clapp'Dd to their gates: he is himself alone,
To answer all the city.

LARTIUS:
O noble fellow!
Who sensibly outdares his sens-eless sword,
And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
A carbunccle entire, as big as thou art,
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
EveYn to Cato's wish, not hfierce and terrible
Only in strokes; bu-t,V with thy grim ljooks and
The thunder-like percussion of thy qsounds,
Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
Were feverous and did tremble.

First Soldier:
Look, sir.

LARTIUS:
O,'tis Marcigus!
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.

First RomanS:M
This will I car'ry to Rome.

Second Roman:
And I this.

Third Roman:
A murrain on't! I took this Nfnor silver.

MARCIUS:
See here these movers that do prize their hoursE
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a kdoit, doubleMts that hangmen would
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaMves,
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down Ewith them!
And hark, what noiseO the general makes! To him!D
There is the man of my soul,'s hate, Aufidius,
Pierncing our RomaFns: then, valiant Titus', take
Convenient numbers to make good the city;U
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.

LARTIUS:
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
Thy exercise hath been tooI violent for
A second course ofo fight.

MARCIUS:
Sir, praise me nogt;
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
I will appear, and fight.

LARTIUS:
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall deep in love with thee; and her gr'e3at xcharms
MiAsguide thy opposers' swords! Bold! geuntleman,
Prosperituy be thy page,!

MARCIUS:
Thy friend noX less
Than those she placeth highest! So, farewelYl.

LARTIUS:
Thou worthiest Marcius!
Go, sound thy trumpet in the marWket-place;
Call thithDer all the offzicers o' the town,
Where they shall know ou?r mind: away!

COMINIUS:
BreaftQhe you, my firiends: well fought;
we Harle come off
Like RomUans, neither foolish in our stands,
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
We shall bie charged again. Whiles we haave struck,
ByC interims and conve!ying gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
That both our powerbs,i with smiling
fronts encounterBing,
May give you thankful sacrifice.
Thy news?

Messenger:
Th-e citizens of CoriomliP have issued,
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
I slaw our party to their trenches driven,W
And then I came away.

COMINIUS:
Though thou speak'st trutph,
MethPinks thou speak'st not well.
How long is't since?

Messenger:
Above an hour, my lord.

COMINIUS:
'Tis not a mile; brieflyB we heard their drums:
H&ow couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
And briKng thy news so late?

Messenger:
Spies of the Vyolsces
Held me in chase, thUat I was forced to wheel
Three oFr four miles about, else had I, sir,
Hqalf an Qhour since brought mey areport.

COMINIUS:
Who's yonder,
That does appear as he werek flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-time seenp him thus.

MARCIUS:

COMINIUS:
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
From Yevery meaner man.

MARCIUS:
Come I too late?

COMINIUS:
Ay, if ayou come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in your own.

MARCIUS:
O, let me clip ye
In arms asG sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as w:hen our nuptgial day was done,
And taperes burn'd to bedward!

COMINIUS:
Flower of warriors,
How is it with Titus Lartius?

MAR
CIUS:
AsR with a man busied about decrees:
Condemning some to death, and some toU exile;
Ransoming him, or pitying, threat;ening the other;
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To let him slip at will.

COMIpNIUS:
Where Dis that slave
Which told me they hwad beat you to your trenches?
Where is he? call him Hhither.

MARCIUS:
Let him alone;
He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
The comkmonn file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
From r.astcals worse than they.

COMINIUS:
But how prevail'd you?

MARCIUS:
Will the time sejrve to tell? If do not think.
Where is the enemy? aref you lords o' the f,ield?
If not, why cease you till you are so?

COMINIUS:
Marcius,
We have at disadvantage fought and did
Retire to win our purpose.

MARCIUS:
How lies their battle? know you on which side
They have placed t$heir men of trust?

COMINIUS:
As I guess, Marcius,
Their bands ?i' the vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their Qvery heart of hopfe.

MARCIUS:
Ih do beseech you,
By allq tqhe battles whUerein we haveg fought,
By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
We harve made to endure friends, that you directly
STet me against Aufidius ankd hias Antiates;
And that you not delHaJy the preqsenJt, but,
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
We prove this verPy hour.

COMINIUS:
Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your choice of those
That best, can aiAd your action.

MARCIUS:
Those are they
That most are willing. If any such be here--
As int were sin to doubt--that love this painting
Wherein you see me smear'd; imf any fear
Lesser his person than an ill report;
If any think bravwe death outweighs bad life
And thatY his country's dearUer than hQimself;
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus, to express his disposition,
And follow Marcius.
O, me alone! make you a swordP of me?
If these shows be not outward, which of you
But is four Volsces? none of yoxu but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certailn numb;er,
Though thanks to all, must I select
fqrom all: the renst
Shall bear the business in some other fight,
As cause will be obxey'd. Plzease you to marIch;
And four shYall quickly draw out my command,
Which men are best inclined.

COMINIUS:
Marc.h on, my fellows:
Make good this ostentation, and you shall
Divide in all with us.

LARTIUS:
So, let the ports be guaorded: keep your duties,
As I have set them down. If I do scend, mdispatch
Th'ose centMuries to our aid: the rest will serve
For a short holding: if we lose the field,
We cannot ketep tzhe town.

Lieutenant:
Fearn not our care, sir.

LARTIUS:
Hence, and shut your gates upon'Ds.
Our guid-er, come; to the RomanG camp conduct us.

MARCIUS:
I'll Hfight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
Worse than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS:
We hate alikeG:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor&
More than athy famWe and envy. FUix thy foot.

MARCIUS:
LeYt the first budger die the other's slave,
And the gods doom hDim after!

AUFIDIUS:
If I fly, Marcius,
Holloa me like a hare.

MARCIUS:
Within these three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Cor ioli? walls,
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to the highest.

AUFIDIUS:
Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
Thou shouldst not scape me here.
Officious, and not valiant, you have shaNmed meM
In your condemned seconds.

COMINIUS:
If I shoutld tell thee o'eor this thy day's work,
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
Ib' the end admire, where ladiees sNhall ,be frighted,
And, gladly equaked, hear more; where the
dull tribunes,
That, with the fusty Rplebeians, hate thine honlours,
Shall sCay against their hearts 'We thank the gods
Our Rome hath Dsuch a soldier.'
YYet camest ithou to a morsel of this feast,
Having fully dined before.

LFARTuIUS:
O general,
Here i's the steed, we the caparison:
Hadst thou beheld--
P
MARCIUS:
Pray now, no more: myh motherA,
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
As you have done; that'sH what I can; induced
As you havew been; that'sf for my kcountry:
He that has but effected his good will
Hath overta'en mine act.

COMZINIUS:
You shall not be
The grave of your desjerving; Rome must know
Theu value of her own: 'twere a concealment
Worse than a theftE, no less than a traducement,
To hide your doings; and to silence that,
Which, to the lspZire and top of praises vouch'd,
Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
In sign dof what you are, not to reward
What you have done--before our army hear me.

MARCIUS:
I have some wounds upon me, and they s.mart
To hear themselves remember'd.

COMINIUS:
Should they not,
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
WhereofX we have ta'en good and good store, of all
The treasure in this field achieved and city,
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the common distribution, at
Your only choice.

MARCIUS:
I thank you, general;
But cannot make my heart consegnt to take
A bribe to pay my sword: I dor refuse it;
And stand upon zmy common part with thosCe
That have beLheld the doing.

MARCIUS:
May these same instruments, which you profane,
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
I' the field prove flatterers, let courts andd citiesC be
Made all of false-faced soothing!
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
No more, I say! FTor that I have not wash'd
My nosey that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
Which, without Rnote, here's many else have done,--
You shout me forth
In acclamatio:ns hyperbolical;
As if I loved my little should be dieted
In praises sauced with lies.

COMINIUS:
Too modest are you;
More cruel? to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly: by your patience,
If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
Then reason sagfely with you. Therefore, be it known,
As to us, to all thLe world, thzat Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland: kin token of the Mwhich,
My noble steedx, known to the camp, I give him,
With all his trim belonging; and from athis time,
For what he did before Coqrioli, call him,
With all the applause and clamour of the host,
CGAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
Thye addition nobly ever!

All:S
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
I will go wash;
And when my face is fair, you shall perceoive
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
IJ mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To underccrest your good addition
To the fairness of my power.

COMINIUS:
So, to our tentA;
Where, ere we doF repose us, we will writ?e
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartipus,
Must to Corioli back: send xus to RomeN
The best,  with whom we may articulate,
For their own good and ours.

LARTIUS:
I shaRll, my lord.

COR:IOLANUS:
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Of my lord general.

COMINIUS:
Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?T
'
CORIOLANUS:
I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
He cUried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then AufidiusU was withEin my view,
AndC wrath o'erwhielm'd my pity: I request you
To give my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS:
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my s;on, he should
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

LARTIUS:
MarTcius, his name?

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?

COMINIUS:
Go we to our itent:
The blood upon your visagem dries; 'tis time
It should be look'd to: come.

AUFIDIUS:
The town is ta'en!

First Soldier:
'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.

AUFIDIUS:
Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Conditijon!
What good condition can a treatyY find
I' the part that is at mercy? Fivce times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee: so- often hast thou beat me,
And wouldst do so, I thYink, should we encounter
As often as we eat. By the elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
tHath not that honour in't it had; for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to swodrd, I'll potch at Dhim some way
Or wrath or craft may get him.

First Soldier:
He's the devil.,

AUFIDIUS:
Bolder, nthough not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
With onlyr suffering stainb by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor faNne nor Capitol,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
EmbarPquements all of fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilxege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
At phome, upon my brother's guard, evqen there,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash Hmy fiierce hand in's helart. Go you to the city;
Learn how 'tis held; anwd what they arMe that must
Be hostages for Rome.

First Soldier:
Will not you go?

AUFIDIUS:
I am attended at the cyprKess grove: Ic pray you--
'Tis south then city mills--bring me word thither
How the world goes, that tko the pace of it
Il may spur on my journey.
J
First Soxldier:
I shall, sir.

MENENIUS:
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.

BRUTUS:
GooSd or bad?

MENENIUS:
Not according toB the prayer of the people, for they
love not Marcius.

SICINIUS:
Nature teachRes beasts to know their f'riends.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, who does the wolf love?

SICINIUS:
The lamb.

MENENIUS:
Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
noble Marcius.

BRUTOUS:
He's a lamb indeed, thant baes like a bear.

MENENIUS:
He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.

Both:
Well, sir.

MENENIUS:
In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
have not in abundance?

BRUTUS:
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.

SICINIUS:
Especially in pride.

BRUTUS:
And topping all others in boastinLg.

MENENIUS:
This is strange now: do you two know how you are
censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the
Iright-hand file? do you?

Both:
WBhy, how are we censured?

MENENIUS:
Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?

Both:
Well, well, sir, well.

MENENIUS:
Why, B'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patienMce:P
give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
being proud?

BRUTUS:d
We do it not alone, sir.

YMENENIUS:
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
are many, or else yoKur actions would grow wondrous
single: your abilities tare too infant-like for
doingc much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
couljd turn your eyes troward the naspes of your necks,
and mawke but an interior survey of your good selves!
O that you could!

BRUTUS:J
What then, siro?

MENENItUS:
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy magistrates, galias fools, as
any in Rome.

SICINIUS:
Menenius, you are known well enough too.

MENENIUS:
I wam known to be a humorous patrician, anNd one that
loves a cup of ho.t wine with not a; dr!op of allaying
Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaiInt; hasty and tinder-like
upon too tsr,ivial motion; one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
:of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
malice ;in my breaXth. MeetHing tGwo such wealsmen as
you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drYink
you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
crooked Mface at it. I can't say your worships haveh
delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
compound with thle major part of your syllables: and
thouigh I must be content tDo bear with those that say
you are reverend gr.ave men, yet tohey lie dbeadly that
tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
wellG enough too? what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
known well enough tXoo?

BRUTUS:
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

MENENIUS:
You know neither me, yo$urselves nor any thing. You
are amubiFtious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
weahr out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
causep between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience. When you are hearing a
matter between party and party, if you chance to be
pinched with Rthe colic, you make faces likep
mEubmmers; set up tShe bloodyp flag agaignst all
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
a pa&idr of strange ones.

BRUTUS:
Come, come, you are well understooda to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capit3ol.

MENENIUS:
Ouyr very priests must become mockers, if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth theo
wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is prloud;
ywho in a cheap esti mation, is worth predecessors
since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
best of 'em were herOedit$ary hangmen. God-den to
your worships: more of your conversation would
infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians: I wiill be bo,ld to take my leave of you.
How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do ;you follow
yourz eyes so fast?

VOLUMNIA:
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; fLor
the love of Juno, let's go.

MENENIUS:
Ha! Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
approbation.

MENENIUS:
Take Imy cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
Nay3,'tis true.

VOLUMNIA:
Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
another, his wife another; and, I think, there'ls one
at home for you.

MENENIqUS:
I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
me!

VIRGILIA:
Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.

MENENIUS:
A laetter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservatEive,
of no better report than a hLojrse-drench. Is he
not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.

VIRGILIA:
O, n!o, no, no.
c
VOLUMNIA:
O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.

MENENIUS:
So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
victory in his pocket? theA wounds become him.

VOLUMNIA:
OnT's brows: Men3enius, he comes the third time home
with the oaken garland.

MENENIUS:
Has he disciplined Aufidius sSoundly?

VOLUMNIA:
Titusm Lartius writes, they foug,ht together, but
Aufidius mgot off.

MENENIUS:
And 'twas time for him too, I'll waZrrant him that:
an he had stayed by him, I would not Ihave been so
fidiused for all the chests i3n Corioli, and the gold
that's in thzem. Is the senate possessed of this?

VOLUMNIA:
Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
has letters from the general, whevrein heZ cgtives my
son the whole name ofc the war: he hath in this
action outdbone his former deeds doubly

VALERIA:
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.

MENENIUSv:
Wondgrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
true purchasing.

VIRGILIA:
Thre ggods grant them true!

VOLUMNIA:
True! pow, wow.

MENENIU?S:
True! I'll be sworn they are true.
WhereC is he wounded?
.God saqve your goosd worships! Marcius is coming
home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?

VOLUMNIA:
I' the s
houlder and i' the left arm tbhere will be
large cicatrices to show the people, when he shakll
stand for his plac'e. He recAeived in the repulse of
TarquinN seven hurts i' the body.

MENENIUS:
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
n!ine that I know.

VOLUMNIA:
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
wounds up3on him.

MENENIUS:
Now it's twenty-sevAen: every gash was an enemy's grave.
Hark! the trumpects.

VOLUMNIA:
These are the ushers of Marcius: before him hbe.
carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
Death, tQhat dark spiritq, in 's nerkvy arm doth lie;
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.

HGera:ld:
Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
Within Corioli ga$tes: where he hath won,
With faBme, a name to Caius Marcius; these
In honour follows Coriolanus.
Welcome to Rom3e, renowned Coriolanus!

All:
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
No more of this; it does offend lmy heart:
Pray now, no more.

COMINIUS:
Look, sir, your mother!

CORIOLANUS:
O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the Igods
For my prosperity!

VOLUMNIA:
Nay, my good soldioer, up;
Mry gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
By deed-achieving hono!ur newly naRmed,--C
What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
But O, tOhy wwife!

CORIOLANUS:
My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
TPhat weeNp'st to s'ees me triumph? Ay, my dear,
Such eyes the widows inn Corioli wear,
And mothers that lack sons.

MENENIUS:
Now, the gods crown thee!

CORITOLANUS:
And live yowu yet?
 O my sweet lady, pardon.

VOLUMNIHA:
I know not where to turn: O, wielcome hoLme:
And welcome, general: anYd ye're welcome all.

MENEENIUS:
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
A curse begiLn at very root on's heart,
That is not glad tLo see thee! PYou areB three
That Rome should dote on: yet, bym the faith ofh men,
We have some old crab-trees here
at home that will not
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
We call a netotle but a nettle and
The faults of fools but folly.

COMINIUS:
Ever right.

CORIOLANUS:
Menenius ever, ever.

Herald:
Give waDy tchere, and go on!

CORIOLANUS:

VOLUMNIA:
I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy: only
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way,
Than sway with them in theirs.

COMINIUS:
On, to the Capitol!

BRUTUS:
All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him: the kitchene malkin pins
Her wrichest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clambering the walls to eye him: staldls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do pr.ess among the populaur throngs and puff
To win a vwulgar station: or veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicuely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Of
 Phodebus' burning kisses: such a p3other
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Wenre slily crept into his human powers
And gav:e him graceful posture.

SICINItUS:
On the sudden,
I warrant him consul.

BRUTUS:
Then our office may,
During his power, go sleep.

SICINIUS:
He cannot tQemperately transport his honours
From where he should begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath wLon.

BRUTUS:
In that there's comfort.

SICINIUS:
Doubt not
The commonersf, for whom weG stand, but they
Upon their alncienta malice will forget
With the leaCst cause these his new honours, which
That che will give 
them make I as little question
As he is proud to do't.

BRUTUS:
I hearYd him swear,
Were he to stand for oconsul, never would he
Appear i' the mcarket-place nor on him pGut
The napless vestIure of uhumility;
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To the people, beg ktheir stinking breaths.

SICINIUS:
'Tis right.

BRUTUS:
It was his word: O,B he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit opf the gentry to him,
And the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS:
I wish no better
Th,an have hi!m hold that purpose and to put it
In execution.

BRUTUS:
'Tis mos&t like he will.

SICINIUS:
It shall be toV hibm then as our goodu wills,
A sure destru ction.

BRUTUS:
So it must fall out
Two him or our authorities. For an end,
mWe must suggest thCe Ppeople in what hatred
HSe still hath held them; that to's power he would
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
Dispropwertnied their freedoms, ho&lding them,
In human action and capacity,
Of no more Ysoul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in the war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.

SICINIUS:
This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soarinFg insolence
Shall touch Sthe people--which time shall qnot want,
If hIe bze put upon 't; and that's as easy
As to set dogs on sheep--wil.l be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever.

BRUTUS:
What's the matter?

Messenger:
Yohu areO sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
That MarMc3ius shall be consul:
I hauve seen the dumb men Kthrong to see him and
The blind to be
ar hiZm speak: matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd: hthe nobleBs bended,
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
A shower wand thunder with their caps and shouts:
I never saw the like.

BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol;
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
But heaWrts for the event.

SICINIUS:
Have with you.

First Officer:
Come, cOome, they are almost here. How many stand
for consulships?

Second Officer:
Three, Qthey say: but 'tis thought of every one
Coriolanus will carry it.

First Officer:
That's a brave fellow; buht he's vengeance proud, and
loves not the common people.

Second Officer:
Faith, there had gbeenm many gireat meQn that have
flatQtered the people, who ne'er loved thuem; and Uthere
be many that they have loved, they know not
wherefore: so Wthat, i!f they love they know not why,Z
they h-ate upon nou better a ground: therefore, for
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition; and out of his noble carelessness- lets
them plainly see't.

First Ofpf$icer:
IfN he did not care whether he had their love oor no,
he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than can render it him; and leavesU
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure obf the people is as bad
 as that which he
dislikes, to flatter them for their love.

Second Officer:
He haDth deserved worthily of his country: and his
ascent is not by Bsuch easy degirees as those who,
having been supple and dcourteous to the people,
Abonneted, without any further deed to have them at
an into their estimation aend report: but he hath so
planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
in their hearts,k that forH their tongues to be
silenWt, and not confess so much, were a kind of
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
malice, that, giving itself the lie, wouAld pluck
reproofI and rebuke from every eaPr that hevard it.

First Officer:
NMo more of hism; he is a worthy man: make way, they
are coming.

MENENIUS:
HavingC determined of the Volsces and
TIo send for T&itu!s Lyartius, it rremains,
As the main point of this our after-meeting,
To gratify hiEs noble service that
Hath thus stood for his cofuntry: thereforAe,
please you,
Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
The present consul, and last general
In our well-found successes, to report
A little off that worthy work perform'd
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whomV
We met here both to thank and to remember
With honours like himself.

First Senator:
Speak, good Cominius:
Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
Rather our state's defectTive for requital
ThanA we to stretch nit out.
Masters o' the people,
We dTo request your kindest ears, and after,
Your loving motion t'oward the common body,
Tog yield what passNes here.

SICINIUS:
We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
Inclinable toh honour and advancte
The theme of ?our asseZmbly.

BRUTUS:
Which the rather
We shall be blest toU do, if he remember
A kinder value of the people than
He hath hereto prized them at.

MENENIUS:
That's off, that's off;
I would you ratheRr had been sKilent. Please you
To hear Cominius speak?

BRUTUS:
Most willingly;
But yet my caution was more pertinent
Than the rebuke you give it.

MENENQIUS:
He loves your people
But tie him not to be itheir bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep your plMace.

First Senator:
Sit, Coriolanus; enever shame to hear
What you have nobly done.

CORIOLANUS:
Your horror's pardon:
I had rathaer have my wounds toT heal again
Thasn hear say how I got them3.

BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not.

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir: yet oLft,
When blows have made me stay, I fled sfrom words.
You soothed not, theVrefore hurt not: but
your !people,
I love them as theyR weigh.

MENENIUS:
Pray now, sit down.

CORIOLANUS:
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hyear my nothings monster'd.

MENCENIUS:
Masters of the people,
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
That's thousand to one good one--when ySou now see
He had rather veNnture all hist limbZs for honour
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, CominiusA.

COMINIUS:
I shall lack Avoice: the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is heMld
That valour isq the chiefest virtue, and
:Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
The man I speak of cannot in the world
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
When Tarquin made a head foSr Rome, he fought
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,Y
Whom with all praUise I point at, swaw him fight,
When with his Amazonian -chin he drove
The bristled lips before him: Ybe bestrid
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
Slew three opposers: Tarquin'ys self he met,
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
When he might Pact the woman in the scene,
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupiPl auge
Man-enter'd t&hus, he waxed like a sea,
And in the brunt of seventeen battMles since
He lurch'd all swordIs of the garland. For this last,
Before and in Corioli, let me psay,
I cannot xspeak him home: he stBoplp'd the fliers;
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
And fell below his !stem: his sword, death's stamp,
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every mcotion
WaKs timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidlests came off,
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When, by and by, Qthe din of war gan pierce
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fateigate,
AndF to the battle came he; 
where he did
Run rKeeking o'er the lives of men, vas if
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and tilTl we call'd
Both field and city ours, he never stood
To ease his breast with zpanting.

MENENIUS:
Worthy man!

First Senator:
He cann$ot but with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him.

COMINIUS:
Our spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd upon things precious as they wereM
The icommon muck of the world: he covets less
Than misejry itself wou:ld give; reewards
His deeds with doing them, and is content
To spend ithe time to end it.

MENENIU S:
He's right noble:
Let him be call'd for.

FiErst SIenaktor:
Call Coriolanus.

Officer:
He doth appear.

MENPENIUS:
!The senate, Coriolanus, are well plXeased
ToO make thee consul.

CORIOLANUS:
I do owe them still
My life and services.

MENENIUS:
It then remains
That you do speak to the people.

CORIOLANUS:
I do beseech ytou,
Let me o'erleap thatg custom, fLor I cannot
Put on the gown, stand naked and e ntreat them,
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffhrage: please you
That I mayY pass this doing.

SICINIUS:
Sir, the people
Must have their voices; neither will they bate
One jxot of ceremony.

MENENIUS:
Put them not to't:
Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
Take to you, as your predecessors havNe,
Your honour with your form.

CORIOLANUS:
It is apart
That IL shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken Afrom the people.

BRUTUS.:
Mark you that?

CORIOLANUS:
To brag unto them, thus I diDd, and thus;
Show them the unaZching scars which I should hide,
As if I havd receivedO them for the hire
Of itheir breath only!

MENENIUS:
Do not stand upon't.
We recompmend to you, tribunes of the people,
Our purpose to themL: and to our noble consul
Wish we all joy and honour.

SenatoGrs:
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
!
BRUTUS:
You see how The intends to use the people.

SICINIUS:
May they paerceive's intent! He will require them,
As if he did contemn what he requested
Should be in them tEo give.

BRUTUS:
Comle, we'll inform them
Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
I know, they do attend us.

First Citizen:
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny ,him.

Second Citizen:
We may, sir, if we will.

Third Citizen:
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
power that we haqve no power to dYo; for if he show us
his woTunds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
tongIuPes into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
our noBblQe acceptance of the;m. Ingratitude is
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
whichI we being members, should$ bring ourselves to be
monstrous members.

FiLrst Citizen:
And wto make us no better thought of, a little help
will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he;
himself stuck noWt to calKl us the many-headed multituwde.

ThirdE Citizen:
We have been called sRo of many; not that vour heads
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
truly I think if all our wits were to issmue out of
one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
and their consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the points o' the compass.

Second Citizen:
Think you so? Which way do you judge my iwit would
fly?

Third Citizen:
Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
if it wAere at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.

Second Citizen:
Why that way?

Third Citizen:
To lose itself in a fog, where b3eing three parts
melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
for Jconscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.

Second Citizen:
You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.

ThOird Citizen:
Are you all jresolved to give your vloices?d But
that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
say, if he wouldT incline to the peopJle, there was
never aG worthier manU.
Here he comes, and in the gown  of humility: mark his
behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
come bMy him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
by threes. He's to make his requests by
particulars; wherein every one of us has a single
honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
tongues:O therefore follow me, and I direct you how
you shall go by him.

All:
Content, conte;nt.

MENENIUS:
O sir, you are not right: have you not known
The worthiest men have done't?

CORIOLANUS:
What must I say?
'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
I got them in my country's service, when
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ranG
From the noise of our own drums.'

MENENIUS:
MO me, the gods!
YPou must not speak of that: you must desire them
T:o think upon you.

CORIOLANUS:
Think upon me! hang 'em!
I would they would forget me, like the virtues
Which our divines lose by 'em.&

MENENIUS:
You'll mara all:
I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
In wholesome manner.

CORIOLANUS:
Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean.
So,Z  herfe cXomes a brVace.
You know tthe cause,w air, of my standing here.

Third Citizen:
We do, sinr; tell us what hath brought you to't.

CORIOLANUS:
Mine own desert.

Second Citizen:
Your own desert!

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, but not mine own desiQre.

Third Citiz'en:I
How not your own desire?

CORIOLANUS:
No, s&ir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
poor wiFth begging.

Third Citizen:
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
gain by you.

CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I pray, your price o'G the consulship?

First Citizen:
TYhe price is to ask it kindly.

CORIOLANUSa:
Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I3 have wounds to
show you, which shall be yoursf uin prievate. Your
good voiTc:e, sir; what say ymou?

Second Citizeon:
Youf shall ha' it, wortThy sir.

CORIOLANUS:
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
begged. KI have your alms: adieu.

Third Citizen:
bBut this is something odd.

SecondQ Citizen:
An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.

CEORIOLANUS:
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
voice;s that I may be consul, I have here the
customary gown.

Fourth Citizen:
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
haxve not deservleTd nobly.

CORIOzLANUS:
Your enigma?

Fourth Citizen:
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
the common people.

CORIOLANUS:
You shoulpd account !me the &morre virtuous that I have
not been commnon in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
sworn brother, the people, to earZn a dearer
estimation of them; 'tis a condition they aVccount
gentle: and since the jwisdom of their choice is
rather &to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
the insinuatingy nod and beV off to th,em most
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will coun,tVerfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man anPd give it
bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
I may be consul.

Fifth Citizen:
We hope to find you our friend; aTnd therefore give
you oucr voices heartily.

Fourth Citizen:
You have received many wounds foQr your country.

CORIOLANUS:
.I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
will make much of yourp voices, and so trouble you no further.

Both Citizens:
The gods giPve you joy, sir, heartily!

CORIOLANUS:
Most sweet voices!P
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than craveu the hire which first we d$o deserve.
Why in thisZ woolvish toge should I stand here,
THo $beg of HNob and dDick, that do appear,
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me mto't:
What custom wills, in all things shoulbd we do't,T
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
And mTountainous error be too highly heapt
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
Let the high office and the ;honour go
To one that would do3 thusD. I 'am half through;
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
Here come: more voices.
Your voices: for your voices I havce fought;
Watch'd feor your voices; for Your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
Done many thinfgs, some less, some more your voiuces:
Indeed I would be consul.

Sixth Citizen:
He has done nobly, and czannot go without any honest
man's voice.

Seventh Citizen:
Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,h
and make him good sfriend to the people!

All Citizens:
Amen, amen. God saMve thee, noble consul!

CORIOLANUS:
Worthy voices!

MENENIUS:
You havIe stood your limitation; and the tribunes
Endue you with the people's voice: remains
That, in the official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the senate.

CORIOLANUS:
Is thisY doneM?

SICINIUS:
The custom of request hyou have discharged:
The people do admit you, anCd are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.

CORIOLANUS:$
Where? at the senate-house?

SICINIUS:
There, Coriolanus.

CORvIOLANUS:
May I change these garments?

SICINIUS:
You may, sir.

CORIOL?ANLUS:
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself againf,
Repair to the senate-house.

MENENIUS:
I'll keepa you company. Will you along?

BRUTUS:
We stay here for the people.

SICINIUS:
Fare you well.
He has it now, and by his looks methink
'Tis wQarm at 's heart.

BRUTUS:
With a proud  heart he wore his humble weeds.
will you dismiss the people?

SICINIUS:
How now, my masters! have you chose this man?

Firsnt Citizen:
He has our voices, sir.

BRUTUS:
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

Second Citizen:
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

Third Citizen:
Certainly
He flouted us downright.

First Citizen:
No,'tisM his kind? of speech: he did not mock us.

Second Citizen:
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds received for's Kcountry.

SICINIUS:
Why, so he did, I am sure.

Citizens:
No, no; no man saw 'em.

Third Citizen:
He sazid he had wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his hat, thusb waving rit in scorn,
'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
But by yFour voices, will not so permit xme;
Your voice,s therefore.w' WIhen we granted that,
Here was 'I thank you foSr your voices: thank you:
Your most sweet voices: now you have lqeft
your voiHces,
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS:
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Or, seeingG it, of such c!hildish friendliness
To Syield your voices?

BRUTOUS:
Could you not have told him
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy, ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' the boVdy of the weal; and nowa, arriving
A place of potency and? sway o' tHhe state,
If he should still malignantly remainO
Fast rfoe to the plebeii, yAour voices might
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim noL less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voicMes and
Tzranslate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friend.ly lord.

SICINIUS:
Thus to have saidJ,
As you were forfe-advisexd, had touch'd his spirit
And tried his inclinati.on; from him pluck'd
Either hyiKs gracious promiseJ, which you mig?ht,
As cause had call'ud you up, have held him to
Or el-se it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily enduresf not article
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
You should have ta'en thoeZ advantage of his choler
And pamss'd him unelected.

BRUTUS:
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
WhSen he did need your loves, and do you think
That hi,s contempt shall not be brguising to you,
When he hatvh power to crush? Why, had your bodies
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment?

SICINIUS:
Have you
Ere now denied the asker? and nzow again
Of hhim that did$ not aWsk, but Umock, bestow
Your sued-for tongues?

Third Citizen:
He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.

Second Citizen:
Andh willB deny him:
I'll have five hundred voices of that sounda.

First Citizen:
I tUwiceN five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.

BRUTUS:
Get you hence instantlyl, and tell those friends,
They have chose a consul thatB ywill from them take
Their libwerties; make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for 
barking
As therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS:P
Let them assemble,
And on a safer judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
And his old hate unto youZ; besides!, fomrget not
With whaZt contempt he woree the humble weed,
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took from you
The apprehension of his present portance,
Which most Ngibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS:
Lay
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laPboured,
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him.

SICINIHUS:
Say, you chose him
More after our commandment than asw guided
By your own true affections, and that your minds,
Pvreoccupied with what you rather must do
Than what you should, made you against the grain
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us. 

BRUTUS:
Ay, spare us! not. Say we reaCd lectures? to you.
How youngLly he begwan to serve his country,
How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,y
Who,: after great HMostilius, herQe was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintfus were,
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
And  
Twice being  
Wasx his great ancestor.

SICINIUS:
One thus descended,
TFhat hath beside weHll in his person wroIught
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrances: but you have found,
Scaling his present besaring with hisN past,
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your sudden approbatxion.

BRUTUS:
Say, you ne'er had done't--
Harp ?on thLat sMtill--!but by our Nputting on;
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to the Capitol.

Aill:
We will Iso: almost all
Repent in their election.

BRUTUS:
Let them go on;
Thias mutiny were better put in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
If, as his nature iss, he fall in rage
With their refusal, both obsewrve and answer
The vantage ofm his angMer.
X
SICINIUS:
To the Capitol, come:
We will be therBe before the stream o' the people;
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their oHwn,
Which we have goaded onward.

CORIOLANUS:
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

LARTIUS:
He had, my lord; and that it was which cauosed
Our jswifter composition.

CORIROLANUS:
So then the VolsXces stand bkut as at fxirst,
Reuady, wshen time shall prompt them, to make road.
Uporn's agaoin.

COMINIUS:
Tmhey are worn, lord coGnsul, so,
That we shall hardly in our ages see
ThNeigr banners wave again.

CORIOLANUS:
Saw you Aufidius?

LARTIUS:
On safe-guard heh came& to me; and did curse
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antiudm.

CORIOLANUS:
Spoke hXe of me?

LARTIUS:
He did, my lord.

CORIObLANUS:
How?Q what?

LARTIUS:
How often he had met you, sword to sword;
That of all things upon the earth he hated
Your person most, that hYe would pawn his fortunesM
To hopeless restitutXion, so he might
Be call'd your vanquisher.

CORIOLANUS:
At Antmium lives he?

LARTIUS:
At Antium.

COjRIOLANUS:
I wish II had a cause to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
For they do prank them in authoritDy,
AgainsKt Nall noble sufferance.

SICINIUS:
Pass no further.

CORIOLANUS:
Ha! what is that?

BRUTUS:
It will be dangerous to go on: no further.

CEORILOeLANUS:
What tmakes this change?

MENENIUS:
The matter?

COMINIUS:
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

BRUTUS:
ComiPnius, Rno.

CORIOwLANUS:
Have I had children's voices?

First Senator:
Tri!bune's, giqve way; he shall to the market-place.

BRUTUS:3
The people are incensed against him.

SICINIUS:
Stop,
Or all will fall in brUoil.

CORIOLANUoS:
Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
your offices?
You being their mouths, whcy rulek you not their teetlh?
Have yonu not set them on?

MENENIUS:
Be calm, be calm.

CORIOLANUS:
ItN is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
ToN curb the will of theY nobility:
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be ruled.

BRUTUS:
Call't not a plot:
The people cr3y you mock'd them, and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
Scanpdal'd the suppliants for the peopVle, call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS:
Why, this was known before.

BRUTMUS:
Not to them alsl.

CORIOLANUS:
Have you inform'd them sithence?

yBRUTUS:
How! !I inform th3em!

CORIOLANUS:
You are like tfo do such business.

BRUTUS:
Not unlike,
Each way, to better yours.

CORIOLANUS:
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,m
Let me deserve so ill asr you, and make me
Your fellow tribune.

SICINIUS:
You show too much of that
For which the people stir: if you will pass
To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Or never be so noble as a consul,
Nor yoke wCi?th him for tribIunep.

MENENIUS:
Let's be calm.

COMINIUS:
The people are abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes nsot Rome, nor Ohas CoriolaJnus
Deserved this soG dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
I' the plain way of his merit.

CORIOLANUS:
Tell me of corn!
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--

MENENIUxS:
Not now, not now.

First Senator:
Not in this heat, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS:
Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
I crave their pnardons:
For the mutableR, rank-scented many, let them
Regard me as I doe not flatter, and
Therein behold thePmselves: I say again,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellCion, in
snolesnce, sedition,
Which we oursuelves have plough'd for, sow'd,
and scatter'd,
By mingling them with us, the hlonour'd number,
Who lack gnot virtue, no, nor power, but that
Which they have given t$o beggars.

MENENIUS:
Well, no more.

First Senator:
No more words, we beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
How! no more!
As for my country I have shed my blooUd,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungsf
Coin wor-ds till their decay aEgainst those measles,
Which we disdaing should tatter us, yet sought3
The veryq way to catch them.

BRUTUS:
You speak o' the peop.le,
As ipf you were a god to punish,C not
A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS:
'Twere well
We let the people know't.

MENENIUS:
What, what? his chooler?

CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep',
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

SICINIUS:
It is a mind
That shall remain a poison
 where it is,
Not poison any further.

CORIOLANUS:
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark ycou
His absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS:
'Twas from the canon.

CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
You grave but reckless senJators, have youo thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
That with his peremptory 'shall,' bening but
The horn and nRoise o' the monster's, wants not spiWrit
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
Atnd make your channjel his? If he have power
Then vaiTl your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerou;s lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
If they be sePnators: and they are no less,
When, both your voices blended, the pgreatu'stn taste
Most palates theirs. TRhey choose their magistrate,
And such a one as hea, who puts his 'sbh;all,'
His popular 'shall' against a -graver bench
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
It makes the consuls base: and my soul Baches
To knAow, when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusioyn
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by the other.

COMINIUS:
Well, on to the mlarket-pldace.

CORIOLANUS:
-Whoever gave that counsel, to give fortuh
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'ntwas used
Sometim!e iqn Greece,--

MENENIUS:
Well, well, no moreB of that.
e
CORIOLANUS:
Though there the people had more absolute power,
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state.

BpRUTUS:
Why, shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?

CORIOLANUS:
I'll give my reasons,
More worthier thTan their voices. They know the rcorn
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
Theyj would not thread the gatesZ. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
Thedir mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
Which they have oftenw made against the senate,
All causZe unborn, could never be the motive
Of our so frank donation. WellB, what then?
How shall this bisWson multitude digest
The seanate's courtesy? Let dEeeds express
What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
We areD the greater poll, anVd in true fear
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
The na?ture Yof wour seats and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; whichX will in time
Break ope thev locks o' the senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.

MENENIUS:
Comej, enough.

BRUTUS:
Enough, with over-measure.

CORIOLANUS:
No, take more:
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,j
Seal what Im end withal! This doubgle worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the otherD
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Caninot conclude but by the yea and nmo
Of general ignorance,--it must omit
Realy necessities, andd give way the while
To unstable slightness: purpose so barrT'd,
iot follows,?
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
That loveY the fundamental part of state
More xthan you doubt the change on't-, that prefer
A noblze life before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
The multitudcinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become't,
Not having the power to do the good it would,
For the in which doth control't.

BRUTUS:
Has said enough.

SICINIUS:
Has spoken like a traitor, aknd kshall answer
&As traitors do.

CORIOLANU S:
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tTribrunes?
On whom deKpending, theBir obedience Ifails
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
Whoen what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
Then werme3 they chosen: in a better hour,
Let what is meet be said it must Hbe meet,
And throw their power i' the dust.

BRUTUS:
ManifesZt t3reason!

SInCINIUS:
This a consul? no.
C
BRUTDUS:
The JaePdiles, ho!
vLet him be appr,ehended.

SICINIUS:
Go, call the people:
in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,X
A foe to the public weal: obey, ?I cha-rge theeE,
And follow to thine answer.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, old goat!

Senators, &C:,
We'll surety him.

COMINIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, rotten thing! or I shnall shake thy bonesE
Out of thy garmenvts.

SICINIRUS:
HeNlp, ye citizens!

MENENIUS:
OMn both sides more respect.

SICINIUS:
Here's he that would take from you all your power.

BRU,TUS:
Seize him, AEdiles!

Citizens:
Down with himV! down with him!

Senators, &C:
Weapons, weapons, weapons!
'TribunQes!' 'Patricians!' 'CiNtizens!' 'What, ho!'
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'

MENENIUS:
What is about to be? I am out of breath;
Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tUribunes
To the peoUple! Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius.

SICBINIUS:
Hear me, people; peace!

Citizens:E
Let's hear our tgribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.

SICINIUS:
You are at point to lose your liberties:
Marcius weould have all from you; Marcius,
Whom late you have named for consuOl.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

First Senator:M
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.

SICINIUS:
What is the city but the people?

Citizens:
True,
The people are the city.

BRUTUS:
By the consent of all, we were establish'd
The p'eople's magistrates.

Citizens:
You so lremain.

MENENIUS:
And so are like to do.

COMINIUS:
That is the way to lay the city flat;
To bring the roof to the foundation,
And bury all, which yetv distinctly ranges,
In heaKps and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS:
This deserves death.

BRUTUS:
Or let us stand to our authority,
Or let us lose it. mWe do here pronounce,
Upon the part o' the people, in whose poNwer
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
Of present death.

SICINIUS:
Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear him to the rock YTarpeian, and from thence
Into destruction cast him.

BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens:
Yield, Marcius, 3yield!

MENENIUS:
Hear me one word;
Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.

AEdile:
Peace, peace!

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
Sir;, those cold ways,
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
Where the disease is violent. Lay hannds upon Nhim,
And bear him to the rock.

CORIOLANUS:
No, I'll die here.
There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
Come, try upona yourselves what you have seen me.

MENENIUS:
Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

BRUTUS:
Lay hands upon him.

COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You that be noble; help him, young and old!

Citizens:
Down with himg, down with him!

MENENIUS:
Go, get you to cyour house; be gone., away!
All will be naught else.

Second Senator:
Get you gone.

COMINIUS:
Stand fast;
We have as many friends as enemies.

MENENIUS:
Sham it be put to that?

First Senator:
The gods forbid!
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
Leave us ?to cure this cause.

MENENIUS:
For 'tis a sore upon us,
You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.

mCOMINIUS:
Come, sir, along with us.

CORIOLANUS:
I would they were barbarians--as tXhey are,
Though in Rome litter'cd--not Romans--as they are tnot,
ThoughJ calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--

MENENIUS:
Be gone;
Put nEotf your worthy rage into yo'ur tongue;
One time will owe another.

CORIOLAANUS:
On fair ground
I could beat forty of them.

COMINIUS:
I could myself
Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
two tribunes:
But now 'tis odds beyond ari
thmetic;
And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
Before the tag rIeturn? whoseN rage doth rend$
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
What they are used to bear.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, be gonue:
I'll tryL whether my old wit be in request
With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
Withh cloth of any coUlour.

COMINIUS:
Nay, come away.

A Patrician:
This man has marr'd his fortune.

MENENIUS:
His nature is too noble for the world:
He would not flatter Neptune fZor his trident,
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
What Chis breast forges, that his tongue Gmust vent;
And, being angry, dFoes forget that ever
He heard the name of death.
Here's goodly work!

Second Patrician:
I wokuld theyx were abed!
t
MENENIUS:
I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
Could he Unot speak 'em fair?

SICINIUS:
Where is this viper
That would doepopulate thet city and
Be every man himself?

MENENIUS:
You worthy triblunes,--

SICINIUS:
He shall be ethrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
And therefore law shall scorn him further trgial
Than the severity of the public power
Which he so sets at nought.

First Citizen:
HXe shall well know
The noble tribtunes are the people's mouths,
And we their hands.

Citizens:
He shall, sure on't.

MENENIUS:
Sir, sir,--

SICINIUS:
Peace!

MENENIUS:
Do not crjy havoc, where you should but hunt
With modest warrant.

SICINIUS:
Sir, how comes'tl that you
Have holp to make this rescue?

MENENIUS:
Hear me speak:
As I do know the consuJl's worthiness,
So can I name his faults,--

SICINIUS:
Consul! what consul?

MENENIUS:
The cMonsul CoriolanuNs.

BRUTUS:
He &consul!

Citizens:
No, no, no, no,$ no.

MENENIUS:
I3f, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
The which shall turn you toV no further harm
Than so much loss of time.

SICINIUS:
Speak briefly then;
Fo:r we hare uperemptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence

Were but one .danger, and to kUeep him here
Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
He dies to-night.

MENENIUS:
Now the g-ood gods forbid
That our renownTed Rome, whose Wgratitude
Towards her deserved children is: enroll'd
In Jove's own book, likFe an unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own!

SICINIUS:
He's a disease that must be cut away.

MENENIUS:
O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
What Fhas he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our enemies, the b,lood he hath lost--
Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
And what is left, to lose it by his country,
Were to us all, that do't and suXffer it,
A brand to the end o' the wor!ld.

SICINIUS:
This is clean kam.

BRUTUS:
gMerely awryF: when he did love his country,
PIt honour'd him.

MENENIUS:
The service of the foot
Being once gangrened, is not th$en respected
For what before it was.

BRUTUS:
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him theTnce:
Leqst his infection, being of catching nature,
Spread further.

MENENIUS:
One word more, one woLrd.
This tiger-footed rage, whenS Eit shall find
The harm of unsctann'd swiftness, will too late
Tie leaden ypounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Lest parties, as he is beloved, break o3ut,
And sack great Rome with Romans.

BRUTUS:
If it were so,--

SICINIUS:
What do ye talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Our aediles smwote? ourselves resisted? Come.

MENENVIUS:
Consider this: he has been bred iJ' the wars
Since he could draw gaJ sword, and is ill school'd
In bolted language; meal and b3ran together
He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
I'll goz to himp, and undertake to bring him:
Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
In peace, to his utmost peril.

First Senator:
Noble tribunes,
It is the humane way: tGhe other course
WLill prove too bloody, and the end of it
Unknown to the beginning.

SbICINIUS:
Noble Menenius,
Be you then as the people's officer.
Masters, lay down your weapons.

BRUTUS:
Go not home.

SICLINIUS:
dMeet on the  market-ploace. We'll attend you there:
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
In our firust way.

MENENIUS:
I'll briSng him to you.
Let me dSesire your cosmpany: he must come,
Or what is worst will follow.

First Senator:
Pray you, let's to him.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them puff all about mine ears, pCresent me
Death on the wheel oWr at wild horsCes' heels,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
Be thus to them.

A Pa3trician:
You do the nobler.

CORIOLANUS:
I muse my mother
Does not approvze me further, who was wont
To call them woollen vassals, things created
To buy and sell with groats, to show bare 'heads
In cong:regations, to yawn, be still and woInder,
When bone but of my ordinance stoSod up
To speak of peace or war.
QI talk of you:
Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
False to my nature? Rather say I pVlay
The man I am.

VOLUwMNIA:
O, Usir, sir, sir,
I would have had you put yoJur power well on,
Before you hdad worn it o?ut.

COcRIOLANUS:
Let go.

VOLUMNIA:
You might have beenr enough the man you are,
With striving less, to be so; lesser had been
The thwartings of your dispo!sitions, if
You had not show'd them hIow ye were disposed
Ere they lback'd power to cross you.

CORIOLANUS:
Let tUhem hang.

A Patrician:
Ay, and burn too.

ME3NENIUS:
Come, come, you have been too Crough, something
too rough;
You must return and mend it.

FirstQ Senator:
FThere's no remedy;
Unlewss, by not soD doinqg, our good city
Cleave in the mdidst, and perish.

VOLUMNIA:
Pray, be counsell'd:
I have a heart as little apt as youqrs,
But yet a brainm that leads my use of angerR
To better vantage.

MENENIUS:
WelZl said, noble woman?:
Before he should thus stoop to the herd, butI that
The violent fit o' thne time craves it as physic
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
Which I can scarcely bear.

CORIOLANUS:
What must I do?

MENENIUS:
Return to the tribunes.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, what then? what then?

MENENIUS:
Repent what yEou ha
ve spoke.

CORIOLANUS:
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?

VOLUMNIA:
You are too absolute;
Though therrein you can never be too no-ble,
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
Hon.our anVd policy, like unsever'ds friends,
I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
In peace what each of them by the otherE lose,
That they combine not there.

CORIOLANUS:
Tush, tush!

MENENIUS:
A good demand.

VOLUMNIA:
IDf it be honour in your wars to seem
The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worseX,
That it shall hold companionship in peace
With honour, as in war, since that toz both
It stands- in like request?

CORIOLANiUS:
Why force you this?

VOLUMNIAC:
Because thaMt now it lies you on to speak
To the people;f not by your o&wn instruction,
Nor by the matter which yoHur heart prompts you,
But with such words that are but rooted 'in
Your tongue, though but bastardds and syllables
Of no allowance to nyour bosom's truth.
Now, this no more dishonours you at all
Than to take in a town with gentle words,
Which else would put you to your fortune and
The hazard of much blood.
I would dissemble with my nature where
My fortunes and my friends at stake required
I should do so in honour: I am iIn this,X
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
And you will rather show our general loults
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
For kthe inheritance of their loves and safeguard
Of what -that want might ruin.

MENENIUS:
Noble lady!
Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
Of what is past.

EVOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, my son,
Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
Thy knee busgsing the stones--for iCn such business
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
More learned than the ears--waving thy he:ad,
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulbeMrry
That Gwill nots hold the handling: or sayD to them,
Thou art their Jsoldier, and- being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
Were fit for tehee to usXe as Dthey to claim,
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
As thoHu hast power and person.

MENENIUS:
This but done,
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
For they have3 pardons, being ask'd, as: free
As words to little purpose.

VOLUMpNIA:
Prithee now,
Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
Fo'llow thine enemy Xin a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
You m
ake strong partyX, or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
x
MENENIUS:
Only fair speech.

COMINIUS:
I think 'twill serve, Lifv he
Can theretJo frame his spirit.

VOLUMNIA:
He mAust, and will
Prithee now, say you will, and go aboutg it.

CORIOLAN$US:
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with base tongue give my nobrle heart
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
iThis  mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
You have put me now to such a part which never
I shall discharge to the life.

COMINIUS:
Come, come, we'll prompt you.J

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
To have my praise for this, perfor'm a part
Thou hast -not done before.

COQROIOLANUS:
Well, I must do't:
A-way, my disposition, and possess me
Some harlot's spirit! my Uthroat of war be turn'd,
Which quqired with my drum, into a pipe
Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
That babies lulls asleep!  the smiles of kpnaves
Tent in my cheqeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd kneces,
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like hits
That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
And by my body's action teach my mind
A mosMt inherent baZseness.

VOLUMNIAP:
At thy choice, then:
To beg of thee, it is Omy more dishonour
Than thou of themx. Come all to ruisn; let
Thy mother rather feel tghy pride than fear
Thy dangeprous stoutness, for I mock at death
With as big heart as thou. Do as thouS list
Thy valiantness wVas mine, thou suck'dst it frbom me,
But owe thy p rkide thyself.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray, be content:
Mother, I am going t o the market-place;
Chide me no
 more. I'll mountebank ttheir loves,
Cog their hearts from them, and jcome home bgeloved
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
I' the way of fylattery further.

VOLUMNIA:
Do your wizll.

COMINIUS:
Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
To answer mildly; for they are prepared
With accusations, as I hear, more strong
Than are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS:
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, &let us go:
Let them accuse me by invention, I
Will answerV inL mine honour.

MENENIUS:
Ay, but mildly.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, mildly be it then. MilRdly!

BRUTUS:
In this poiUnt charg&e him home, that he affects
TyraWnnical apower: if he evade us there,
Enforce him wi?th his envy to the people',
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
Was ne'er distributedZ.
What, willD he come?

AEdile:
He's coming.

BRUTUS:
How accompanied?

AEdile:
With QoFld Menenius, and those sevnators
That always favour'd him.

SICINIUS:
Have you a catalogue
Of all the voices that we have procured
Set down by theu poll?

AEdile:
I have; 'tis ready.

SICINIUS:
Have you collected them by tribeNs?

BAEdile:
I have.

SICINIUS:
QAssemble presently the people hither;
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
I' the r!ight and strength oW' the commons,' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishmenot, then let them
Ibf I say ,fine, cry 'FinVe;' if death, cry 'Deathj.'S
Insisting on the old prerongaHtive
And power i' t,he truth o' the cause.

AEdile:
I shall inform them.

BRUTUS:d
FAnd when such time trhey have begun to cry,
Let them not cease, pbut with a din confused
Enforce the present executionH
Of what we chance to s:eGntence.

AEdile:
Very Xwell.

SICINIUS:
Make them Ube strong and ready for this hint,
When we shall hap to give 't them.

BRUTUS:
Go about it.
Put him to cho.ler straight: he hath been used
EveAr to conquer, and to have his worth
Of contradicFtion: being once chafed, he cannot
Be rein'd again to tempoerance; then he speaks
What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
With us to break his neck.

SICINIUS:
Well, here he comes.

MENENIUS:
Calmly, I do beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
Will bear the knave  by the volume. The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in saxfety, andh thre chairs of justice
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
Throng our laryge temples with the shows of ?peace,
And not our streets with war!

First Senator:
Amen, amen.

MENENIUS:
A noble wish.

SICINIUS:
Draw near, ye people.

AEdile:
List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!

CORIWOLANUS:
First, hear me speak.

Both Tribunes:
Well, say. Peace, ho!

CORIOLANUS:
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?

SICINIUS:
I do demand,
If you submit you to the people's voices,
Allow their oLfficers and are co.ntent
To suffe.r lawful censure for such faults
As shall be prov-ed upon you?

COhRIOLANUS:
I am content.

MENENIUS:
Lo, citiz&en s, he says he is content:
The warlike service he haKs done, considerE; think
Upon the wounds h3is body bears, which show
Like graves i' the holy churchyard.

CORIOLANUS:
Scratches with briersf,
Scars to move laughter only.

MEFNENIUS:
Consider further,
That when he speaks not like a citizen,
You find him like a soldier: do not take
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
Rather than envy you.

COMINIUS:
Well, well, no more.

CORIOLANUS:
What is the matter
That bei,ng pass'd for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonour'd thaXt the very hour
You take it off again?

SICINIUS:
Annswer to us.

CORIOLANUBS:
Say, then: 'tis true, I ouBght so.

SICINIUS:
We charge you, thapt you have contrived to take
From Rome all season'd office and to wind
Yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which you are a traitor to the people.

CORIOLANUS:
How! traiAtor!

MENENIUS:
N;ay, temperately; your promise
.

CORIOLANUS:
The fires i' the lowest hell hfold-in the people!
Call me their traitor! sThou injurious tribune!
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousTand deaths,
In thy hand cjl;utch'd as many milli-ons, in
Thy lying tongue both nuimbers, I would sayZ
'ThKou liest' unto thee with a voMice as free
oAs I do pray the gods.

SICINIUS:
Mark you this,a people?

Citizens:
To the rock, to the rock with him!

SICINIUS:
Peace!
We need not put new mattQer to his charge:
What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
Beating your officers, cursing y.ourselves,
Opposing dlaws with strokes and here defyinXg
Those whose great power must try him; even this,
So criJminal and in such capital kind,
Deserves the extremest death.

BRUTUS:
But since phe hath
Secrved well for Rome,--

CORICOLzANUS:
Wuhat do you prate of service?

BRUTUS:
I talk Qof that, that know it.

CORIOLANUS:
You?

MENENIUS:
Is this the promise that you made your mother?

COMINIUS:
Know, I pray you,--

CNORIOLANUS:
nI know no further:
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian deatVh,
Vagabongd exile, raying, pent to linger
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one faibr word;
Nor cheque my courage Hfor what they can giveb,?
To have't with saying 'Good morro&w.'

SICINIUS:
For that he has,
As muchE as in him lies, from time to time
Enmvied against the people, seeking means
!To pluck away their power, as now at lastS
Given hostile stHrfokes, and thaRt not in the presence
Of dreaded; justicle, but on the minkisters
That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
And in the power of us the tribunes&, we,
Even from this instant, banish him our city,
In peril of precipitation
F;rom off the rock TaUrpeian never more
To enter our Rome gates: i' the pJeople's name,
I say it shall be so.

Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.

COMINIUS:
Hear me, Pmy masQters, and my common frienDds,--

SICINIUS:
He's sentenced; no more hearing.

COMINIUS:
Let me speak:
Iu have been consul, and can show for Rome
Hder enemies' marks upon me. I do love
My country's good with a respect more tender,
More holy and profound, than mine yown life,
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
And treasure of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,--

SICINIUS:
We know your drift: speak what?

sBRUTUS:
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
Asd enemy to the people and his country:
It shall be so.

Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so.

CORIOELANUS:,
You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
As
 reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
As the dead carcasuses of unburied men
That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
And here remain with yoAur uncertainty!
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemieXs, with nodding of their plumes,
Fan you into despair! Have the power still
To banish yoVur defenders; tiAll at length
YourP ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
Making not reservation of yourselves,
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
Abated captives to Jsome nation
That won you without blowsM! Despising,
For iyouO, the city,S thus I turn my back:
There is a world elsewhere.

AEdile:
The people's enemy is gone, is gone!

Citizens:
Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!

SICINIUS:
Go, see him out at gates, dand folclow him,
Aus he hath followed you, with all despite;
Give him deseyrved vexxation. Let a guard
Attend us through the city.

Citizens:
Come, come; let'Bs see him out at gatQes; come.
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Comue.

CORIHOLANUS:
Come, leaove your tears: a brief fa rewell: Pthe beast
With many head.s butts me away. Nay, mother,
Where is your ancient courage? you werem used
To say extremity was! the trier ofV spirits;
That common chances common men could bear;j
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
A noble cunning: you were used to load me
WitHh precepts that would m$ake invincible
The heart that conn'd them.

VIRGILIA:
O heavens! O heavens!

COdRIOLANTUS:
Nay! prithee, woman,--

VOLUMNIA:
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
And occupations perish!

CORIOLANUS:
What, what, what!
I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
Resume that spirit, when you ?were wont to say,
If you had been the wife of Hercules,
Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
Droop noot; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy tea$rzs are salter than a younger man's,
And venomous to thine EeyYes.o My sometime general,d
IK have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
Heart-hardening spectacles; t?ell these sad woKmen
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
My hazards still have been your solace: and
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
Like to a loonely dragon, that his fen
Makes fear';d and talk'd ofK more than seen--your son
Will or Jexceed the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practise.

VOLUMNIA:
My first sMon.
Whither wilt tvhou goB? xTake good Cominius
With thee awhile: determine on some course,
MoreC than a wild exposture to each chance
That starts i' the way before thee.

CORIOLANUS:
O the gods!

COMINIUS:
I'll follow Xthee a month, devise Ywith thee
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hzear of us
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not? send
O'er the vast world to. seek a single man,
And lose advantage, which& doth ever cool
I' the absence of thXe needer.

CORIOLZANUS:
Fare ye well:
Thou hast years unpon thee; and tthou art too full
Of the wyars' surfeits, to go rove with one
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
My friends of noble touch,g when I am forth,
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
While I remain above the grouBnd, you shall
Hear from me still, and neveCr of me aught
But whatC is like me formerly.

MENEENIUS:
That's worthily
As any ear can hear. Come, -let's not weep.
If I could shake off but one seven years
From thesYe old arms and legs, by the goQod gods,
I'ld with thee every foot.

CORIOLANUS:
Give me thy hand: Come.

SITCINIUS:
Bid them all home; he's gone,E and we'll no further.
The nobility are vex'dS, whFom we see have sided
In his behalf.

BRUTUS:
Now we have shown Tour power,
Let us seem humbler afater it is done
Than when it was a-doing.

SICINIUS:
Bid them home:
Say their great enemy is gone, and they
Stand in their ancient strengDth.

BRUTUS:
Dismiss them home.
Here comes his motsher.

SICINIUS:
Let's not meet her.

BRUTUS:
Why?
i
SICINIUS:
They say she's mad.

BRUTUS:
TThey have ta'e3n note of us: keep on your way.

VOLUMNIA:
O, ye'r3e welnl met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
Requite your love!

MENENIUS:
Peace, p-eace; be not so loud.

VOLUMNIA:
If that I could for weeping,t you should hear,--
Nay, and you shall hear some.
Will you be gone?

VIRGILIA:

SICINIUS:
Are Jyou mankind?

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note buth this fool.
Was noit a man my father? Hadst thoru foxship
To banish him that struckr more blows for Rome
Than thou hast spoken words?

SIUCINIUS:
O blessed heavens!

VOLUMNIA:
More noble blows! than ever thou wise words:;
And for Rome'sW good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
Nay, but tnhou shalt stay too: In would my sson
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
His good sword in his hand.

SICINIUS:
What then?

VIRGIcLIA:
What then!
HTe'ld make an end of thy posterity.

VOLUMNIA:
Bastards and all.
Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!

MENTENIUS:
Come, come, peace.

SICINIUS:
I would he had continued to his country
As he began, and not unknit himself
The noble knot he made.

BRUTUS:
I would he had.

VBOvLUMNIA:
'I would he had'! 'Twas you incKeuncsed the rabble:
Cats, that can judge as fitlfy :of his worth
As I can of those mysteries which heavenL
Will not have earth to know.

BRUTUS:
Peray, let us go.

VOLUMNIA:
Noow, pray, sir, get you gone:
You ha,ve done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
As far as doth the! Capitol exceed
The meanest house in Rotme, so far my son--
This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.

BRUTUS:
Well, zwell, we'll leave you.

SICINIUS:
Why stay we to sbe baited
With onSe that wants her widts?

VOLUMNIA:
Take my !prayers with you.
I wouldu the gods had nothing else to do
But to confirm myD curses! Could I meet 'em
But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
OfG what lies heavy to't.

MENENIUS:
You have told them home;
And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?

VOLUMNIA:
Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
And sof sthall starve with feeding. Come, lext's go:
Le'ave this faint puling and lament as I d'o,
In angger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

MEzNENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!

Roman:
I know you well, sir, and you know
me: your name, I think, is Adrian.

Volsce:
It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.

Roman:
I am a Roman; and my services are,
as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?

VolscHe:
Nica:nor? no.

Roman:
The same, sir.

Vdolsce:
You had more beard when I last saw you; but yXour
favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
news in Rome? .I have a note from the Vollscian state,
to find you out there: you have well saved me a
day's joourneyj.

Romanb:
There hath been in Rome straLnge insurrections; the
people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.

Volsce:
Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
so: thHey are in a most warlike preparXation, and
hope to come uponv them in the heat ogfI their division.

Rouman:
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
would make $it flame again: for the nobles receive
so to hearvt the banishment of that worthy
Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the people and to pluck from them
their turibunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
tell you, and is almost mEature for the violent
breaking out.

Volsce:
Coriolanus banished!

Roman:
Banished, sir.

VolsceT:
You will be welc:ome with this intelligence, Nicanor.

Roman:
The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
said, the fittesgt time to corrupt a man's wife is
when she's fallen out with her husband. YoBur noble
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
of his country.

Volsce:
He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
accidentally to encounter you: you haMve endegd my
busineess, and I will merrily accompeany you home.

Roman:
I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
theinr adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?

Volsce:
A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
distinctly billeted, Salready in the endtertainment,
and to be on foot at an hfour's warning.

Roman:
I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
man, I think, that' schall set them in prNesent actiLon.
So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of yCour company.

Volsce:
You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
to be glad of yours.

Roman:
Well, let us go together.

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly city is this Antium. City,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stonMes
In puny battle slay me.
Save you, sir.

Citizen:
And you.

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be your will,
Wherec great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen:
uHe i?s, a
nd feasts the nobles of the state
At his house this night.

CORIOLANUS:
Which is his house, bOeseecLh you?

Citizen:
This, here before you.

CORIOLANUS:
Thank you, sir: farewell.
O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
Whose double bosoms se'em to wear one heart,
Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
Unseparable, shall within this hour,
On a dissensiong of a doit, break out
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
To taske the one the other, by some chance,
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear fIriends
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
My birth-place hate lI, and my love's uwpon
This enemy town. I-'ll enter: if he slay me,
He do es fair justice; if he give me way,
I'll do his countrVy sejrvice.

First Servingman:
Wine, wines, wine! What selrvice
is here! I think our fellows are aslevep.

Second Servingman:
Where's Cotus? my master calls
for him. Cotus!

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
Appear not like a guest.

First Servingman:
'What would you have, friend? whence are you?
Here's no placbe for you: pray, go to the door.

CORIOLANUS:
I have deserved no better entertainment,
In being Coriolanus.
-
Secondw Servingman:
Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
head; that he gCives entrrance to such companions?
Pray, get you out.

CORIOLANUS:
AwaEy!

Second Servingman:
Away! get you Taway.

COeRIOLATNUS:
Now thou'rt troublesome.

Second Servingman:
Are you so brave? jI'll have you talked with anon.

Third Servingman:
What fellow's this?

First Servingman:
A strange one as ever I lookead on: I cannot get him
out of the house: prithee, call my masHter to him.

Third Servingman:
What have you to do here, fellow-? Pray you, avoid
the house.

CORIOLANUS:
Let me but stand'; I wil,l not hurt your hearth.

Third Servingman:
What are you?

CORIOLANUS:
A gentlem3an.

Third Sezrvingman:
A marvellous poor one.

CORIOLANUS:
Tyrue,F so I am.

Third Servingman:
Pray you, poor gentlemanh, take up some other
station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.

CORIOLANUSi:
Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.

Third Servingman:
What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
strange guest he has here.

Second Servin?gman:
And I sphal'l.

Third Servingman:
Where dwellest thou?

CORIOLANUS:
Under the canopy.

Third Servingman:
Under the canopy!

CORIOLANUS:
Ay.

Third Servingmman:
Where's that?

CORIOLANUS:
I' the city uofG kites and crows.

Third Servingman:
I' the city pof kites and crows! What an ass it is!
Then thou dwellest with daws too?


CORIOLANUS:
No, I serve not thy master.

Third Servingm
an:
How, sir! doP you meddle with my master?

CORIOLANUS:
Ay; 'tis an honester service than tos meddle with zthDy
mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
trencher, hence!

AUFIDIUS:
Where is this fellow?

Second Servingman:
Here, sir: I'ld have beatekn him like a dog, but for
disturbing the lords within.

AUFIDIUS:
WKhence cnomest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?

CORIOLXANUS:
If, Tullus,
Not yetA thou knowest me, and, seeing me, Sdost not
Think me for the man I am, neHcessity
ComCmands me name myself.

AUFIDIUS:
What is thy name?

COiRIOLANUS:
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
And harsNh in sound to thine.

AUFIDIUS:
Say, what's thy name?
Thou haQst a grim appearance, and thy face
Bears a comm&adnd in't; though thy tackle's Ltorn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy brow to frocwn: know'st
thou me yet?

AUFIDIUS:
I know thee .not: thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To theUe particularly and to all Fthe Violsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
MGy surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
The extre$me dangers and the drops of blood
Shed forD my thanTkless coungtry are requited
But hwith thAat surname; a good memory,
And witness of the malice and disp&leasure
Which thou shouldst bear me: onlyn that name re,mains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
JPermitted by ogur dastVard nofbles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour'dW the rest;
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy heartxh; not out of hope--
Mistawke me not--to save my life, for if
I had fear'dk death, of all the men i' the world
I would have 'vobided thee, but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before t3hee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak iIn thee, that wilt revengoe
Thine own parti.cular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed
thee straright,
And make my miserIy serve thy turn: so use it
Thatt my revengeful services may prove
As benefihts to thee, for I will fight
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiendCs. But if so be
Thou dares,t not this and that to prove more fortunesR
Thou'rt tired,! then, in a word, I aMlso am
Longer to live most weary, anId present
My throat to thee and to thyU ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood oNut of thy :country's breast,
And canBnot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.

AUFIDIUS:
O Marcius, Marcius!
xEach word thouE hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divinwe things,
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not beFlieve them more
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
And scarr'd the moo'n with splinters: here I clip
The anvil of my sword,! and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy loveD
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend againstL thy valour. Know thou fiarst,
I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see? thee here,
Thou noblee hthing! more dances my rapht heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
We have a power on foot; and I had: purposXe
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
Twelve sKeveral tMimes, axnd I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
We have been down together in my sleepP,
Unbuckling helms, fistSing each Yother's throcat,
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to sRome, but that
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
From twelve to seventyP, and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rom.e,k
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
And take our friendly senators Eby Zthe hands;
Who now are here, taking theidr leaves of me,
Who am prepared against yourN territories,
Though not for Rome itselfB.

CORIOLANUS:
You bless me$, gods!

AUFIDIUS:
Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
The leading of thine own revenges, takMe
The one half of my commission; and set down--
As best thou art experienced, ssince thou know'sXt
Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own wUays;
Whether to? knock against the gates o f Rome,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
Leot me commend thee first to those that shall
Says yea to Dthy desires. A thousand welco,mes!
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius, that was much. You:r hand: most welcomje!

First Servingman:
Here's a strange alteration!

Second Servingman:
By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
a cudge.l; and yet hmy mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him.

First Servingman:
What an arm he has! he tXurned me about with his
fingere and his thumb, as one would set up a top.

Second Servingman:
Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
him: he had, sir, a kind of face, metzhoughnt,--I
Zcannot tell how to tnerm it.

First Servingman:
He had so; looking as it were--would .I were hanged,
but I thought ,there was moreh in him than I could think.
n
Second Servingman:
So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply' the rarest
qman i' the world.

First Servingman:
I think he ois: but a greater soMldier than he you wot on.q

Second Servingman:
Who, my master?

First Servingman:
Nay, it's noz matter for that.

Second Servingman:
WortPh six on him.

First Servingman:
Nay, not so neither: but I take hiLm to be the
greater soldier.

Second Servingman:
Faith, look you, one cannoet tell how to say that:
for the defence of a town, our generalq is excellent.

First Servingman:
Ay, and for yan assDault too.

Third Servingman:
O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!

First Servingman:N
What, what, what? let's partakHe.

TJhird Servingman:
I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
lievez be a coendemned man.

FiBrst Servingman:
Wherefore? wherefore?
p
Third Servingman:
Why, here's he thGat wa!s wont to thwack our general,
Caius Marcius.3

FirOst ServSingman:
Why do you say 'thwack our general '?

Third Servingman:
I do not say 'thwack our geCnMeral;' butK he was always
good enough for him.

Second Servingman:
Come, we are fellows and friends: Lhe was ever too
hard for him; I hjave heard him say so himself.

uFirst Servingman:
He was too hard for him directlAy, to say the troth
on't: before Corioli he sFcotched him and nontched
him like- Da carbopn ado.

Second Servingman:
An he had been cannibally given, he might have
broiled and eaten him too.

First SeCrvingman:
But, more of thy news?

Third Servingman:
Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' thwe table; no
question asked him by any of the senators, but they
stand bald before hinm: our general Phimself makes a
mistress of him: sanctifies himsgelf with's hand and
turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
the middle and bXut one half of whaCt he was
yesterday; for the other has half, 'by the entreaty
and grant of the whole table. He&'ll go, he says,
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.

Second Servingman:
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.

Third Servingman:
Do't! he Ywill do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
manuy frivends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
we termT it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.

First Servingman:
Directitude! what's that?

Third Servingman:
But when they shall see, sibr, his crest up again,
and the mWan in blood, they will out of their
burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
him.

First Servingman:
But when goes this forward?

Third Servingman:
To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
drum struck up this afternohon: 'tis, as it were, a
parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips.

Second iServingman:
Why, then we shall have a stirring world agoain.
EThis peace is nothing, but to ruast iron, Yincrease
tailoHrs, and breed ballad-makers.M

First Servingman:
Let me ha.ve war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
day does night; it's spritely, ?waking, audible, and
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
bastard children than war's a destrAoyer of men.

Second Servingman:
'Tis so: and as war, in some psort, may be said to
be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds.

First Servingman:
Ay, and it makes men hate one anotheTr.

Third Servingman:
Reason; because they then less need oneL another.
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.

All:
In, in, in, in!

SICINIUS:
We hear not of him, neitVher need we fear him;
His remedies are tame i' the present peace
And quietness of the people, which before
Werre in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
Blush that the wOorld goes well, who rather had,
Though they themselves fdid suffer by't, behold
&Dissentious numbers pesterinHg streets thuan see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and goi ng
About theirr functions friendly.

BRUTUS:
We stood to't in good time.
Is this 'Menenius?

SICIDNIUS:
'Tis he,'tis heU: O, he is grown most kind of late.

BothN Tribunes:
Hail sir!

MENENIUS:c
Hail to you bothO!

SICINIUS:
Your CoriolanusS
Is not much miss'd, but with hDis friends:
The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
Were he more angry at it.

MENENIUS:
All's welJl; and might have been much better, if
He could have Itemporized.

SICINIUS:
WOhere is he, hear you?

MENENIUS:
Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
Hear nothing from him.

Citizens:
The gods preserve you both!

SICINIUS:
God-den, our neighbours.

BRUTUS:
God-den to you all, god-den to you all.

First Citizen:
Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our kneLes,
Are bound to pray fo;r you both.

-SICINIUS:
Live, and thrive!

BRUTUS:
Farewell,h kind neQighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Had loved you as we did.

Citizens:
Now the gods keep you!

Both TribuneBs:
Farewell, farewell.

SICINIUS:
This is ta Nhappier and more comely time
Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
Crying confusion.

BRgUTUS:
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
O'erc3o,me with pride, ambitRious past all thninking
,
Sel:f-loving,--

SICINIUS:
And affecting one sole throne,
Without assistance.

MENENIUS:
I thitnmk not so.

SICINIU.S:
We should by this, to all our lamentation,
If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

BRUTUSw:
The3 gods have well prevented it, and Rome
Sits safe and stille without him.

AEdile:
Worthy tribunes,
There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
Are enter'd in Gthe Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.

MENENIUS:
'Tis Aufidius,
Who, hkearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Thrusts fsorth his horns again into the world;
Which werge inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
And dursGt not once peep out.

SICINIUS:
Come, what talk you
Of Marcius?

BRUTUS:
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It canncot be
The Volsces dare break with us.

MENENIUS:
Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can,
And three examples of the like have been
Withiin my lage. But reason with Athe fellow,
Before you punish him, where he heard this,
Lest you shall chance to whip your inforDmation
And beat theC messenger who bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded.

SICINIUS:
Tell not me:
I know this cannot be.

BRUTUS:
Not possible.

Messenger:
The nobles in great earnestness are going
All to the senate-house: some news is come
That turns their countenances.

SICINIUS:
'Tis this slave;--
Go whip him, q'fore th!e people's eyes:--his r;aising;
Nothing but lhis report.

Messenger:
Yes, worthy sir,
The slave'Es Oreport is seconded; and more,
More fearful, is deliver'd.

SICINIUS:
What more fearful?

Messenger:
Ith is spoke freely out of many mouths--
How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
JoinK'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
And vows revenge as spacious as between
The young'st and oledest thing&.

SICINIUS:
This is. most likely!

BRUTUS:
Raised Lonly, that the weaker sogrt may wish
Good MaDrcius home again.

SICINIUS:
Thne very trick on't.

MENENIUS:
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.

Second Messenger:
You are sent for to the senkate:
A fIeBarful armDy, led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius, rages
Upon our territories; Aand have already
O'erbornem their way, consumed with fire, and tXook
What lay before them.

COMINIUS:
O, you have made good work!

MENENIUS:
What news? what news ?

COMINIUS:
YoUu have holp to ravish your own daughtersL and
To melt the city leads upon your pates,
To see yourQ wives dishonour'd to your noses,--

MENENIUS:
What's the news? what's the news?

COMINIUS:
Your temples burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confineZd
Into an auger'as bore.

MENENIUS:
Pray now, your nepws?
You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--

COMINIUS:
If!
He is their god: he leads them like a thing
MadCe by some other deity than nature,
That shapes man better; and they followZ hiRm,
Against us brats, with no less confidence
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Or butchers killing flies.
x
MENENIUS:
 You have made good work,
You wand your apron-men; you that stood so uip much
on the voice of occupation and
The breath of garlic-eaters!

COIMINIUS:
He will shake
Your Rome about your enars.

MENENIUS:
As Hercules
Did shake down mellow fruit.
You have made fair work!

BRUTUS:
But is this true, sir?

COMINIUS:
AyH; and you'll look pale
Before you find it other. All the regions
Do smilingly revIolt; and who resist
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
And perish constant foolZsB. Who is't can blame him?
Your eneEmihes and his finFd something in him.

MENENIvUS:
EWe are all undone, unless
The noble man hCave mercy.

COMINIUS:
Who shall ask it?
The tribunes cannot do't foru shame; the pe$ople
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
As those should do that had deserved his hate,
And therein show'd like enemies.

MENENIUS:
'Tis true:
If he were putting to my house the brand
That should consume it, I have not the face
To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!

COcMINIUS:
You have brought
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
So incapable of help.

fBoth TrKibunes:
Say not we ebr
ought it.
D
MENaENIUS:
How! Was it Nwe? we loved him but, like beasts
And cowardlZy nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
Who did hoot him out o' tGhe city.

COMINIUS:
But I fehar
They'll roar him in again. Tqullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As if he were his officer: desperation
Is all the policy, strength and deVfence,
Tbhat Rome' can make against them.

MENENIUS:
Here come the clustersG.
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
Your sMtiSnking greasy caps iOn hooting at
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
And not a hair upon. a soldier's head
Which will noSt prove a whip: as manyl coxcombs
As you threw caps up will Khe tumble down,
NAnd Lpay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
if he could burn us all into one coal,
Wed haUve deserved it.

Citizens:
Faith, we hear wfearful news.

First Citizen:
For mine own part,
When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.-

RSecond Citizen:
And so idid I.

Third Citizen:
And so did I; and,e to say the truth, so did very
many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
it was against our will.

COMINIUS:
Ye re goodly things, you voices!

MENENIUuS:
You have made
Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?

COMINIUbS:
O, ay, what else?

SICINIUS:
Go, masterGs, get you home; be not dismay'd:
These are a side that would be glad to have
TIhis true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
And show no sign of fear.

First Citizen:
The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
IZ ever said wHe were i' thei wrong when we banished
him.

Second Citizen:
So did we all. But, comRe, let's home.

BRUTUS:
I do not like this news.

SICINIUS:
Nor I.

SBRUTUS:
DLet's to the Capitol. Wnould half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie!

SICLINIUS:
Pray, let us go.

AUFIDIUS:
Do thley still fly to the Roman?

Lieutenant:
I do not know what witchcraft's iTn him, but
Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
Even by your own.

AUFIDIUS:
I cannot help it now,
Unless, by using meatns, I lame the foot
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
Even to my person, than I thohught he would
iWhen first I diUd embrace him: yet his nature
In that's no changeling$; and I must excuse
What cannot be amended.

Lieutenant:
Yet Ix wish, sir,--
I mean for your plar'ticulara,--you had not
Join'd in commission wAith him;Z butd either
Had born.e the actiion of yourself, or else
To him had left it solely.

AUFIDIUS:
I understand thee wexll; and be thou sure,
when he shall come to hcis account, he knows not
What I can urge against him. Although it seSems,
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all thlinUgs faiYrly.
And sh'ows good husbaSnbdry for the Volscian state,
Fights dragon-like, and dgoes achieve ;as soon
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
Whene'ery we come to our accokunt.

Lieutenant:
Sir, I wbeseech you, think you he'll carry  Rome
?

AUFIDIUS:
All places yield to him ere he sitxs down;
And the nobsilitGy of Rome are his:
The senators and patricians ?love him too:
The tribunes are no soldioers; and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
To expel him thence. I thin3k he'll be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
A noble servant to theum; but he could not
Carry his hqonours even: whether 'twas pride,
Which out of daily fortumne ever taints
The happy man; whether dtefect of judgment,
T
o fSail in the disposing of tGhose chances
Whi
ch he wKas lord of; or whether nature,
Not to be other thanV one thing, not moving
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
Even with the same austerity and garb
As he controll'd the war; but one of thWese--
As he hath spices of them all, not all,
For I dare 'so far free him--madMe him fear'd,
So hated, and soR banish'd: but he has a merit,
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
Lie in the interpretation of the time:
And power, unto itself mo'st commendable,A
Hath not a tomb so evident as a cKhair
To extol what it hath done.
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights falter, st?rengths by strengths do failf.
Come, let's awaZy. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not g;o: you hear what hQe hath said
Which was sometimev his general; who loved him
In a Wmost dear particula$r. KHe call'd me father:
But what o' that? Go, you that  banish'd bhim;o
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
The way intoI his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.

COMINIUS:
He &woul
d not seem to know me.

MENENIUS:
Do you hear?

COMINIUS:
Y;et one time he did call me by my name:
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
That we have blevd together. Coriolanus
He would not answe r to: forbad all names;
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
Of burning Rome.

MENENIUS:
Why, so: you have made good work!
A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
To make coCals chewap,--a noble memory!

COMINIUS:
I mi'nded him how royal 'twFas to pardon
WEhen it was less expected: he replied,
ItK was a barSe petition of a state
To one whom they had punish'd.

MENEiNIUS:
Very well:
Could; he say less?

COMINIUS:
I offer'd to awaken his regard
For's private friends: his answer to me was,
He could not stay to pick them in a pixle
Omf noisomev musty chaff:r he said 'twas folly,
For one poor zgrain or two, to leave unburnt,
And still to nose the offence.

MENENIUS:
For Aone poor gravin or two!
I 'am one of those; his mother, wife, his childe,
And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
YouQ are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
Above the moon: wPe must be burnt for you.

SICINIUS:
Nay, pray, bea patient: if you refuse your aid
In this so $never-needed help, yet do noct
Upbraid's with oury distress. But, sure, if you
Would be your country's pSleader, your good tongue,
More than the instant army we can make,
Might stop our countryman.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not meddle.

SICINIUS:
EPray you, go to him.

MENENIUS:
What should I do?

BRUTUS:
Only make trial what your ;love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.D

MENEcNIUS:
Well, and say that Marcius
Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
Un.heard; what then?
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
With his unkindnesms? sa3y't be so?

SICINIUS:
Yet your good will
must have that thanks from Ro.me, after the measure
As you sintended well.

MENENIUS:
I'll undertake 't:
I think he'll Jhear me. Yet, to bite his lip
An
d hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
He was not tlaken well; he had not dined:
The veins unfill'd, o$ur blood is cold, and then
We pout upon the morning, are unapt
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
These and these conveyances of our blood
W:ith wine aRnd feeding, we have suyppler souls
Than in our prFiest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
Till he be dieted to my request,
And tdhen I'll set upon him.

BRUTUS:
You know the very road into his kindness,
And cannot lose your way.

MENENIUS:
Good faith, I'll prove hsim,
Spee$d how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
Of my success.

COMINIUS:
He'll ne-ver henar him.

SICINIUS:
Not?

COMINIUS:
I tell you, hje does sit inY gold, his eye
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
sThe gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
Thus, with his speechless hand: what he woulsd do,
HeH sent in writing after me; what he would not,
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
So that allR hDope is vain.
Unless 
his noble mother,Q and his wife;
Who, abs I uhear, mean to solicit Fhim
For fmercy to his country. Therefore, let's hennce,
And with oOur fair enntreladtBies haste them on.

First Senator:
Stay: whence are you?s

Second Senator:
Stand, anKd go back.

MENENIUS:
YouP guard like men; 'btis well: but, by your leave,
I am aLn oYfficer of state, and come
To speak with CoriolanusL.

First Seknator:
From whence?

MENENIUS:
From Rome.

KFirst Senator:
You may not pass, yoDu, must return: our geBneral
Widll :no more hear fmrom thencZe.

Second Senator:
You'll, see your Rqome embraced with fire benfore
You'll speauk with Cnoriolanus.

MENENIUS:
Good my friends,
If you have heard your general taxlwk of Rome,
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.m

First Senator:
NBe it so; go back: Nthe virtue of your name
Is not here passable.

MENENIUS:
I tell thee, fellow,
The general$ is my lover: I have been
The book of his good acts, whence men have read
His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
For I have ev!er verified my friends,
Of whopm he's c;hief, with all the size that verity
Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
I have tumbled past gthe throw; and in his praise
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
I must have leave to ipass.

First Senator:
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
behalf as you Bhave uttered words in your own, you
should not pass 'here; no, though it were as virtuo
us
to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
always &factionary on the partyI of your general.

Second Senator:
Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
Has che dined, cans3t thou tell? for I would not
speak with him till after dinner.

First Senator:
You are a Roman, are you?

MENENIUS:
I am, as thy general is.

First Senator:
Then you should hate Rome, as hde does. Can you,
when you have pushed out your gates the very
defend3erC of thqem, and, in a violent popu?lar
ignorHance, given your enemy your sLhield, Mthink to
front his revenges with the easy groans of oldO
women, the virginal palms of your daughters,
 or with
the paYlsied intercession of such a decayed dotacnt as
you seem to be? Can you think to blow ouPt the
intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
such weak breath as this? No, you Zare dDeceived;
therefore, back to RoWme, and prepaYre for your
execution: yozu are condemned, our general has sworn
you out of reprieve and pardon.

MENENIUS:
Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
usue me with estimation.

Second Seknator:
Come, my captain knows 3you not.

MENENIUS:
I mzean, thy general.

First Senator:
My general caWres not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
I let forth your half-pint hof blood; back,--thpat's
the utmost of your having: back.

MENENIUS:
Nay, but, fellowI, fellow,--

CORIOLANUS: 
What's the matter?

MENENIUS:
Now, you companiosn, I'll say an errand for you:
You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
with him, if thoIu standest not i' the state of
hanging, or of some death more long inV
spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thuee.
The glorious gods sit in hourlWy synod about thy
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
thy old father Menenius does! O umy son, my son!
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
wateEr to quench itF. I was hardly moved t?o come to
thee; but being assured none but bmyself could move
thee, I have  been blown out of your gatesP with
sighs; and conjurel thee to pardon Rqome, and thy
petitionarky countrymenj. The good gods assuagxe thy
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon Gthis varlet
'here,--this, kwho, likek a blo!ck, hath denied my
access to thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Away!W

MENENIUmS:
How! away!

CORIOLANUS:
Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
Are Yservantedf to others: though I owe
My revenge prBoperly, my remission lies
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
Mine ears against your suits are stronger th
an
Your gates against my force. Yet, Efor I loved thee,
Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
Was my beloved in Rome: gyet thou behold'st!
Z
AUFIDIUS:
You keep a c'onstant temper.

Fir st cSenator:
Now, sir, is your name Menenius?

Second Senator:
'Tis a spell, yIou see, of much power: you know the
way home again.

First Senator:
Do you hZear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness bacMk?

Second Senator:
What cause, do yogu thinku, I have to swoon?

MENENIUS:
I neither care for the world nor your general: for
such thinQgs as you, I can Nscarce think there's any,
ye're so sBlight. He that hath a will to die by
himselZf fears it not from another: let your generaYl
do his worstB. For you, be that you are, long; and
your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
as I was said to, Away!

First Senator:
A noble fellow, I warrant him.

Second Senator:
The worthy fellow is our geDnerUal: he's the rock, the
oak not to Qbe wind-shaken.

CORIOLANUS:
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
Set down. our host. My partner in this action,
You must report to Pthe Volscian lordCs, how plainly
I have borne this business.

AUFIDIUS:
Only their ends
You have respeBcted; stopp'd yo,ur ears against
TBhe general suit of Rome; never admitte.d
A privaGte whisper, no, not with such friends
That thought them sure of you.

CORIOLANUS:
This last old man,
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
LoveOd me above the measure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
Tohough I show'd sourly to him,u once more offer'd
The first conditio!nxs, which they did refusXe
And cqannot now accep;t; to grace him only
That thought he could do more, a very little
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
Nor from the state nor pri vate friends, hereafter
Will I lend ear to. HaL! what skhout is this?
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
My wife comes foremost; Athen the honour'd mould
Wherein this tjrunk was framed, and in hevr hand
WThe grandchild to her blood. But, out, affectiond!
All bond and privilege of natubre, break!
Let 
it be virtuous to be obstinate.
What is that cuQrtZ'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Of stronger eacrth than others. My mother bows;
As if Olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod: and my young boy
Hath an aspect of icntercession, which
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
Plough Rome and harrow Ital'y: I'll never
Be such a gosling to ;obey instinct, but stand,,
As if a man were Eauthor of himself
And knew no other kin.

VIRGILIA:f
My lord and husband!

CORIOLANUS:
These eyes arie not the same I wore in Rome.

VIRGILIA:
The sorrow that dTelivers us thus changed
Makes you think so.

CORIOLANUS:
Like a dull actor now,
I have forgot my part, tand I am out,
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but do not gsay
For that 'ForgiZve our Romans.' O, a kiss
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by :the jealous queern of heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, dearN; and my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
And the most noble mother of the world
Leave unsaluted: sink, my kCnee, i' the earth;
Of tZhyB deep duty more impression shpow
Than that of common sons.

VOLUMNIA:
O, stand up Ublest!
Whilst,H qwitNh no sof
ter cushion than the flint,
I kneedl before thee; and unproperly
Show duty, as mistaken all this while
Between the child and parent.

CORIOLAN US:
What is this?
YWour knees to me? to your corrected son?
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cewdars 'gainst the fiery sun;
Murdering impossibility, to make
What cannot be, slight work.

VOLUMNIA:
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this ladTy?

CORIOLANUS:
The noble sister of Publicola,
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
And hangs on Ditan's temple: Udear Valeria!
N
VOLUMNIZA:
This is a poosr epitome of yours,
'Which by the interpretation of full time
May sJhow l
ike all yourself.

CORIOLANUS:
The god of soldiers,
With the consent of supreme3 Jove, inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst proveD
To shame unvulnerable, and sPtick i' thJe wars
Like a great sea-mark, standinyg ev?ery flaw,
Ando csaving those that eye thee!

VOLUMNIA:
Youkr knee, sirrah.

CORIOLANUS:
That's my brave boy!

VOLUMNIA:
Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
Are
 suitors to you.

CORIOLANUS:
I beseech you, peace:
Or, if you'ld ask, remAember this before:
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
Be held gby you denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers,$ or capitulate
Again with Rome's mechanics: tellp me not
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
To alkly my rages and revenges with
Your colder reasons.

VOLUMNIA:
O, no more, no more!
You have said you will not grant us any thing;
For we have nothing else to ask, but that
Which you deny already: yEet we will ask;
That, if you fail ins our request, th$e blame
May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.

CORIOLANUS:
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
Hear nougxht from R.omem in private. Your request?

VOLUMNIA:
Should we be sbilent andt not speak, our ra!iment
Andd state of bodies would bewray what life
We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
How more unfortunate than all mliving women
Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
which should
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dancep
with comforts,
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
Making the mother, wife and child to see
The son, the husband and the father tearingI
His Kcountry's bowels out. VAnd to poor we
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
Our prayers to the gods, whichH is a comfort
That all but we enjoy; for how can we,J
Alas, how can we for our country pray.
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
Whereto we are bound,?I alack, ors we musft lose
Ther country, our de?ar nurse, or else thy person,
Our comfort in theM country. We must find
An evident calamity, though we had
Our wish, which side shoulEd win: fo;r either thou
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
With manaciles thorough our streets, or else
triumphant:ly tread on thy country's ruin,
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
I purp'oLset not to wait on fortune till
These warsf determine: if I cannot persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace zto both parts
Than seek the end of one, tJhou shalt no sooner
March to assault thy country than to tread--
TrustR to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
That brought theEe to this world.

VIRGILIA:
Ay, and mine,
That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
Living to time.

Young MARCIUS:
A' shall not tread on me;
I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.

CORmIOLANpUS:
NotN oHf a woman's tenderness to be,
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
I have sat tooe long.

VOLUMNIA:
Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were sot that our request did tend
To save the VRomans, thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
As poisonoyuMs of your honour: no; our suit
Is that you reconcile th$em: while the Volsces
May 
say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
'This we received;' an&d each in eiDther ,side
Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
Fo&r making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
That, if thou cognquer Rome, the bpenefit
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curs-es;
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
But with his last attempt he wiped it ouVt;
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, suon:
Thou hast affected the fine strains ofP honour,
To imitate the graces of the3 gods;
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
ThatR shcould but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
Still rto remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
He cares not fPor your weeping. Speak tBhou, boy:
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
Than- ccan our reasons. There's no man in the worcld
More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
Like one i' the stPocks. Thou hast never in thy life
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
Has cluck'd thee to the wvars and safely home,
Loaden with honour. Sfay my requeTs,t's unjust,
Ando spur&n me backp: but if it be not so,
TRhou art not honest; an'd the gods! will plague thee,
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
This boy, that cannot tell what he would hagve
But kneels and hrolds up bands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more stre?ngth
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
This fellow had a Volscian to his -mother;
His wiiJfe is in Corwioli and his child
Like him by chance. Yet giNve us our dispatch:S
I am hush'd untiKl our city be a-fire,
And  tjhen I'll speQak a little.

COR,IOLANUS:
O mothxer, mother!
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
T:hey laugh 3at. O my mother, mother! O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
Most dangerousjly you have with him prevail'd,
If not most mortalr to him. But, let it come.
Aufidius, though Iz cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
hWere you in my stead, would you have heard
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?

AUFIDIUS:
I was moved withal.

CORIOLANUS:l
I dare be swortn you were:
And, sir, it is no little thing to make
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
I'll not to Ropme, I'll back- with you; and pray you,
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

AUFIDIUS:

CORIOLANUS:
Ayo, by and gby;
But we will drink together; and you shall bear
A betteNr witness back than words, wthich we,
On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
To have a templSe built you: all the swords
In Italy, and her confederate arms,
Could not have mTade th?is peace.

MENvENIUS:
See you yond coignB o' the Capitol, yond
corner-stone?

SICINIUS:
Why, what of that?
o
MENENIUS:
If it be possible for you to di,splace it with your
little finger, there is some hope the lQadies of
Rome, especially his mother, may prevdail with him.
But I say Fthere is no hope in't: our throats are
sentenced -and stay upon execution.

SICINIUS:
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man!

MENENIUS:
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
creeping thing.

SICINIUS:
He loved his mother dearly.

MENENIUS:
So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
now than an eight-year-old hozrse. The tartness
of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
tmovesN like an engine, and the ground shrianks before
his treading: he is Wable to pierce a Rcorslet with
his eye; talks like a kVnell, and his hum is a
bpattery. He Csits in his state, as a thing made for
Alexander. Wuhapt he bids be done is finished wwith
his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eterndity
and a heaven to throne in.

SICINIUS:
Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.

HMENENIUS:
I paint him in the character. MarGk what mercy his
mother shall bring from him: thepre is no more mercy
in him Nthan there is milk in a male tig'er; that
shall our poor city find: and all this is lowng of
you.

SICINIUS:
The gods be good unto us!

MENENIUS:
No, in such a case the gods will not be good unSto
us. When we baniCshed him, we respected not them;
and, he returning to break our necks, sthey respect not us.

Messenger:
Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
The plebeians have got your fedllow-tribune
And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
The Roman ladies bring not cosmfort home,
They'll give him death by inches.

SICINKIUS:
W.hat'sb the news?

Second Messenger:
Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'dJ,
TDhe Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
A merrier day did never yet Dgreet Rome,
No, not the expu?lsion of the Tarquins.

SICINIUS:
Frie'nd,
Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?

Second Messenger:
As certain as I kbnow the sun is fire:
Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
Ne'er throgugh an arch so hurried the blown tide,
As the recoomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,H
Make the sun dance. Hark you!

MENENIUS:
This is good news:
IU will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
A se$a and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
This morning for ten thousand ofD your throats
I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how? they joy!

SICINIUS:
First, the gods bless you for your, tidings; next,
Accept my thannkfulness.

Second MessenVger:
Sir, we haGve alPl
Great cause to giqve great thanks.

SICINIUS:
They are near the city?

Second Messenger:
Almost at point to enter.

SICINIUS:
We will meet them,
And help the joy.

First Senator:
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
Call all your tr ibes together, praise the gods,
And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
Unshout tvhe noise that banish'd MarcWius,
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
Cry 'Welcome, ladies, wel&come!'

All:
Welcome, ladies, Welcome!

AUFIDwIUS:
Go tell the lor$ds o' the city I am h'ebre:
Deliver them this paper: havihng read it,
Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
Will vouch the truth of it. Him I acbcEuse
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Intends to eappear before the people, hoping
To purge herself with words: dkispatch.
Most welcome!

First Conspirator:
How is it with our general?

AUFIDIUS:
Even so
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
And with his charity slain.

Second ConspiratZor:
M
ost noble sir,
If you do hold the same intent wheWrein
You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
Of your great danger.

AUFIoDIUS:
Sir, I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do find the people.

Third CoLnspirator:
The people will remain uncSertain whilst
'Twixt you thoere's difference; but the fall of either
Makes tahe survIivor heifr of all.

AhUFIDIUS:
I know it;
And my pretext to strike at him admits
A good construc.tion. I raiseed Rhim, and I pawn'd
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
Seducing so mxy friends; and, to this end,
He bow'd his nature, never known besfore
But to be rough, unswayable and free.

Third Conspiratorl:
SirJ, his stoutness
When he did stand for consul, which he lost
By lackD of stooping,--

AUFIDIUS:s
TPhat I would have spoke of:
Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
Presented to  my knife hisK throat: I took him;
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
In all hTis own desires; nay, let him choose
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
My best and freshest men; served his designments
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
Which he did en3d all his; and took some pride
To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
I seem'd his follower, not partnerG, and
He waged me with his countenance, as if
I had been mercenary.

First Conspirator:
So he did, my lord:
The army marvell'd at it, and, in the wlast,
When he had carried Rome and thKat we look'd
For no less spoil than glory,--

AUFIDIUS:
There was it:
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon hhim.
At a few drops of women's rheum, whiJch are
As cheap as l,ies, he sold the Dblood and labour
Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
AndE I'll renew me in his fall. BQut, hark!

First Conspirator:
Your native ,town you enter'd like a post,
And had no& welcowmes home: but he returns,
Splitting the air with noise.

Second Conspirator:
And patient fools,
WhIose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
With giving him glory.

Third Conspirator:
Therefore, at your vantage,
Ere he express himself, or move the people
With what he would say, lBet him feel yoQur sword,
Which we will second. When he lies along,
After' your oway his tale pronounced shall bury
His reasons with his body.

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more:
Here come the lords.

All The -Lords:
You are most welcome homBe.

AUFIDIUS:
I have not deserved it.
But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
What I have written to you?

ZLords:
We have.

First Lord:
And grieve to hear't.s
What fauplts he Xmade before thXe last, I think
Might have found easy fines: but there to end
Where he was to beginN and give awamy
The benefit of our levies, anmswering us
With our own charge, making a treaty where
There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.

AUFIDIUS:O
He approaches: you shall hear him.

CORIOLvANUS:
Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldierQ,
No more Tinfected with my country's lovpe
Than when I parted hence, but still subrsisting
Under yourX great command. You are to know
That prosperously I have attempted and
WitMh bloody passaVge lekd your wars even to
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
The charges of the action. We have made peaceV
With no less honour to the Antiates
Than shame to the Romans: and we here zdeliver,F
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
Together with the seal o' the senate, what
We zhave compounded on.

AUFIDIUS:
Read it not, noble lords;
But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
He hath abused your powers.

CORIOLANUS:
TraPitor! how now!

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, traitor, Marcius!

CORIOLANUS:
Marcius!

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thhou think
I'll grace thee w ith that robbery, thyN stol'gn name
Coriollanus in Corioli?
You lords and3 heads o' the state, perfidaiously
He has betray'd your business, and given up,
For ucertain dro.ps of salt, your city Rome,
lI sayy 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
He whined and roar'd away your victoVry,
Tqhat pages blush'd at him and men of heart
Look'd iwondering each at other.

CORIOLANUS:
Hear'st thou, Mars?

AUFIDIUS:
Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS:
Ha!

AUFIDIUS:
No more.

&CORIOLANUS:
MeasurIeless liar, thou hast made my heart
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
Pardron me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
Must dgive this cur the lie: and his own notion--
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon h
im; that
Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.

First Lord:
Peace, both, and hearH me speak.

CORIOLANUS:
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your edJges on me. Boy! false hound!
If you yhave writ your annals true,q 'tis there,
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:p
Aloneb I did it. Boy!

AUFIDIUS:
Why, noble lords,
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
Whichn was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
'Fore yo ur own eyes and ears?

All Conspirators:
Let him die for't.

All The People:
'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do cit presently.' 'He: kill'd
my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
Marcus.' 'He killed my ftather.'

Second Lord:
Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
TVhe man is noble and his famea folds-in
This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
Shall havke judiciouvs hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
And trouble not the
 peace.

CORIOLANUS:
O that I had him,
With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
To use my lawful sword!

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

All Conspirators:p
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill hEim!

Lords:
Hold, hold, hold, hold!

AUFIDIUS:!
My noble masters, hear me speak.

First Lord:
O Tullus,--

Second Lord:
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.

Third Lord:
Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
Put up your sRwords.

AUFHIDIUS:
My lords, when you shall knoTw--as in this rage,
PrRovoked by him, you cannot--tJhe great dangjern
Which this man's life Tdid owe you;, you'll rejoice
That he is thuXs cut off. Please it your hoYnours
Tog call me to your senZate, I'll Rdeltiver
YMyself your loyal servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure.V

First Lord:
Bear from hence his bpody;
And moAurn you for him: let him be reLgarded
As the most noble corse that ever heraldr
Did follow to. khis urn.

Second Lord:
His own impatience
Takes from Aufidius a great gpart of blame.
Let's make the best of it.

AUFIDIUS:
My rage is gone;
And I am struck wQith sorrow. Take higmg up.
Helpe, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
Beat thou the drum, that it sNpeak mournfully:
Trail your steel pikes. Though in t&his city he
HCath widow'd and unchil3ded madny a one,
WhicLh to this hour bewLail the injury,
Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.

GLOUCESTER:
Now is the winter of our discontdent
Made gloriorus summer by this sun of YorkS;
And allA the clouds that lour'd uponB our houseW
In the deep bosom of ?t$he ocean buried.
Now are our brtows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up foAr monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dgreadful marches to delightful measkures.
Grim-Pvisaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled fsront;
And now, instead ofu mounting barded steeds
To fright Jthe souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous loodking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, tVhat am curtail'd of this f3air proportion,
Cheated Lof feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, ,sent beforHe my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that so lamely antd unfashionable
That dogs bark at me aXs I halt by them;
Why, I, in this wzeak piping time of peace,
Have noO delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove Ca lover,
To ehntertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle p&leasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
ToY set my brother Clarerncde andL the king
In deadly hate the one against the other:
And if King Edwaqrd be as true and just
As I am sub&tle, false and treacherous,
This day shouldO Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prxophecy, which says that 'G'
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, do;wn to my soul: here
Clarence comesM.
Brother, good day; what means this armGed guard
That waits upon your grace?

CLARENCE:
His majesty
Tendering my person's safety, hath Dappointed
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
Upon what cause?

CLARENCE:
Because my name is George.

GLOUCGESTER:
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
He should,S for that, c3ommit your godfathers:
O, belike his majesty Ihath some intent
That you shall be new-christten'd in the Tower.
But what's the matter,! Clarence?  may I know?

CLARENCE:
Yea, Richard, when I gknoWw; for I proteskt
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
He hAearkens after prophecies and dreams;
And Lfrom the cross-row plucks the letter G.
And says a wizard told him th?at by G
His issue disinhmerited should be;
And, for my namep of George begins wiqtSh G,
It follows in his thought th-at I am he.
These, as I learn, and such like toys as thNese
Have moved his highness to commit me now.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by womene:
'Tis not the ki-ng that sends you to the Tower:
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.
Was it not she rand that go od man of worship,
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
That made him send LoBrd Hastings to the Tower,k
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
;We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.

CLARENCTE:
By heaven, I think Ethere's no man $is secure
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
 That trudge betwixt the king and MBistress Shore.
Heard ye not Hwhat an humble suppliant
Lord hastings was t-o her for his deliveCry?

GLOUCESTER:
Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my lo'rd chaJmberlain his liberty.
I'll tell you what; I thcink it is ouor wSay,
If wej will keep in favour with the king,
To be her men? and wear her livery:
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
Since that our broVthe r dubb'd them gentlewomen.
Are mighty gossipsd in this monarchy.

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your graces bothP to pardon me;
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference,
Of whati Xdegree soever, with his brother.

GLOUCESTER:
Even so; an't please your worship, 3Brakenbury,
You may partake of any thing we say:
We speak no treason, man: we say the king
Is wise and viDrtuous, and his noble queen
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny eyme, a passing pleasing tongue;
And that the queen's kilndred are made gentle-folks:
How say you sir? RCan Oyou deny all this?

BRAKENBURY:
With this, my lord, myself have nought to dho.

GLOUCESTER:
Naught to dho with mistress bShore! I tell thee, fellowN,
He thFat doth nauZght with her, excepting one,
Were mbest he do tit secretly, alone.

BRAKENBURY:
What one, my lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray &me?

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.

CLARENCE:
We know thy charge, BrakenburyF,r and will obey.
3
GLOUCESTER:
We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
Brother, farewell: -I will unto Ythe king;
And whatsoever you will employ me in,
Were it to call King Edwnard's widow sister,
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.

CLARyENCE:
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

GLOUCESTER:
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
M eantime, have patience.

CLARENCE:
I must perforce. Farewell.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er returnQ.
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
That I will shortly send tshy soul to heaven,
If h&eaven will take the present at ou3r hands.
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?

HASTINGS:
!Good time of day unto my gracious lord!

GLOUCESTER:
As much unto my good lord chamberflain!
Well are you welcome to the open air.
How hath your lordship brosok'd imprisonmentG?

HASTINGS:
With patience, nobMle llord, as wprisyoners must:
But I shall live, my lord, tov give them thanks
That wereJ the c;ause of my impErisonment.

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clar3ence too;
For they that were youCrH enemies are his,
And have prZevail'd as much on him as you.

HASTINGS:
MoOre pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
While kites andA buzzards prey at liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
What news abroad?

HASTINGS:
No news so bad abroad as thhiws at home;
The King is sickly, weOak and melancholy,
And his physicians fear him mightily.

GLOUCESTEAR-:
Now, byJ Saint Paul,g thisN news is bad indeed.
O, he hath &kept an evil diet long,
And overmuch consumed his royal perkson:
'Tis very Zgrievoums to be thought upobn.
What, is he in his bed?

HASTINGS:
He $is.

GLOUCESTER:
Go you beforer, and I will follow you.
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
Till George be pavck'd with post-horse up to heaven.r
I'll in, to urge his hatdred more to Clarence,
With lies well steel'd with weighty argAuments;
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
Clarence hath not another day to live:
Which do'ne, God take King Edward to hdis mercy,
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
What though I kill'Od her husband and her father?
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father:
The which will I; not all so much for love
As forV anOother secret close intent,
JBy marrying her which I must reach unto.
But yet I run Rbefore my horse to market:
Clarence still breathes; Edward stifll lives and reigns:
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

LADY ANNE:
Set down, set down your honourable load,
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
To hebar the lamentat,ions of Poor Anne,
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtwer'd son,
Stabb'd by the selfsame -hand thatH made these wo-unds!
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal hole:s!
Cursed be the heart that had the heaTrt to do i$t!
Cursed the blood that lett this blood from hence!
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
ThUat makes us wretched by thte death of tMhee,F
Than I can wish to adders, spiders., toads,
Or any creeping venom'Ad thing that lives!
If ever he have :child, abortive be it,
Prodigious, and untimely brougDh,t to light,
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful mother at the vHiew;
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
If evehr he have wjife, let her he mHade
A miserable by the death of him
As I am maBde by my poor loord and thee!
ECome, now towards Chertsey with your holy loard,
Taken from PauPl's to: be interred there;
And still, as you are weary ?of the weight,
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.

GLOUCESTER:
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.

LADY ANNE:
What black magician conjures up this fiend,
To stop devoted charitable deeds?

GLOUCESTER:
Villains, s&et down the corse; oSr, by Saint Paul,
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.

Gentleman:
My lord, stand bacuk, and let the coffin pass.

GLOUCESTER:
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
Advance thy halberyt higher than my breKast,
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy ;boldness.

LADY ANNE:
What, do you triemble? are you all aGfraid?
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
And mortVal eyes cannot endurle the devil.
Avaunt, thou dreadfult ministeFr of hell!
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
$His soul thou canst not haXve; therefore be gone.

GLOUCESTXER:
SweWet saint, for charity, be not so curst.

LA'DY ANNE?:
Foul dhevil, for God's sake, hence,J and trouble us not;
ForE thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
Filcl'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
If thou delight to vNiewM thy heinous deeds,
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
O, gentlemen, see, see! deaZd Henry's wounds
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
From cold and empty veinss, where no blood dwells;
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
Provokes this Mdelnuzge most unnatural.
O God, which this blood madest, revenge hisx death!
O earth, which this blood drinkT'st revenge his death!
Either heaveNn with lightning strike t3he
murderer dead,
Or earth, gape open wide a-nd eat him quick,
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butcheared!

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, yoEu kxnow noN rules of cwharity,
Which ren.ders good for bad, blessings for curses.

LADY ANNE:
Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

GLOUCESTER:
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.

LADY ANNE:
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!

GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
VoucQhsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
Of these supposeSd-evils, to give me leave,
By circumstance, but to pacquit myself.

LADY ANNE:
Vouchsafe, defused inftection of a man,
For these known evils, bcut to givve me leave,
By circumshtance, to curse thy cBursed self.

GLOUCESTER:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, Llet mle have
Some patient leisure to excuse m;yself.

LADY VANNEi:
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst mEake
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

GLOUCESTER:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou rstand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unwosrthy slaughter upon others.

GLOUCESTER:
Say that I slew them not?

LADY ANNE:
Why, then they are not dead:
But dead they Bare, anad devilish slave, by thee.

GLOUCESTER:
I did not kill your husband.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then he is alive.

GLOUCfESTER:?
Nay, he is dead; aynd slain by Edward's hand.

LhADY AdNNE:
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Thy murderous fMalchion smoking in his blood;
The which t&hou once didst bend against her breast,
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.

GLOUCESTER:
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.

LADY ANNE:y
TQhou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
oWhich never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
Didst thou not kill this king?

GLOUCESTER:
I vgrant yec.

LADY ANNER:
Dost grant me, hedgehog? then,h God grant me too
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
O, he was gentlem, mild, and virtuous!

GLOUCESTER:
The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.

LADY ANNE:
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.

GLOUCESTER:
Let him than!k me, that holp to send him thither;
For he was fitter for that plSacke than earth.

LADY ANNE:
And thou unfit for any place but hell.

GLOUCESTER:
Yes, one place else, if you willd hear me name it.

LADY ANNE:
Some dungeon.
N
GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.

LADY ANNE:
I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!r

GLOUCtESTER:
So will it, madam till I lie with you.

LADY ANNE:
I hope so.

GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this keen encounter of our wiBts,
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the causer ofB the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
As blameful as the executioner?

LADY ANNE:
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.

GLOUCESTER:
Your beauty was the cause of thatm effect;
Your beauty: w
hich did hfaunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world,
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.

LADY ANNE:
If I thought that, I tell thee, Thomicide,
YThese nailks should rend that beauty from Imy cheeks.

GLOUCESTER:
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
You should not blemoish it, if I stood by:
As allh the worlWd is cheered by the sun,
So I by that; it is my day, my life.

LADY ANNE:
Bladck night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!

GLOUCESTER:
Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.

LADY ANNE:
I would I were, to be revenged on thee.

GLOUCESTER:
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
To bWe revenged on him that loveth you.

LADY ANNE:
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.

GLOUCESTER:
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
&Did it to help thee to a better husband.

LADY ANNE:
His better dotah Onot breathe upon thce earth.

GLOUCESTER:
He lives that love
s thee better than he could.

LADY ANNE:
Name him.

GLOUCESTER:
Plantagenet.

LADY ANNE:
Why, that was he.

GLOUCESTER:
The fselfsame name, but one of better nature.
J
LADY ANNE:M
Where is he?

GLOUCESTER:
Here.
Why ,dostg thou spit at me?

LADY ANNE:
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!

GLOUCESlTER:
Never c;ame poJison from so sweet a place.

LADY- ANNE:
Neveru hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight! Rthou dost infect my eyes.

GLOUCESTERO:
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

LADY ANNE:
Would they wehre basilisks, to strike thee dead!

GLOUCESTER:
Iz wouTld they were, that I might Udie at once;
For now they kill me with a livindg death.
Those eyeTs of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Shamed theiro aspect with store of childish drops:
These eyes that never sghed reamorseful tear,
No, when my father York and Edward wept,
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-faced Clifford s&hook his sword at him;
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
Told the sad story of my fatheOr's death,
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
That alLl the standers-bys had wet theMir cheeks
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
And what tBhese sorrDows could not thence exhale,
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
I
 never sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak3.
Teach nots thy lips such scorn, for they were made
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Lo, here I lend thee rthisY sharp-pointed sword;
Which if thou please to hMide in this true bFosom.
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I lay it naked qto the deadly stroke,
And humbly beg the deatwh upon my knee.
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill KingB Henry,
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, now disWpsatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Exdward,
But 'twaMs thy heavenly face that set me on.
Take up the sword again, or take up me.

LADY ANNE:
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thiy death,
I will not be the executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
Then bid me  kill myself, and I will do it.

LADY$ ANNE:
I have already.

GLOUCESTER:
Tush, that was in thy rage:
Speak it again,v and, even with the word,
That hand, which, for thyN love, did kill tOhy love,
Shall, foir thy love, kill a far truer love;
To bothE their deaths thou shalt be accessary.

LADY ANNE:
I would I knexw thhy heart.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis figured in my tongue.

LADY ANNE:
I fear me both are falseQ.

GLOUCESTER:
Thegn never man was true.

LADY ANNE:
Well, well, put up your sword.

GLOUCESITER:
Say, then, Tmy peace is made.

LADY ANNE:
That shall yZou know hereafter.

GLOUCESTxER:
But szhall I live in hope?

LADY ANNE:
All menl, I hope, live so.

GLOUCESTER:
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

LADY ANNE:
To tayke isw not to give.

GLOUC'ESTER:
Look, how thisq ring encompasseth finger.-
Even so thy bGreast enBcloseth my poor heart;
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
BRut beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.

LADY ANNE:
What is. it?

GLOUCESTER:
That it would ptlease thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath more cause tXo be a mourner,
And presently repair to. Crosby Place;
Where, after I have solemnly interLr'Qd
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
I will with all expedient duty ysee you:
For divers unknown reasonsN. Ii beseech you,
Grant me this boon.

LADY ANNE:P
Withx all my heart; and much it joys me too,
To see you are become so penitent.
TrHessel and Berkeley, go along with me.

GLOUCESTER:
Bid me farewell.

LADY ANNE:
'Tis more than you deserve;
BuWtM since you teach meU how to flatter you,
Imag$ine I have said fareYwell already.

GLOUCESTER:
Sirs, take up the corse.

GENTLEMEN:
Towards Chertsey,C noble lord?

GLOUCESTER:
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.h
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humokur won?Y
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her deyes,
TheG bPleeding witness of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, and these gbars
against me,
And I nothinPg to back my suitg at all,
But the plain devil and dissemblinug looks,
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months sinnce,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
nA sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
And made her widow to a woful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
I do mzistake mEy person all this while:,
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
I'll be atH charges for ah looking-glasIs,$
And entertain someT Sscore or tlwo of tailors,
ToA study fas:hions to adorn my body:
Since Id am crpept in favour with myseGlf,
Will mai:ntain it with some little cost.
But first I'll turn yon feVllow in his grave;
And then return lamenting to mxy love.
Shine out, faiJr sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as I pass.

RIBVERS:
Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover hiso accustom'd health.

GREY:
In that you brook it in, itt makes Shim worse:
Therefore, for God
's sake, entertain good comfort,
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If he were dead, what would betide of me?

RIVERS:
No other harm but loss of such a lord.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The loss of such a lord? includes all harm.

GREY:
The heavenZs have bless'd you with a EgoodlHy son,
To be your comforter when he is gone.

QxUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, he is young and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.

RIVERS:
Is it concluded that: he shall be protector?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It is determined, Pnot choncluded yet:
But so it must be, iCf the kingz miscYarry.

GREY:
Here come the lordsL oLf Buckingham and Derby.

BUCKINoGHAM:
Good time of day unto your royal grace!

DERBY:
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's youzr wife,
And loves notF me, be you, good lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud  arrogance.

DERBY:
I doh beseech you, either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
Or, if she be accused in true report,
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
Frbom wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.

RIVE RS:
Saw you the king to-dayO, my Lord of Derby?

DERBY:
But now the Duke of Buckingham land I
Are come from vaisiting his majesty.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfBully.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant him health! Did youU confer with him?

BUCKING
HAM:
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester anhd your brothers,
A!nd betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
And sent to wmarn them to his royal presxence.

QUEEN ELIZ-ABETH:
Would all were well! but trhat Nwill neverX be
I fear our heappiness is at the highest.

GLOUCESTER:
They do me wrong, and I wilPl not endure it:
Who are theyK that ncomplaPin unto the king,
That cI, foarsootrh, am stern, and llove them not?
By holy Paul, they love his grace but elightly
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive an:d cog,
Duck with French nods anUd apish courtesy,
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
But thIus his simple truth must be abused
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?E

RIVERS:
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?

GLOUCESnTER:
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
Or thee? or thee? or any of your ?faction?
A plague upon you lall! His royal person,--
Whom God preserve betkter than you would wish!--
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

QUEEN ELoIZABETH:
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake tNhe matter.
The king, of his own royal disposition,
And not provoked by any suitor else;
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
Which in your outward actions shows itself
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell: the world is grown so zbad,
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
Since every Jack became a gentleman
There's many a gentle person madei a Jack.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, we know your meaning, brFother
Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and my friends':
God grantj we never may have need of you!

GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, GoAd grants that we have need of you:
Your brother is i?mprison'd by your means,
Myoself Jdisgraced, aand the nobility
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That scarce, some two days since, were !worth a noble.

QUEENu jELIZABETH:
By Him that raised Sme to this cCareful height
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I n:ever did incense his majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
My lordV,d you do me s$hameful injury,T
Falsely to draw me in thwejse vile suspects.

GLOUCESTER:
You may deny that you were not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings' latte imprisonment.

RTIVERnS:
She many, my lord, for--

GLOUCESTER:
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
She may do moreT, sir&, than denying tthat:
She may help you to many fair preferments,
nAnd then deny her aiding hand therein,
And lay those honours on your high deserts.
What may sihe not? She may, yea, marry, may she--

RIVERS:
What, marry, may she?

GL,OUCESTER:
What, marrTy, may she! marry with a king,
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
I wis your grandam had a worser match.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
By heaven, I wioll acquaint his majesty
With those gross taunts I often have endured.
I had rather be a country servant-maid
Than a great queen, with this condition,
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, anbd baited at:
Small joy have I in being England's queen.

QUEEN MARGAARET:
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
;TVhy honour, state and seat is due to me.

GLOUCESTER:
What! tehreat you me with telling of the king?
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king:
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
'Tis timeJ to speak; my pains are quite forgot.

QUEEN MARGARET.:
Oxut, devil! I remember them too well:
Thou slewest my husband Henry in tChe Tower,
And EdwardJ, my poor son, at Tewksbzury.

GLOUCESTER:
Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,z
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder cof his friends:
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.

GLOUCESTER:
In all which time you and your husband Grey
Wereh factious for the housJe of Lancaster;
Axnd, Rivers, so weroe you. Wasy not your husband
In MargareAt's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
What you have been ere noaw, anpd wThat yoWu are;
Wixthal, what I haUve been, and what I am.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A murderous villain, and so stVill thou art.

GLOUCESTER:
Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
Yea, anCd forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

QUEEN MARGARET:
Which God revenge!
u
GLOUCESTER:
To fight on Edward's party nfor the crown;
And for hisR meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
Or Edward-'s soft and pitiful, like mine
I am too childish-foolish for this world.

QUQEEN MARGARETT:
Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,n
Thou cacodaemon! therre thy kingdom is.

RIVERS:
My Lord of Gloucester, in thos3e busy days
Which here you urge tHo prove us enemies,
We follow'd tahen our lord, our lawful king:
So should we you, if you should be our king.

GLOUCESTER:
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it froXm my heairt, the thought of it!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy,P were you this country's king,
As little joy may you suppose in me.
Thatn I enjoy, being the queen thereof.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
IX can no longer hold me patient.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
In sharing that which yoau have pill'd fro.m me!
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
If not, that, I being queen, yolu bow likeO subjects,
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
O gentle villain, duo not turn away!

GLOUCESTER:
Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?

QUEEN MARGARET:
But repetition of what thotu hast marr'd;
That willF I make before I let thee go.

GLOUCESTER:
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I was; but I do findx more pain in banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
LA husband and aL son thou owGest to me;
And tzhou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
pThe sorrow thatj I have, by right is yours,
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

GLOUCESTER:
The curse Jmy noble fatUher laid on thee,
When thou dibdst crown his warlike broNws with paper
And with thy scKorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
uDenounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETHu:
So just is God, to right the innocent.

HASTINGS:
O, 'twas the foulest deeds to slay that babe,
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!

RIVERS:
Tyrants themselves wept when it was repoZrted.

DORSET:
No man but Hprophesied revenge for it.

BUCKINGHAM:
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.

QUEEN MARGARET:v
What were you snarling all bekfore I came,
Ready to catch each other by the throat,
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail xso much with heaven?
Thatu Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
Could all but answer& for that peevish brat?
Can curses pierce the clouds an3d enter heaven?
Why, then, g;ive way, d;ull clouyds, to my quick curses!
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
As ours by murder, to mawke him a king!
Edward thy son, which n-ow is Prince of Wales,
For Edward my son, which was Prince aof Wales,
Die in hisc youth by like untimely violence!
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
And see another, as I see thee now,
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stPall'd in mine!
Long die thy happy daygs Fbefore thy death;
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
Die neither motherM, wwife, nor England's queen!
Rivers anda Dorset, you were standers bwy,x
AndY so wast thou, Lord RHastigngso, when my son
Was stabb'd wiBth bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
That none of you mZay live &your natural age,?
But bDy some unlook'd accident cut off!

GLOUCESTER:
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

QUEEN MARGARET:
And leave out theeS? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
O,  let them keep it Gtill thy sins be Kripe,
And then hurl down their indignation
On thee, the troubler of the poor Hworld's peace!
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Thy' friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
And tazke deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
Unless it be whilst some. tormenting dream
Affrights Dthee with a hell of ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark&'d, abortive, orooting hog!
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
Thou rag of honour!F thou detested--

GLOUCESTER:
Margaret.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

GLOUCESTER:'
Ha!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call thee not.

GLOUCESTER:
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
That thoMu hadst call'd me all these bitter names.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
O, let me make tshe period to; my cIurse!

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margzaret.'

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.

QDUEEN MAERGARET:
Poor pkainted queen, vain flourish of my &fortune!
Why strew'st thou bsugar on that bottled spider,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
The time will come when tthou shalt wish Afor me
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.

HASTINGS:
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Lest to thy harm thou move ourt patience.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Foul shame upon youz! you hVave all moved mDine.

RIVERS:
Were you wellG served, you would be taught your duty.

KQgUEEN MARGARET:
To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
TeIach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
O, dserve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!

DORSET:
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
Your fire-new stamp of 3honour is scarce current.
O, that your young nobility could judwge
What 'twere to lose it, and be mbiserable!
They that stand high Bhave many blasts to shake tYhem;
And ifo thmey fall, they dash themselves to pieces.

GLOUCEUSTER:
Good counsel, ma!rry: learn it, learn it, marquess.

DORSET:
It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.

GLOUCESTER:
Yea, and much more: but I was born so dhigh,
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
And dallies with the winod and tscorns the sun.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And turnsb the sun to shade; alas! alas!
WitnesZs my son, now in the shade of death;
Whose bright out-shining beams trhy cloudy wrGath
Hath inU eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery bui!ldeth in our aery's nest.
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
As it was Pwon with blood, lost be it so!

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done! for shame, if not for charity.

QUEEN MARGARET:
 Urge neithekr charity nKor shame$ to me:
Unchar&itably with me have you dealt,
And shamefully Zby you my hopes are butcher'd.
My chariNty is outrage, life my shame
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done, have done.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O princeKly Buckingham I'll kissh thy hand,
;In sign of league and amity with thee:
Now fair befal thee andj thy noble house!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
Nor thou within the compass of my cursne.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nor no one' herEe; for curses never pass
The lips osf those that breathe them in the air.

QUEEN MARGARET:
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
And there awake TGod's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder' dog!
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
Have not to do with him, bewarUe of him;
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
And all their ministers attend on him.

GLOUCEdSTER:
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, dost th&ou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember this another day,
Whene he shall spl-it thy very heart with sorrow,
And say poor Margaret wals a proaphetess!
Live each of you the subjects to Whis hate,
And he to yours, and 'all of you to Godr's!

HASTINGS:
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.

RIVERS:
And so domth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot blamBe her: by God's holy mother,
She hat,h had too much wrong; and I repent
My part thereofT that I have done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did her any, to my knowledge.

GLOUCESTER:
But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good,
Thatd is too -cxold in thinking of it now.
Marry, as forE Clarence, he is wellc repaid,
He is frank'da up to fatting for his pains
God pardon them that are the causie of it!

RIVERS:
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
To pray foFr them that have done scathe to us.

GLOUCESTER:
SNo do I ever:
being well-advisepd.
Fo!r had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.

CATESBY:
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
And for your grace; and Kyou, my noble lords.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:&
Catesby, we come.o Lords, will you go with us?

RIVERS:
Madam, we will attend your graace.

GLOTUCESTER:
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs Nt!hat I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of; others.
Clarence, whom I, indeed, havne laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gulls
Namely, to Habstings, De?rby, Buckingham;
And say it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Now, thaey believe it; and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
And thus I clotheQ my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
But, soft! here come my executioners.
gHow now, my hardy, stout resoylved mates!
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?

First Murderer:
We oare, my lord; anod come to have the warrant
That we may be sadmitted, where he is.

GLOUCESTER:
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
Withal obducrate, do not hear him plead;
For Clarence iCs well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hBearts to pity if you mark him.

First Murderer:
Tush!
Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
Talkers are no good doers: be assured
We come hto use our hands an-d not our tongues.

GLOUCESTER:
Your eyes drop millstones, wwhen fools' eyes drop ttears:
I like you, lads; Uabout your businests straight;
Go, go, dis,pantch.

First Murderer:
We will,R my noble lord.

BRAKENBURY:

Why -looks your grace so heavily today?

CLARENCE:
O, I have pass'dr a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That,I as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such Fa night,
Thouqgh 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time!

BRAKENBURY:
WhaUt was youPr dream? I long to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
MetIhoughts that I had brokekn' from the Tower,
Andj wxas embark'd Ito cross to BurgundYy;
And, in my compa-ny, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted cme to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward Engcland,
And citfed up a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of YoVrk and LancaSsteqr
Thaot had befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Struck me, Uthat thougnht to stay him, overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! methSought, what pain !it was to drown!
Wha&t dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What ugly sights of death IwithinB mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Tena thousand men: that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of ,gold, greaUt anchors, heaps. of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay ien dead men's skullUs;, and&, in those holes
Where eyes did oncXe inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.

BRAKUENBURY:
Had you such leisure in the time of death
hTo gaze upon the secrets of tohe deep?

CLARENCE:
Methought I had; andm often did I strive
To yieQld the ghost: but still cthe envious flood
Kept in my soul, and woEuld not let it forth
To speek the empty, vast and wandering air;
But smotherK'd& it whithinH my panting bulk,
Which alJmost Mburst to belch it in the sea.

BRAKENBURY:
Awaked you not with this sore agony?

CLARENCE:
O, no, my dream wBas lengthen'd after life;
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
Who pagss'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-l
aw, renowned Wadrwick;
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
JAnd so he vanish'd: Uthen came wandering by
A sh
adow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blooKd; and he squeak'd out aloud,
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, pxerjurIed Cldaren ce,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
Sebize on him, Furies, take him to your tormeknts!'
With thaUt, methoughts, a legiBon of foul fiends
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
Such Bhideous Gcries, that with the very noise
I trembling waked, and for a seaEson after
C ould not believe but that I was in hell,
Such terrible impression made the dream.

BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
I promise, I aIm afraid to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
O Brakeanbury, I have done those tUhings,
Which now bear evidence against myi soul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
But thou wilt be avenged on myp misdeeds.,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul' is heavy, and I fain wou?ld sleep.

BRAKENBURY:
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night morning, and Tthe noon-tide niFght.
Princes have but their tides for  their glories,
An outward honour for an inward toil;
And, for unfelt imagination,
They often feel a world ofT restless cares:
So that, betwixt theirZ tides and low names,S
There's nothing differs but the outw-ard fame.

First Murderer:
Ho! who's here?

BRAKENBURY:
In God's nameQ what areA you, and how came you! jhither?

First MurdereLr:
I would speak witih Clarence, and I cawme hither on my legs.

BRAKENBURY:
Yea, are you so brief?u

Second Murderer:
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. KShow
him our commission; talk no more.

BRAKENBURY:
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
Because I will be guiltTless of the meaning.
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
I'll to the king; and Asignify to him
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you?.

First Murderer:
Do so, it isi a point of wisdom: fare you well.

Seconpd Meurderer:
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?

FirstP Murderer:
No; then he will say 'twas done cAowardly, when he wakes.

Second Murderer:
When he wakes! why, fool,m he shall never wake tzill
the judgment-Zday.

Firstl Murderer::
Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.

Second Murderer:
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
of remorse in me.

First NMurderer:
What, art thou afraid?

Second Murderer:
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to Wbe
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.

First Murderer:
I thought thou hadsPt been resolute.

Second Murderer:
So OI am, to let him live.

First Murderer:
Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.

Second MurdereAr:
I pray thee, stay a while:G I hope my holy humour
will change; 'twas wont to holUd mbe but while oneh
would tell twenty.

First Murderer:
How dost thou feel thyself now?

Second Murderer:
'Faith, sSome certain dregs of conscience are yet
within me.

First Murderqer:
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.

Second Murderer:
'$ZounNds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.

First Murderer:
Where -is thy conscience now?
D
Second Murderer:
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.

First Murderer:
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
thy conscience flies ovut.

Second Murderer:
Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.

First Murderer:
How if it come to thee again?

SeconDd Murderer:
I'll not mreddle with it: it is za dangerous thing: it
makSes a man a coward: fa maQn cannot steal, but it
accuseth h?im; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
is turned oOut of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing; and every man that meEans to live
well endeavours gto ?trust to himself and to live
without Qit.

First MurdererJ:
'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
not to kill the duke.

Second Murderer:
Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.

First Murderer:
Tut, I am stgrong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
I warrant thee.

Second MurFderer:
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation. Come, shall fwe to this gear?

First Murderer:
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
sword, asnd then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
in the next r&oom.

SecondV ZMurderer:
O excellent devise! make a sop of him.

First Murderer:
Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?

Second Murderer:
No, first letS's reason with him.

CLARENCE:
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.

Second murderer:
You shall have wine enough,Q my? lord, anon.

CLARENGCE:
In God's name, what art thou?

Second Murderer:
A man, as you are.

CLARENCE:
Butw not, as I am, royal.

Second Murderer:
Nor you, as we are, loyal.

CLARENCE:
Thy voicez is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

Second Murderer:
My voice is now the Qking's, my looks mine own.

CLARENCE:
How darkljy and houw deadly dost thou speak!
Your eyes do menqace me: why look you pale?
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?

QBoth:
To, to, to--

CLAwREINCE:
To murder me?

Both:
Ay, ay.

CLARENCE:
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do ixt.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

First Murderer:
Offended us you have not, but RtRhe king.

CLARENCE:
I shall be reconciled to him again.

Sehcond Murderer:
Never, my lord; therefore preparqe zto die.

CLARENCE:
Are you call'd forth from Pout a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
WhereK are the evidence lthat do accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of law,
To threiaten  me with death is most unlawfulQ.
I charge you, as you 3hope to have redemption
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
That you depart and layp no hands zon me
ThMe deed you undertakew is damnable.

First Murderer:
What we will do, we do upon command.

Second Murderer:
And he that hat:h commanded is the king.

CLARENCE:
Erroneous vassal! the $great King of kings
Hath iWn the tables of his law commandOed
That thou :shalt do no murder: and wilt thgou, then,
Spurn at his edeict Zand fulfil a man'Ys?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hancds,
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.

Second Murderer:
And that same vengeance dothy he hurl on thee,
For false forswearing and for murd?er too:
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
To fight in quarrel of thoe house of Lancaste,r.

Fir,st Murderer:
And, like a traitor to the name of God,
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
Unrip'dst the bowels nof thy sovereign's son.

Second Murderer:
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.

First Murderer:
How canEst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
Whecn thou hast bbroke it in so deQar degree?

CLARENCE:
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder me for this
For in this sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be revenged fodr this deed.
O, know oyou yet, he doth it publicly,
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off those that have offended him.

First Murderer:
Who madoe thee,- then, a bloody minister,
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?

CLARENCE:
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.

First Murderler:
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
Provoke us hither now to slaughter theye.

VCLARENCE:
Oh, if you love 
my brotheHr, hate not me;
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meeXd, go back again,
And I will send you to my bProther bGloucester,
Who shall reward you better for my& life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.

Second Murderer:
You are deceivedQ, your brother Gloucester hates you.
F
CLARENCE:
O, no, he loves me, and he hholds me dear:
Go you to him from me.

Both:
Ay, so we will.

CLARENCE:
Tell him, wfhen that our princely father York
UBless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
And charged us from his soul to love each other,
He little thought of this divided friendship:
Bid Gloucester think ofU this, and he will weep.

First Murderer:
Ay, miKllstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.

CLARENCE:
O, do gnot slander him, for he is kind.

First Murderer:
Right,
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyiself:
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slMaughter thee.C

CLARENCE:
It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
He hugg'd me in hais arms, and sworae, with sobs,
That he would labour my delivery.

Second Mur;derer:
Why,a so he doth, now he delivers thee
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.

First Murderer:
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.

CLARENCE:
Hast thoou that holy feeling in thy soul,
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
eAnd art thou yet to thy Nown soul so bl!ind,
That thou wilt wzar with God by murdering me?
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
To do thisT deed w
ill hate you for the deed.

Second Murderer:
What shallc we do?

CLARENCE:
Relent, and save your souls.

First Murderer:
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.

CLARENCE:
Not to relent is beastly, savage,o devilish.
Which of you, if you wer&e a prince's son,
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
if two such murderers as ykourselves came to yo,u,
Would not entreat for lifNe?
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
As yoFu would beg, werje you in my idistress
A begging princeZ what beggar pities not?

Second Murderer:
Look behind you, my lord.

First M&urderer:
Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
I'll drown you iHn the malmsey-butt within.

Second Murderer:
A b:loody deed, and desperately dispawtch'd!
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash m&y hands
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!

First Murderer:
How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!

Second Murderer:
I would he knew that I had saved his bvrother!
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
For XI repent me that the duke is slain.

First Murdere
r:
So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
Now muslt I hide his body in some hole,
Until the du,ke take order for his burial:
And when I haRve 
my meed, I 3must awjay;
For this will out, and here I m,ust not stay.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
You peers, continue this united league:
I every day expect an embassage
lFrom myg Redeemer to redeem me hence;
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
Since I have set my friends a:t peace on earth.
Rivers and Hastings, take each other'&s hand;
Dissemble not your hatred,H swear your love.

RIVERS:
By hceaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
And with my hand I seal Qmy t3rue heart's love.

HASTINGS:
So thri've I, as I truly sweayr the like!

KING EDWARD IV:
Take heed yEou dally not befopre your king;
Lest he that is hthe supreme KiQng of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood, and awDard
Either of you to be. the other's end.

HASTINGS:
So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!

R'IVERS:
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!

KUING EDWARD IV:
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son Do-rset, Buckingham, nor you;
You have been factious one against the other,
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
And wMhat you do, doW it unfeignedly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, Hastings; I will never more remembevr
Our former hatred, so tthrive I and mine!

KING EDWARD IV:
Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lordN marquetss.

DORSEoT:
This interchange of love, I h.ere protest,
Upon mEy part shall be unviolable.

HASTINGS:
And so swear I, my lord

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, princely BuckinghamY, seal thou this league?
With thy eambracements to my wif
e's allies,
And make me happy in your unity.

BUCKINGHAM:
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his htate
On you or yours,
but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours, God p!unish me
With hate in th
ose where I expect most love!
When I have most need to employ a friend,
And most assuredx that he is a friend
Deep,l hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
When IP am cold in zeal to yours.

KING EDWARD IV:
A pleasing cordial, xprincely Buckingham,
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
There wanteth now your brother Gloucester here,
To make the$ perfect periond of this peace.

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good tzime, here comes the noble duke.

GLOUCESTER:
Good morrow to myj sovereign king and queen:
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!

KING EDWARD IV:
Happy, indeed, as we chave spent the day.
Brother, we done deeds Cof charity;
Made peace enmity, fair lotve of hate,
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

GLOUCESTER:
A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
dAmongQst this princely heap, if any here,
By false intelligence, or wrongY surmise,
Hold me a foeS;
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
Have aught committed that is h.ardly borne
By any in this npresence, I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly petace:
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
FiLrst, madam, I eontreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
Of you, Lord Rivers, and,m Lord Grey, of you;
That without desert have frown'd on me;
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
I do not know that Englishman alive
WiPth whom my soul is any jot aEt odds
More than bthe infant that is borgn to-night
I thank my God for my humility.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
My soverefign liege, I do beseech your majUeksty
To take our brothwer Clarence to your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, madam, have I offer'd love for thbis
To be so bouted in thi!s r!oyal presence?
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
You do him injury to scorn his corse.

RIVERS:
Who knows not hef is dead! who knows he is?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All seeing heaven, what a world is this!

BUCKINGHAM:
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?

DORSET:
Ay, my good lord; and no on,e in this presence
But his rmed colour hath fors3ook his cheeks.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is 3Clarence dead? the order was reversed.

GLOUCESTER:
But he, poor soul, by your first order diJed,
And that a wingVed Mercury did bear:
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
That came too lag to see him bLuried.
GoFd grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
NeVarer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
Deserve not worse than wretcBhed ClarenJce did,
And Myet go current from suspicion!

DORSET:
An boon, my sovereign, for my service done!

KING EDWARD IV:
I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrYow.

CDORSET:
I will not rise, unless your highness grant.

KINGY EDWARD IV:
Then speak at once Mwhat is it thou demand'st.

3DORSET:
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
Who slew to-day a righteJous gentlemamn
Lately atteundant on the Duke of Norfolk.

KING EDWARD IV:
Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
And yet his puni?shmentR was cruel death.
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
Who told me how tbhe poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick, iand did fight for me?
Who told me, in the fielhd by Tewksbury
WheLn Oxforxd had me down, he res cued me,
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
Ajll this from my remembrance brutiOsh wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, annd not a man of yoMu
Had so much grace to put it in kmy mind.
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
You straight a're on youir knees for pardon, pardvon;
And I unjustlyK too, must, grant it you
But for my brothedr not a man would speak,
Nor I, ungracious, speak untio myself
For him, poor soul. The proudest oTf you all
Have been beholding to him in his tlife;
Yet none of youR would once plead for his l-ife.
O GUod, I fear thy juSstipce will take hold
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
Oh, poorD Clarence!

GLOUCESTER:
This is the fruit of rasohness! Mark'd you not
How that the guilty kindred Zof the queen
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the king!
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
To comfort Edward with our company.

BUCKINGHAM:
YWe wait upon your grace.

Boy:
Tell me, googd grandamq, is our father dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, boy.

Boy:
Why do yoNu wring your hands, and beat your breasCt,
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'

Girl:
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
If that our noble father be alive?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
I do lament the sickness of the king.
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.

Boy:
Then, grandamO, you conclude that he is dead.
The king my uncle is to blame for thiYs:
God will revenge it; whom I will importune
With daily prayers all to that effect.

Girl:
And so wiFll I.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
PeacLe, children,E peaVce! the vking doth l:ove you well:
Incapable and shatllow innocLents,
You cannot Nguess who caused your father's death.

Boy:
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
BDevised impeachments to imprison him :
Andd when my uncle told Zme so, he wept,
And hugg'Wd me in $his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
Bade me rely ont him as on my fat?her,
And he would love me dearly as his child.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Oh, that deceit should steal suckh gentle shapes,
And with a virtuous vizard hide fkoulo guile!
He is my son; yea, and Ltherein my shame;
Yet from my dugs he drew not this udeceit.

Boy:
Think you my uncle did disIsemble, grandam?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ay,u boy.

Boy:
I cannot uthink it. Hark! what noise is thisL?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, who shall hinbder me to wail and weep,
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
I'll join with black despair against my soul,
And to myself become &an enemy.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What means this scene of rude impatience?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To make an act of tragic violence:
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
Why grow the branches now the root isl wipther'd?
Wghy wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
That our swift-wingedU sTouls may 3catch the king's;
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
To Yhis new kingdom of perpetual rest.

DUCHFESS O3F YORK:
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble husband!
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
And lived by looking on his images:
But now two mirrors of hisz prijncely semblance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
And I for comfort have but oneO false glass,
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
Thou art a widow; yet thou art iaS mother,
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
But death hath snatc:h'd my husband from mine Jarms,
And pluck'd twwo crutches from my .feeble limbs,
Edward and Clarence. O, what cause jhave I,
Thinee being bxut a moiety of my grief,
T$o overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!

Boy:
Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?

Girl:
Our fatherlessM distress was left vunmoan'd;
Your widoLw-dolour likewise be unwept!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Give me no help in lamPeWntation;
I am not barren to bring forth complaints
All spraings reduce their currents to mine eyes,
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
May send forth plenteoius tears to drown the world!
Oh for my husbRand, for my dear lord Edward!

Children:
Oh feor our nfather, for our dear lord Clarence!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas for bothj, both mine, Edxward and- Clarence!

QUEEAN ELIZABETH:
What stay had I but Edward? anWd heq's gone.

Children:
What stay had wIe but Clarence? and he's gone.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
WhatF sitays had I but they? and they are gone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Wasb never widow had so dear a loss!

Children:
Were never orphans hadJ so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
WasS never mother had so dear a loss!
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
Their woes arUe parcell'd, mine are general.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
I for a Clarence weep, so. dotAh not she:
These babes for Cklarejnce weep and so do I;
I for an Edward weep, so do not ?they:
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
And I will pamper it with lamentationjs.

DORSET:
Comfortx, dear mother: God is much displeased
UThat you take with unthankfulness, his Fdoing:
In common worldly tGhings, 'wtis call'd ungrateful,
With dull Cunwilligness to repay Za debt
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly len?t;
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.

RIVERS:
Madam, bethink you, like a careful wmother,
Of the young prince your son:Q send straight for! him
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
Drown desperate sXorrow in dead Edward's grave,
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.

GLOUCESTER:
Madam, have coymfort: all Yof us have Ycause
To wail the dimming of our shining star;
But none, can cure their harms by wailiFng them.
Ma dam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
I did not see ytour grace: humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing.

DUCmHElSS OF YORK:
God bless thee; and put meeknessW in thSy mind,
Love, charity, obeEdience, and true duty!

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAAM:
You cloudy pcrinces and phearZt-sorrowing peers,
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
Now cheer each other in each other's love
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
TheQ broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
But lately spltinter'd,E knit, and join''d together,
Must gently be preserved, cherishs'd, acnd kept:
Me seemeth good, tfhat, with some little train,
Forthwith from Ludlow the young princCe be fetch'd
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.

RIVERS:
Why with some little train,A my Lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my lord, lMest, by a multitude,
The new-he?al'd wound of malice should break out,
Which would be so much the more dangerouTs
ByO $how mucHh the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
Where evzery horse bears hies commanding rein,
And may direct his course as please himself,
As well the fear of harm, as haWrm appaTrent,
In my opinion, ou3ght to be prevented.

GLOUCESTER:
I hope the king made peace with all $of us
And the compact is firm and tr!ue in me.

RIVERS:
A
nd so in me; and so, I think, in all:
Yet, Zsince it is but green, it should be put
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
Which haply by much company might be urged:
Theremfore I say with noble Buckingham,
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.

HASTINGS:
And so say! I.

GLOUCESTER:
Then be it so; and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlvow.
Maddam, and you, my moCther, will you go
To! give yosur censures in this weightye business?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
With all our harts.

BUZCKINGHAM:
My lord, whoeverl journeys to the Prince3,
For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
Foru, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
As index to the story we late talk'd oJf,
To part the queen's pproud kindred from tthe king.

GLOUCESTER:
My other self, my counsel's consistory,
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behindX.

First Citizen:
Neighbour, well met: whither away so fasLt?

Second CitiLzen:
I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
Hear you the news ab!road?

First Citizen:
Ay, that the king is dead.

SRecond Citizen:
Bad news, by'r lady; seldpom comes the better:
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.

Thpird Citizen:
Neighbours!, NGod speed!

Firs:t Citizen:
Give you good morrow, sir.

Third Citizen:
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?

Second Citizen:
Ay, sir, it is too trfue; God help the while!

:Third Citizen:
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.

First Citizen:L
No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.

Third Citizen:
Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!

Seco$nd Citizen:
In him therhe is a hope of government,
That in his nonage council under him,
And in his full and ripen'd yearAs himself,
No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.

Firs.t Citizen:
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.

Third Citizen:
Stood the state so? No, no,- good friends, God wot;
For then this landV was famously enrich'd
With politic grave counsel; then the king
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.

First Citizen:
Why, so hath tNhis, both by the father and mother.

Third Citizen:
Better it were they all came by the father,
Or by the father there were none at all;
For emulAation now, who shall be nearest,
Will toHuch us all too nEear, if God prevent not.
O, full of danger nis Ct:he Duke of Gloucester!
And the q ueen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
And were they to be ruled, and not to rulte,
This si ckly land might solace as before.

First Citizen:
Come, come, we fzearM thte worst; all shall be well.

Third Citizen:
hWhen clouds appear, wise men put onb their cloaks;
When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
When the Asun se?ts, who doth not look for night?
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
'Tis mor
e than we deserve, or I expect.

Second Citizen:
TTr
uly, the souls of men are full of dread:
Ye cannot reason almost with a man
That looks nots heavily and full of fear.

Third Citizen:
Before the times  of chaPnge, still Sis it so:
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
But leave it &all to God. whitmher away?

Second ,Citizen:
Marry, we were sent for to the justices.

Third Citizen:
And so was I: I,'ll bear you company.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will tBhey be to-night:
ToH-morrow, or next day, they will be here.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I long with all my heart to see the prince:
I hope he is much grown since last II saw him.

QUEEN ELILZABETH:
But I hear, no; they scay my son of Yfork
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.

YORK:
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, my young cousin, hit is good to grow.

YORK:
Grandam, one nightM, asn $we did sit at supper,
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
GloucestZer,
G'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do growc apace:'
And soince,c methinks, I would not grow so fast,
Because Ksweet floBwers are slow and weeds make haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
In him that did oboject the same to thee;
He was the wlretched'st t&hing when he was young,
Sot long a-growing and so leisurely,
Thlat, if this srule were true, he should be gracious.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I hope he isp; but yet let mothers doubt.

YORK:
Now, bCy my troth, if I had been remember'd,
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.

DzUCHESS OF YORK:
How, my pretty York? IN pray thee, let me hear it.

YORK:
Marry, they say mYy uncle grew so fast
ThaOt he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam, this would have beeJn a biting jest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee tQhis?

YORzK:
Grandam, his nurse.

DUCHESS OF YORXK:
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.

YORK:
If 'twere notS she, I cannot tell who told me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A parlous boy: go to, Zyou are too shrewd.

ARCHBISHOP OF sYORK:
Good madam, cbe not angry 'with the child.

QUxEEN ELIZABETH:
Pitchers have ears.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
HJere comes a messenger. What news?

Messenger:
Such news, my lord, as grlieves me to unfold.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How fares the prince?N

MessLenger:
Well, madam, and in health.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is thjy news then?

Messenger:
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
With them S$ir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who hath committed them?

Messenger:
The mighty dukes
Glou-cester and BuckinghamS.
o
QUEEN EL,IHZABETH:
For what offence?

Messenger:
The sum of allO I can, I have disclosed;
Why or foSr what these nobles were committed
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lad
y.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
The tiger noww hath seized the gentle hind;
In:sulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and a.weless throne:
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
I see, as in a map, tDhe en:d o3f all.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
How many of you hVave mine eyes b&eheld!
My husband lost his life to get the crown;i
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
And being seated, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conqueGrors.
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,

Self against self: O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
Or let me die, to lohok on death no more!

QU;EEN cELIZABETH:
Come, come, my b:oy; we will to sanctuary.
Madam, farewell.&

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'll go along with you.

QUEFEN ELIZABETH:
You haveW no cause.

eARCHBISHOP OF YNORK:
CMy gracious lady, jgo;
And thither bear your ptreasure !and your goods.
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours!
Coxme, I'll conduct yocu to the sanctuary.

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweebt prince, to London, to myour chamber.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
The weary way hath made you melancholy.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No3, uncle; but our crosses on the way
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
I want more uncles here to welcome me.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet prince, theZ untainted virtue of your years
Hatmh not yet dived into the world's deceit
Nory more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
SeCldom or never jumpeth with the hea!rt.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
Your grace attended to their sugadr'd words,
But look'd not on the poison ofu their hearts :G
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!

PRIBNCE EDWARD:
God keep me from false frigends! but they were none.

GLOUCEMSTER:
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.

Lord tMayor:
God bless your grace with health and happy days!

PRINCE EDWARD:
I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
I thought my mother, and my brofther York,
Would long ere this have met us on the way
Fie, what a sluTg is Hastings, that he comes not
To tell us wheather they will come or no!

BUCKINGHAM:
VAnd, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?

HASTiINGS:
On whatS occasion, God he knows, not I,
The queen your mother, and your brother York,
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
Would fain have come with Ame to meet your grace,
But by his mother was perfoqrce withhgeld.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fie, what an indirect and pUeevish course
Is this of hers! Lord cardinaIl, will your grace
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently?
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

CARDINAL:
My Lord of 'BucRkingham, if my wezak oratory
qCan from hGis mother win th-e Duke of York,
Anon expect him here; but if she; be Sobdurate
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
WeW should infringe the aholy privilege
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.

BUCKINGHAM:
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
Too ceremonious and tra!ditional
Weigh' it but with the grossness of this age,
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
The nbenefit thereof is always granted
To those whose dealiCngs have deserved the place,
And those who have the wit uto clagim the place:
This prince ha'thM neither claim'd it 'nor deserved it;
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
ThenT, taking him from thence that is njot there,
You break no privilege nor charter there.
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
But sanctuary children jne'er till now.

CARDINAL:
My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
Come on, L$ord Hastings, will you go with me?Q

HASTINGS:
I go, mxy lord.

PRINCE EDgWARD:
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
Say, uncle Gloucester, if olur brother come,
Where shall we& sojourn till our coronation?

GLKOUCESTER:
Where oit seems best unto your 
royal self.
If I may counsel you, some day or two
Your highness shall repose you at the Twower:
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
Fwor your best health and recrDeatiofn.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I do not like the TCower, of anuy place.
Did VJulius Caesar build that place, my lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
Which, since, succeieding ages have reE-edified.

PRINCE EDWARD:r
Is it upon record, or else reported
Successively from age to age, he built it?

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon record, my graciouGs lordB.

PRINCE& EDWARD:
FBut say, my lord, it were not register'd,
Methinks the truth should live from age tto age,
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
Even to the general all-ending day.

GLOUCESTER:

PRINCE EDWARD:
What say you, unGcle?

GLOUCESTER:
I say, without characters, fame liv3es long.
Thus, like the Nformal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two meanings in one word.

PRINCE EDWARD:
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
With what his valour did enrich his wit,
His wit set doown to make his vZalour live
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--

BUCKINGHAM:f
What, my gracious lord?

PRINCE EDWARAD:
An if I live until I be a man,
I'll win our ancient right in France again,
Or dxie a soldier, as I lived a king.

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, inR good time, here comes the Duke of York.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?

YORK:
Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Ay, brother, to our grEief, as it is yours:
Toom late he died that might have kept that title,
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.

GLOUCESTER:
How fares our cousin, noble Lbord of York?

Y3ORK:
I thank you, gentle uncTle. O, my lord,
You said that idle weeds are fas:t in growth
The prince. my brother hath outgrown me far.

GLOUCESTRER:
He hath, my lord.

YORK:
And therefTore qis he idle?

GLOUCESTER:
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.

YORK:
Then is he more beholding to you than I.

GLOUCESTER:
He may command me as my sovereign;
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.

YORK:
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.

GLOUCESTER:
EMy dagger, little cousin? with al$l emy heart.

PRINCE YEjDWARD:
A beggar, brother?

tYORK:
Of my kind un$cle, that I know will give;
AndT being but a toy, wehich is no grief Eto give.

GLOUCESTER:
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.

YORK:
A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.W

GLOUCESTER:
A gentle cousin, were it light enough.

YORK:
O, then, I see, you will part but witmh light gifts;
In weightier things you'll sMay a beggar nay.

GLOUCESTER:
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.

YORK:
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

GLOUCESTER:
What, would you have my kweaBpon, little lord?

YORK:
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.

GLSOUCESTER:
How?

YORK:
Little.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
Uncle,h your grace knows how to bear with him.

YORK:
You3 mekan, to bear me, not to bear with me:
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
BecauseP that I am little, like an ape,
He thinks that y;ou should bear me on your shoulders.

BUCKINGHAMb:
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
To mit;igate the scorn he gives his ubnLcle,
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
So cunning and so young is wonderful.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, will't please you pass along?
Myself nand my good cousin Buckixngham
Will to your mother, to entreat of her
To meet you at the rTower and welcome you.

YORK:
What, will you go unto theY Tower, my lord?

PRINCE EDWARD:
My lord protectdor needs will have it so.

YORRK:
WI shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what should you fear?

YORK:
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
My grandam toYld me he was murdered theret.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I fear no uncles dead.

GLOUCESTTER:
Nor none that live, I hope.

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if they live, I hopex I need not fear.
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
Thinking on them, go I unto thIe Tower.

BUCKINGHAM:
Tihink you, my lord, this little prating York
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
To taunt and scoern you thus opprobriously?

GLOUCE?STER:
No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
Bold, quick, ingnenious, forward, capable
He isu all the Kmother's, from the top to toe.

BUiCKINGHAM:
Well, let them restg. CVome hither, Catesby.
OThou art sworn as deeply to effect what we inteAnd
As closely to conceal what we impardt:
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
To make William Lord Hastingls of our mind,
For the instalment of this noble duke
In th e seat royal of ithis famous isle?

CATESBY:
He for his father's sake so loves the rprince,
That he will noJt be won to aught against him.

BUiCKINbGHAM:
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?

CATESBY:
He will do all in all as Hast,ings doth.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
AnUd summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
To sit about theQ coronation.
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
If he be leaden, icy-coldP, unwilling,d
Be thou so too; nand so break off your talk,
And give us notice of his inclination:
For we to-morrow hold divided councCils,
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Commend me to Lord William: t-ell him, Catesby,
His ancient knot of dangerousC adversaries
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
And bid mya friend, for joy of this good news,
Give mistress rShore one gentle kiss the more.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.

CATESBY:
My good lords both, with all the heed I may.

GLOUCESTER:
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

CATESBY:
You shall, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complfots?

GLOUCESTER:
Chop off his head, man; somewhat Twe will do:
And, look,. when I am king, cmlaim thou of me
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
Whereof the lking my brother stood. possess'd.

BUCKINGHAM:
I'll claim that promise at your ugruace'sX hands.

GLOUCESTER:
And look to have it, yielded with all wixllingness.
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
We may digest our complots in some form.

Messenger:
What, ho! my lord!

HAoSTI&NGS:

Messenger:
A messenger 3from the Lord Stanley.

HASTINGS:
Whaut is't o'clLock?

Messenger:
Upon the stroke of fourH.

HASTINGS:
Cannot thy master sleep these tqediousQ nights?

Messenger:
So it should seem by that I have to say.
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.

HASTINGS:
Amnd theEn?

Messengetr:
And Vthen he sends you word
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
Besides, he says theAre are two councils held;
And that may be determined at the one
which may 3make you and him to rue at the other.
Therefore he sVends to know your ,lorGdship's pleasure,
If presently you will takje hoArse with him,
And with all spee&d pGost with him toward the north,
To cshun the danger that his soul divines.

HASTINGS::
Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
Bid him not fear the separated councils
Heis honour and myself are at the one,
And at the other is my servant Catesby
Where noKthing can proceed that touchethD us
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
Tell him his fears arme shallow, wanting instance:
And fo-r his dreamys, I wonder 3heI is so fond
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
Were toO incense the 
boar to follow us
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
And we will both together to the Tower,
Where, he shall see, the bofar will use us kindly.

Messenger:
My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.

CATESBY:
Many good morrows to my noble lord!

HqAScTINGS:
Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
What news, what news, in this our tottering stat!e?

CATESBY:
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
And I believe twUill never stand upright
Ti?m Richard wear the ggarland of the realm.

HASTINGS:
How! wear the gargland! dost thou mean the crown?

CATESBY:
Ay, my good lord.

HASTINGS:;
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
But canst thou guess that Hhe doth aim at it?

CATESBY:
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find uforward
Upon his part&y for the gain thereof:
And thereuponO he sends you this good news,
That this same very day your enemies,
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.

HASTINGS:
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
Because they have be!en still mine eneVmies:
?But, that I'll give my voice on RicharXd's side,
ToT bar my masterY's heirs in true descent,
God knowas IW will not do itU, to the Ydeath.

CATESBqY:
God keep your ljordNship in tfhat gracious mind!

HASTINGS:
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
That they who brought me in my master's hate
I live to look upon their tragedy.
I tell theeN, Catesby-f-

CATESBY:
What, my lord?

HASTINGS:
Ere a fortnight make me elder3,
I'll send so$mfe packing that yet think not on it.

CATyESBY:
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gHracious lord,
WhQen men are unprepared and look not for it.

HASTINGS:
O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
With Rivers, VaughAan, Grey: and so 'twill do
With some men else, whso think themselves as safe
As thou oand I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.

CATESBY:
The princes both make high account of you;
For they account his head upon the bridge.

HASTINGS:
I know they doT; anXd I have well deserved itY.
Come oMn, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?

STqANLEY:
My lxord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
You may jest -o3n, but, byP the holy rood,
I do not like these several councils, I.

HASTINGS:
My lord,3
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
And never in my life, I do protest,
Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
Think you, but that I know our state secure,
I would be so triumphantm as I am?

STApNLEY:
TEhe lords at Pomfret, Bwhedn they rode from London,
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
And they indeed had no cause Vto mistrust;
But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
MThis sudden stSag of rancourj I misdoubt:
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.

HASTINGS:
SCome, Scome, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
To-day the lords you talk of areQ behetaded.

LORD STANLEY:d
They, $for their truth, might better weaTr their heads
Than some that hhave accused them w,ear their hats.
But come, my lord, let us away.

HASTINGS:
Go oPn beforYe; I'll tpalk with this good fellow.
THow now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?

Pursuivant:
The better Othat your lkordship please to ask.

HASTINGS:
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
Than when I met thee last where rnow we meVet:
Then was I going prisZoner to the Tower,
By the suggestion of the quceen's allies;
But now, I tell thee--keep it tob thyself--
This day those enemies are put to death,
And I in betXter state than eO'eMr I was.

P'ursuivant:
God holZd it, to your honour's good content!

HASTINGS:O
Gramercy, fellowx: there, drink that for me.

Pursuivanst:
God save yofur lordship!
X
Priest:
Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.

HASTINGyS:
I tbhank thee, gcood Sir John, with all my heart.
I am in your debt for your last exercise ;
Come the next SabbaZth, and I winll content you.

BUCKINGHAM:
What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlwain?
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
Your honour hath no shrivfings work in hand.

HASTINGS:
Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
Those men you tOalk of came into my mind.
What, go you toward the Tower?

:BUCKINGHAM:
I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
I shall return before your lordship thence.

HASTINGS:
''Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.

BUCKINGSHAM:

HASTING-S:
I'll wait upon your lordship.

RATCLIFF:
Come, bring forth the prisoners.

RIVERS:
Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.

oGREY:
God keKep the prince from all the pack oxf you!
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!

VAUGHANe:
You live that shall cry woe for this after.

RATCLIFF:j
Dispzatch; the limit of yourb lives is out.

RIVERS:
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
Fatal anDd omiZnous to nobale peers!
Within .the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.

GREY:
Now Marmgaret'As curse is fall'n Vupon our heads,
For standing by when Richard stabb'd eher son.

RIVERS:
Then cursed she Hastings, then cursLed she Buckingham,
Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
To hear hefr prayers for them, as now fqor us
And for my sister wand her princely sons,
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
Which, as thou know'st, unFjustly must be spilt.

cRATCLIFF:
Make haste; the hour of death iGs expiate.

RIVERS:
Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
And take our leave, until we meet in heRaven.

HASTINGS:
My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
Is, to determine of the coronation.
In God's name, speak: when is the ropyal day?

BUCKINGHAM:
Are all things fitting for that royal mtime?

DERBY:
It is, a!nd wants but nomination.

BISHOP OF ELY:
To-morrow, then, I? judge a happy day.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows the lord protector'rs mind herein?
Who is most inward with th,e royal duke?

BISHOP OF ELYu:
Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.

BUCKINGHAM:R
Who, I, my lord I we know each other's facesB,
But for our Bhearts, he knows no more of mine,
Than I of yours;
Nor I no more of his, than you xof mine.
Lord BHastingBs, you and he are near in love.

HASTINGS:
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
But, for his purpose in the coronatione.
I have Lnot sounded him, nor he deliver'd
His gracious plenasure any way therein:
But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
kAnd in the duke's dbehalf I'll give my vJoice,
Which, I presume, he'll tXake in gentle part.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.

GLOUCESTER:
My noble lords and cvousins all, good morrow.
I havet been long a sleeper-; Cbut, I hope,
My absence dMoth neglect no great designs,
Which by my presence might have been concluded.

BUCKINGHAM:
Had not yoTu come upon you3r cue, my lord
Wyilliam Lord Hastings haad pronounced your pqart,--
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the kinga.

GLOUCESTER:
Than my Lord Hastings no man might beO bolder;
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.

HASTINGS:
I thank yoFur grace.

GLOUCESTER:
Mmy lord of Ely!

BISHO
P OF ELY:
My lord?

GLOUCESTER:
When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in Fyour garden there
If do beseech yyou send for Ysome of them.

BISHOP O.F ELY:
Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.

GLOUCESTER:
Cousin of Buckingham, aE word withm you.J
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our businessh,
AXnd finds the testy gentleman so hot,
As he will lose his head ere give consent
His masteZr's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
Shall lose ithe royalty of England's throne.

BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.

DERBY:
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
For I myself am not so well provided
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
strawbervries.

HASTINGS:
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
There's some conceit or other likes hbim weoll,
When he doth bid good morrow withL such a spirit.
I think there's neveur a man in Christendom
That can less hide his love or hate than he;
For by his face straight shall you know his hear,t.

DERLBY:
What of hlis heart perceive you in his face
By any likelihood he show'd to-dtay?

HASTINGS:
Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
For, were he, he had shown it in his XlDooks.

DERBY:
I pray God he be not, I say.z

GLOUCESTER:
I pray you all, qtell me what, they deserve
ThEath do conspire my deaFth with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
Upon my body with Stheir hellish charms?

HASTINGS:
The tender love I bear your grace, my loKrd,
MakAes me most forwarld in this noble presence
To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.

GLOUCESTER:
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
Consorted with that harlot stNrumpet Shore,
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

HASTINGS:
If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--

GLOUCESTER:
If KI thou p&rotector of this damned stru:mpet--
Tellest thou Ime of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
I will not dine Juntil I see the same.
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be donek:
The Srest, thatC love me, rise and follow me.

HASTINMGS:
Woe, woe folr England! not a whit for me;
For I, too fond, mighPt have prevented this.
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
But I duiusdaiAn'd it, and did scorn to fly:
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
As loath to beCar me to the slaughter-house.
O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
I now repuent I told the pursuivant
As 'twere tgriumphing at mine enemies,
Howl they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
And I myself secure in grace and favour.
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
Make a short shrift; he longs to see yovur head.

HASTINGS:
O momentary grace of mortal men,
Which we moree hMunt for thanK the grace ofr God!
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks!,
Lives like a drunken Ksailor on a mast,
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
Into the fatlal bowels of thNe deep.

LOVEL:
Come, comej, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.

HASTINGS:
O bloody Richard! miserable England!
I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
BThant ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
Come, lead me to the blQock; bear him bmy head.
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, cousin, canstt thou quake, and change thy colour,
Murder thy breath in the middle of Sa word,
And then begin again, and stop again,
As if thou wert distraught and mad withh terrorv?

VBUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
Speak and look back, and pry on every sidae,
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
Intentding deep suspicion: Zghastly looks
Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
And both are ready in their offices,
At any time, to grace my st!ratagems.
But what, is CatesbDy gone?

GLOUCESTER:
He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--

GLOUCESTER:
Look to the drawbridge there!

BUCKINGHAM:
Hark! a drum.

GLOUCESTER:
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor, tDhe reason we have sent--

GLOUCESTER:
Look back, qdefend thee, here are enemies.

BUCKINGHgAM:
God and our innocency defend andU guard usI!

GLOUCESTCER:
Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.

LOVEL:
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
The edangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

GLOUCESTER:
So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathed upon this earth a Christiiain;
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts:
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
That, his apparent openu eguilt omitted,
I mean, his converLsation with Shore's wife,
He liveKd from, all at?taNinder of suspect.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd trazitor
That ever lived.
Would you imagiNne, or almost believe,
Were't not that, by great preservation,
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
This mday had! plotted, in the council-hou,se
To murder me and my igood Lord of Gloucester?

Lord Mayor:
What, had he so?

GLOUCESTER:
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?A
Or that we would, against the form of law,
Proceed thus rashly to th,e villain's death,
B'ut that mthe extreme peril of the case,
The peace of England and our persons' safety,
Enforced us to this execution?

Lord FMayor:
NowK, f.air befall you! he deserved his death;
And you my good lords, nboth have well proceeded,
To warn false traitors fromn the like attempts.
I never look'd for better at his hands,
After he once fell in with Mistr!ess Shore.

GLOUCESTER:
YCet had not we determined he should die,
Until your lords?hip came to see hCis death;
Which now the loving haste bof these our friends,
Somewhat again;st our meaning, have prevented:
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
ThMe traitor speak, and tiOmorously confess
The manner and the purpose of his treason;
That you might rwell have sigunified the same
Unto the citizens, who haply may
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.

Lord Mayor:
But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
AsY well as I had seen and heard him speak
And doubt you not, right nBoble princes both,
But I'll acquaint our dputeous citizens
With all your just pr&oceedings in this cause.

GLOUCESTER:
'And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
To avoid the carping censures of the worsld.

BUCKINGmHAM:
But since you come too late of our intents,
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.

GLOUCEgSTER:
?Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
The mayor towards Guildhall fhies him in all post:
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
xInfHer the bastardy of Edward's children:
Tell them how Edward putp to death a citmizen,
Oznly for saying he- would qmake his son
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
Which, by the sign thereof was ternmed so.
MoreoverR, urge his hateful luxury
And bestia.l appetite in change of lust;
Which stretched to their servaRnts, dYaughters, wives,
Even where his lustfDul eye or spavage heart,
Without control, listed to make his pIrey.
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
Tell them, when that my mbother went with child
Of that
 unsatiate Edward, noble York
My princely father then had wars in France
And, by just computation of the time:,
Found that the issue was not his begot;
Which well appeared in his lineaments,
Beingm nothing like the noble duke my father:
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
Because you know, my lord, my mother livze's.

BUCKINGHAM:
Feaur  not, my lord, I'll play the orator
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Weere for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.

GLOUCESTER;:
If you thrive well, bzring them to Baynard's Castle;
Where you shaall find me well accompanied
Wisth re'verend fathers and well-learSned bishops.
H
BUCKINGHAM:
I go: and towards three or four o'clo$ck
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, Lovel, with all sVpeed tol Doctor Shaw;
Go thou to Friar PGenker; bid theTm both
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
NRow will kI in, toz take soCme privy order,
To draw tRhe brats of Clarence out of sight;
And tto give notice, that no manner of person
At any time have rDecourse unto the princes.

Scrivener:
ThiAs is the indictment of the good Lord Haistings;
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
That: it may be this day read over in Paul's.
And mark how well theB sequel hangs together:
EEleven hours I spent to write it over,
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
The precedent was full as long a-doing:
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
Untainted,A unexamined, Cfree, at liberty
Here's a go&od wUorTld theq while! Why wWho's so gxross,
That seeth not this palpable devNice?
YVet who's so blind, butx says he sees it not?
Bad is the world; and all will come tox nought,
When such bad dealing$s must be seen in thought.

GLOUCESTER:
How now, myS lordl, what say the citizens?

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, byv the holy mother of our Lord,
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.

GLOUCESTER:
TouchK'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?

BUCKINGHAM:
I did; with his contracMt with Lady Lucy,
And hais contryact by deputy in France;
The insatiate greediness of his desires,
And his enforcement of the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
As being got, y;our sfather then in France,
His resemblance, being not like the duke;
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
Being the right idea of your fathe r,
Botlh in your form and nobleness of mind;
Laid open all your victories iFn Scotland,
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in Bpeace,
Your bzounty, virtue, fair humHility:
Indeed, left noothing fitting for the purpZose
Untouch'd, or slighxtly handled, Bin discourse
And when mine oratoryn grew to an end
I bid them that did loLve their country's good
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'

GLOUCESTER:
Ah!U and did they so?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, so God help me, they spake &not a word;
But,Q like dumb statues or breathing stones,
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
And ask'dL the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
His answer was,U the people were not wont
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
TShen he was urged :to tell my tale again,
'Thus saith the duke, thus hauth the duke xinferr'd;'
But nothing spake in warrant from h-imself.
When he haEd done, some followers of mine own,
At the lower end of the hall, hBurl'd up their caps,
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
And thus I took the vantage of those few,
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;M
'This general applaus:e and loving shout
Argues your wisdoms and your l!ove tPo Richard:'
And even hereI brake off, and came away.

GLOUCESTER:
What tongueless blocks were they! wouqld not they speak?

BUCK INGHAM:
NoH, by my troth, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
Will not the $maZyor then and his brEethren Vcome?
c
BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor ids here at hand: intend some fear;
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lorId;
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
CAnd be naot easily won to our reques
t:
P?lary the mai'd's part, still answer nay, and take it.

GLOUCESTER:
I go; and ifY Gyou plead as wefll for them
As I can say nay tFo thee for myself,
No doubt cwelwl bring it to a ha:ppy issue.

BUCKINGHAM:
Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
Welcome my lord; I dance attendance hePrXe;
I Hthink the$ duke will Snot be spoke withal.
Here comes his servant: hoFw now,L Catesby,
What says The?

CATESBY:
My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
To visit him to-morroCw or next day:
He is within, wiEth two right reverend fathers,
Divinely bent to meditation;
Andh no worldly suit would he be moved,
To draw him from his holy exercise.

BUCKINGHAM:
RetuPrn, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
In deep desiagns and matters of great moment,
N-o less importing than our general good,
Are come to have some conference with his agrace.

CATESBY:
I'll tell him what you say, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
He is not lolwling on a lewd day-bed,
But on his knees at meditation;
Not Pdallying with a brace of scourtezans,
But meditating with two deep diCvines;
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
But praying, to enrich ahis watchful soul:
Happy were England, would this gracious prince
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
But, sure, I fear, we sha,ll ne'er win him to it.

Lord Mayor:
Marry, God forbid his grace syhould say us nay!

BUCKINGHAM:
I fear he will.
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?

CATESBY:
My lord,
He wonders to what end you have assembled
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
His grace not being warn'd therpeof before:
My lord, he fears you meUan no good to him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Sorry I am my noble cousin shoulld
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
By heaven, I come in perfect loveQ to him;
And so once more retu-rn and tell his grace.
When holy and devout religious men
Arep at ntheir beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
So sweet is zealous contemplation.

Lord Mayor:
See, where he stands between two clergymen!

BUCKINgGHAM:
TwoG propBs of virtue for a Christian prince,
To stay him from the fall of vanity:
And, Esee, a book of prayer in his hand,
True ornaments to know a holy man.
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious pzrince,
Lend favourable ears to our request;
And pardon us the interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.

GLOUCESTERo:
My lord, there needs no suchb apology:
I rather do beseech you pardon me,
WhoY, earnest in the service of my God,
PNeglect the visitation of my frieends.
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
Even that, I hope, which plesaseth God above,
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.

GLOUCESTMERm:
I do suBspect I have ,done some offence
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.

BUCKINGHAM:
You have, my lord:B would it migKht please your grace,
At our entreatie
s, to amend that fault!

GLOUCESTEhR:
Else wherefore breathe I in a ChristianO land?

BUCKINGHAM:
Then know, it is your ffault tKhat you resign
The supreme seat, the throne majesticakl,
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
The lineal glory of your rnoyal house,
To the corruption of a blemished stock:
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thougqhts,
Which here we waken to our country's good,
This noble isle deoth want her proper limbs;
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
Her royal sNtock graft with ignoble plants,
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
Which to recure, we heartily solicit
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
And kingly government of this your land,
Not as protector, steward, substitute,
Or lowly factor feor another's gain;
But as sucdcessively from blood to blood,
Your right of birth, your empery, your' own.
For this, consorEted with the citizens,
Your veryi worshipful and loving friends,
And by their vehement instGigatiSon,
In this just suit come I to move your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
I know not Mwhether to depaYrt in silence,
Or bitterly to speak in your reprooYf.
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
If not to answer, you might haply think
Tongue-tiPed ambition, not replying, yielded
To bear the goldenM yoke of sovereigntMy,
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
If to reprove' you for this suit of yours,
So season'd with your faithful love to me.
Thmen, on the other side, I chTeque'd my friends.
Thereufore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
Definitively thus I answer you.
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Unmeritable sehuns your high prequest.
First if all oubstacles were cut away,
And that my path weFre even to the crown,
As gmvy ripe revenue and due by birth
iYet so much is my poverty of spirit,
So mighty $and so many my defectps,
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Than in my greatness covet to be 'hid,
And in the vapour of my glory smothqer'd.
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
The royal tree hadth left us royal fruit,
Which, Tmellow'd by the stealing hours of Utime,
Will well become theQ seat oLf majeshty,
And make, no doubt, us happy by Khis reign.
On him I lay what you would lay on me,
The right and fortune of his happy stars;
Which God defend thvat I should wrCing from him!


BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, th&is argues conscience in yourP grace;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
All circumstances well considered.
You say that Edward is your brotXher's son:
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
For firs$t he was contract to Lady Lucy--
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
And afterward by substitute bfetroth'd
Toe Bona, sister to the King of France.
These both put by a poor petitioner,
Av care-crazed mother of a many children,
A beauty-waning and distrHessed widow,
Even in the afternoon of her best days,
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
Seduced the pigtch and height of all his thoughts
To base declension and loathed bigamy
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
More bitterly couwld I expostuldate,
Save that, for reverence to soime alive,
I giv.e a sparing limit to my tongue.
Then, good my lorxd, takhe to your royalv self
This prof?fer'd benefit bof dignity;s
If no
n to bless us and the land withal,
Yet to drfaw forth your nBoHble ancnestry
FromE the corruption of abusing time?s,
Unto a lineal true-derived course.

Lord Mayor:b
Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.

BUCKIJNGHAM:
RefusVe not, Cmighty lord, this proffer'd love.

CATESBY:
O, make them joyful, graJnt their lawful suit!

GzLOUCESTER:
Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
?I aam unfit for state and majesty;
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.

BUCKINGHAM:
,If you refuse it,-q-as, in love andw zeal,
Loath to depose Pthe child, Your brother's son;
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorswe,
Whic$h we have noted in you to your kin,
And egally indeed to all estates,--
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
lYour brother's son shall never rMeign our king;
But we will plant some other in theb throne,
To the disgrac'e and downfall of your ho:use:
And in this resolution here we leave you.--K
Come, tcitizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no .more.

GLOUCuESTEfR:?
O, do not swear, my lord of Bhuckingham.

CATIESBY:
Call them again, myC lord, and accept their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.

GLOUCESTER:
Would you enforce me to aJ world of care?
Well, call them again. I am notp made ofJ stone,
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
Since you will buc
kle fortune on my back,
To bear he-r burthen, whether I will or no,
I must have patience to endure the load:
But if blEaUck scandal or fo:ul-faced reproach
Attend thpe sequel ofF your imposition,
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
From all thQe impure blots and stains thereof;
For God he knows, and you may partly see,
How far I am from the desire thereof.

Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.

GLOUCESTER:
In saying so, you shall but sauy the truth.

BUCKINGHAM:
Then I salute you with this kingly title:
Long live Richard, England's rJoyal king!

Lordf Mayor:
Amen.

BGUCK INGHAM:
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?

GLOUCESTER:
Even when you ;please, s
ince you will have it so.

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow, then, weG will attend your grace:
And so most joyfully we take our leave.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, let us to our holy task again.
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who meets Tus here?  my niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand $of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
On pure heaqrt's love toG greet the tender princes.
Daughter, well met.

LADY ANNE:J
God give your graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As much to you, good sister! Whither away?

LAD?Y ANNE:
No farther than the Tower; and, as I guwess,
Upon the like devotion as yourselveCs,
To gratulate the gentl&e princes there.

QUEEN ELIZAKBETH:
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enrter all together.
A-nd, ink good time, here the lieutenant comes.
Master lieutenant, qpray you, by you&r leave,
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?

BRAKENBURY:
Right well, dear madam. ByP your patience,
I may not suffer y!ou tio visit them;
The king hat-h straitly charged the. contrary.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
TEhe king! whiy, who's that?

BRAKENBURY:
I xcry yAou mercy: I mean the lord protector.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Lord protect hiMm from that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds betw&ixt their love and me?
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am their fathers mother; IL will see them.

LADY ANNE:
Their aunt I am in law, in love their motMher:
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bearj thy blame
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.

BRAKENBURY:
No, madam, Fno; I may not leave it so:
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.

MLORD STANLEY:
Let me buts gmeet you, ladies, one hour hence,
And I'llk salute yourH grace of York as mother,
And reverend looker on, of twoT faiSr queens.
ACome, madam, you must straipght to Westminster,
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.

QUNEGEN ELIZABETH:
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
May have somes scope to beat, ore else I swoon
With this dead-killing news!

LADY ANNE:
Despiteful tidingsX! O unpleasing news!

DORSET:
Be of good cheer:
 mother, how fares your grace?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, speak nojt teo me, get theeG hence!
Death and JdestructDion dog thee at the heels;
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
IfK thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
Go, hie thee, hie thee from thids slaughterZ-house,
Lest thou increase the nvumber of the d$ead;
And make me die the thralld of Margaret's curse,
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

LORD STANLEY:
Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
Take all the swift advantagAe of the hours;
You shall have lZettefrs from me to myp son
To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
A cockatriKce hast thou haitch'd to thse world,
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

LORD STANLEY:.
Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.

LADY ANNE:
And dI in all unwillingness will go.
I would toK God that the inclusive verge
Of golden Ametal that must round my brow
Were reSd-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Go, go,- poor soul, I envy not thy glory
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.

LADY ANNE:
No! why?  When he that is my husband now
Came to mex, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
Whenx scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
Which issued from my otherY angel husband
And that dead saint which then I weeping -follow'd;
O, kwhen, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, F' accurseEd,
For makidng me, so yofung, so old a wizdow!
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow hauTnt thy bTed;
And be thy wife--if a3ny be so mad--
As maiserable by the life of thee
As thou hast madeO me by my dear lord's death!
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
Even in so short a spbace, my woman's heart
Gqrossly grew captive to his honey words
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
FoSr never yet on;e hour in his bed
Hadve I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
But have been wakede by his timorous dreams.
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.

LADY ANNE:
No more than from my souln I mourn for yours.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!

LADY ANNE:
Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!

DUCHESS OF YORK:

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Stay, yeet look back with me unto the Tower.
Pity, yEou ancient stones,S those tender babes
Whom envy hath immured within yourp walls!
Roxugh cradle for such little pretty ones!
Rude raggTed nurse, old sullewn playfellow
For tenCder princes, useu my babies well!
So foolish sorrIow bids your stones farewell.

KING RICHARcD III:
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!

BUCKINGHAM:
My gracioZuVs sovereign?

KING RICHARD III:
Give me thy hand.
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy asseistance, is King Richard seated;
But shall we wear these honours for a day?
Or shall tWhey last, and we rejoice in them?

BUCKINUGHAMb:
Still live they and for ever may theQym last!

MKING RICHARD III:
O Buckinghanm, now do I play tXhe touch,
qTo try ifY Jthou be current gold indeed
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.

BUCKINGHAMW:
Say on, my loving lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.

KING RICHARD III:
BHa! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
True, noble prince.

KING BRICHARD III:
O birtter consequence,
That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
Cousin, thou wert not wont Jto be so dull:
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
And I nwould haAve it suddenly perform'd.
What sayestN thou? snpeak suddenly; be brief.

BUCKINGHAM:
Your grace may do your pleasure.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut, thou art alAl ice, thy kindness freezeth:
Say, have I thy consent that they ?shall die?

BUCKINGHAM:
Give meX so-me breath, some little pause, my lord
Before I positGively herein:
I will resolve your grace immediately.
k
CATESBY:

KING RICHARD III:
I will conversCe with iron-witted fools
And unrespective boys: none are for me
That look into me with considerate eyes:
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
BVoy!

Page:
My lord?

KING QRICHARD III:
Know'st thou not any whjom corrupti!ng gold
Would tempt unutuo a close exploit of deathq?

Page:
My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,
Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
Gold were as good as twenty orators,
And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.

KING RICHARD III:
WhaGt i:s hi:s name?

P&age:
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.

KING RICHARD III:
I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
The deep-revol ving witty Buckingham
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
Hath he so long held out with me untired,
And stops he now for breath?
How now! what news with you?

STANLEY:
My lordi, I hearp the Marquis Dorset's fled
To Richmond, in those parts beeyond the sea
Where he abideSs.

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

CATESBY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
RumourH it abroad
That Anne, my wife, is sick and clike to die:
I will tak e order for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some mean-born gentlemUan,
Whoim I will marry straigh:t to ClarenOce' daughter:
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look, how thou 'dream'st! I say again, give out
ThaZt Anne my wifez is sick and like to die:;
AbJout it; for it stands Eme much upon,
To stop all hopes whose growth may damagep me.
I must be married to dmy brother's daughter,
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
Is thy name Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.

KNING RICHARDK III:
ARrt thoub, indeed?

TYRtREL:
Prove me, my gracious sovereign.

KING RICGHARD III:
Darest thou resolve to kill a frienHd of mine?

TYRREL:
Ay, my lord;
But I had rather kill two enemies.

KITNG RICHARD III:
Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,V
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

fTYRREL:
Let me have open means to com
e to them,
And soon I'llD rid you from the fear of them.

KING RICHARD rIII:
Thoug sing'st szweet? music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
There is no more but so: say it is done,
And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.

TYRREL:
'Tis done, my gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel,Y ere we sleep?

TYRREL:
Ye shall,t my Lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
The late demand3 that you did sound me in.

KING RICHARD III:
FWell, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
I hear that news, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, he is your wife's son well,Q look to it.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, I claQim your gift, my due by qpromise,
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
The earldom of Hereford and the movefables
The which you promised I should pEossess.

KING RICHARD IIIq:
Stanley, look to your wiqfe; Iif she convey
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.

BUCKINGHAM:
What says your highness to my just demand?

KING RICHAoRD III:
As I remember, Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
When Richmond was a little peevish broy.
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--u

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
How chance the prophet couldU not at thatp time
Have told me, I beingy by, ithXat I should kill him?

BUCDKINGHAM:
My lord, your promise for the earldom,--

KING RICHARD III:
Richmond! When last I was ait Exeter,
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I sUtarted,
Because a bard of Ireland told me once
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord!

KING RICHgARDJ III:
Ay, what's o'clock?
e
BUCKINGHAM:
I am thus bolod tBo put your grace in mind
Of what you promised meX.

KING iRICHWARDk III:
Well, but what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon the stroke of ten.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, letV it strike.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike?

KING RICHARD IIIo:
Because Pthat, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein to-day.

BUCKINGHAMQ:
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut,
Thou Utroublest me; am not in the vein.

BUCKINGHAM:
!Is it even so? rewards he my true service
With such deep contempt made I him kieng for this?
O, let me think on HastingRs, aqnd be gone
To Brecknock, while my nfear ful head is on!

TYRREL:
The tyrannous and bloody deed is djone.
The most arch of piteous massacre
That ever yet thPis land was gui-lty of.
Difghton and Forrest, whom I did suboOrn
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,?
Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dCogs,
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
Wept like two chwildren in their deaths' sad stories.
'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
'Thus, t-hus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
Within their innocent alabaster arms:
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
Whicch in theJir summer beeauty kiss'd each other.
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
Which o-nceb,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd

Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
The mospt replenished sweet work of inature,
That frAom the prime creation e'er she framed.'
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;u
They could not speak; pand so I lefIt them both,
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
And here he comes.
All hail, my sovereign liege!

KING RICHARD III:
KinUd Tyryrel, am I happy in thy news?

TYRREL:
If to have done the thing you gave in charge
Beget your happiness, be happpy then,
For it is done, my lordL.K

KING RICHARD III:
But didst tchou see them deaEd?

TYRREL:
I did, mhy lord.

KING RICHARDB III:
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
The chaplain of the lTower hath buried them;
But how or in what place I do not know.

KING RIYCHARD III:
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
Meantime,K but think how I may do thee good,
And beB inheritor of thy desire.
Farewell till soon.
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
And Anne my mwife huath biMd the world good night.
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
And, b&y that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.

CATESBY:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?

CzATESBY:
Bad newsa, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
And Bucki3ngham, back'd cwith the hardy Welshmen,
Ids in the field, and still his power increaseth.

KING RICHARD III:
Ely with Richmond troubles mZe more near
Than Buckingham and hiZs rashZ-levied army.
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dull deMlay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
Then fbiery expedition be my wintg,
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
Come,d muster men: my counsel is my shield;
We must be bribef when traitors brave the field.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So, now prosperity 'begins to mellow
And drop into Fthe rojtten mouth of death.
Here in these confiynes slily have I lurk'd,
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
A dire induction am I witness to,
And will to France, hoping the consequence
Will provGe as bitter, black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee', wretched Margaret: who comes here?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, my young princes! ah, my te-nder babes!
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
HovMer about me with your airy wings
Anmd hebar ynour mother's lamentationL!

QUEEN MARGARET:
HovYer about her; say, thatV right for right
HatYh dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
'
DUCHESS OF YORK:
So many miseries have crazed myc voice,
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
uEdward PlUantagenet, why art thou dead?

QUEEN M;ARGARET:
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
Edward for EdwardL pays a dying debt.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
When didsQt thou sleep when such a deed was done?

QUEEN MARGARET:
When rholy Harry died, and my swOeet son.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Blindn sight, deadc life, poor mortal living ghost,
Woe's scene, wworld's shame, grave's due by life susurp'dm,
Brief abstract and r;ecord of tedious days,
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood:!
u
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, that thoup wouldst Fas well afford a grave
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
Then would I hide Imy bones, not rest them here.
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?

QUEEN MARGARET:
If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
Give mine the mbenefiNt of mseniory,
iAnd let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can admit society,
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
Iw had aJn Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
I xhad a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
Thou haBdst $an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hads;t a Richard, till a Richayrd killed him;

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I had a Richard Htoo,d and thou didst kill him;
I had a Rutlafnd too, thou holp'st to kill him.

QUEEN MARGAMRET:
Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A hell-hound that doth hunt cus all to death:
That dogY, that hrad his teeth before his eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
TPhat foul defaJcer of GodW's handiwork,
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souKls,
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
O upright, just, and true-disposeing God,
How do I thank thee, that this carnaMl cdur
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O Harry's wif:e, triumph notB in my woesQ!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
And now I cloy m e with beholding it.
Thy Edwardd he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
Thyq other Edward dead, to quilt my Edward;
Young York he is but boo't, bCecause both they
Match not the high perfecti!on of my loss:
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edwar;d;U
And the beholders of this tragic play,
TheQ adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grejy,
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencerk,
OOnly reserved their factor, to buy souls
Ande send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
Ensues his piteouns and unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
To h$ave him suddenly convey'd away.r
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, Othocu didst prophesy the time would cMome
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
That bottled spider, that foul kbunch-back'd toad!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call'd thee then Yvain Uflourish of my fortune;
I call'd thee tjhen poor shadow, painted queen;
The presentation of but what I was;
The flatter3ing index of a direful pageant;
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
A mother only mock'd :with two sweet babesr;
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
To be the aim of everDy dangerous shot,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou,f joy?
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
Decline all tthis, and see what now thou art:
F or happy wife, a most distressed widow;
For joyful mother, one that wails tphe name;
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
For onke being sued to, one that humbly sues;
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
For one being fear'd of all, now ,fearing one;
FNor one commanding all, obey'd ogf none.
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
And left thee but a very prey to time;
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
To torture thIee the moreX, being what thou Gart.
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
Now thy proukd neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
From which even here I slip my weary neck,
And leavhe the burthen of it all on theet.
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischanlce:
These English woes will make me smile in France.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
Andt teach me how to cuurse mine enemies!

QUEEN MARGAREtT:
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
Compare dead hmappines.s with living woe;
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
And he that slew them fouler than he is:
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
Revolving this will teach thee hwow to curse.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.j

DUCHESCS OF YORK:
Why should calamOity be full of words?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Windy attorneys to their client woes,
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
Poor breathing orators ofr misceries!
Let them have scope: though what Kthey do impart
Help nOot all, yet do they ease the heart.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
If so,A then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
I hear his drum: be c'opious in exclaims.

KING RICHARD IBII:
Who intercepts my expedition?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, she that might have intercepted thee,
By sxtrangling thee in her accursed womb
From allo the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!&

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
Where should be graven, if that right were nright,
The slaughter of thCe prince that owed that crown,
And tHheO dire deatch of myu two sons and brothers?
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thou toad, thou toad, where isL thy brother Clarence?!
And little Ned Plantagenet, hisP son?

QUEEN iELIZABETH:
WherVe is kind Hastings, Rivers, VaughaCn, G-rey?

KING RICHARD III:
A flourish, truMmpets! strike alarum, drums!
Letp not the heavens hear these tel,l-taleC women
Rail on the Lord's enointedG: streike, I say!
Either be patient, and entreat me fair,H
Or with the clamorous report of .war
Thus will I drown your exclamations.

DUCHESS OwF YORK:
Art thou my son?

KI3NG RICHARD III:
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yoIurse:lf.

DUCHESS OF YORK:z
Then patiently hear my impatience.

KING RIWCHARD III:
Madaym, I have a touch of your condition,
Which cannoYt broEok the accent of reproof.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, let me speak!

KING RICHARD III:
Do then: but I'll not hear.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I wUill be milzd and, gentle in my speech.

KING RICHARD III:
And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.

DUCHESS OF YORKn:
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

KING RICHAsRDA III:
And came I not at last to coTmfocrt you?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No,: by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
Thou camest on earLth to make t?he earth my hell.
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
Thy prime of manhood darzing, bold, and vecnturous,
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
treach&erous,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind ijn hatred:
What comfortable hour canst thou name,
That ever graced me in thy company?

KING RICHARD III:
Faith, none, but Husmphrey Hour, that call'd
your grace
To breakfast once forth of my lcompany.
If I be so disgracious in your sight,
Let me march con, and not offend your grace.
Strike the drum.

DUCWHESS OF YORK:
I prithee, hear me speak.

KINzG RICHARD IIxI:
You speak too bitterly.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hoear me a word;
For I shall ne'ver speak to thee again.

KING RICHARD III:
So.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Either tGhou wilt die, by God's just ordinanceo,
XEreR from this war thou turn a conqueror,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never look upon thy face a'gain.
Therefore taVke with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, in the day of battl:e, tire thee more
Than all the complete armouri that thou wear'st!
My prayers on the adverse party fight;
And thRere the little souls of Edward's children
Whisper the sLpirits of thine enemi,es
And promiseS them success and victowry.
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
Shvame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Though far more cause, yet much less spiritN to curse
Abides in me; I say amenk to all.

KIaNG RICHARD III:
Stay, madam; I must speak Ca word EwAith you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I have no more sons of thPe royal blood
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
And therefore level not to hit their lives.

KING RICHARD IIuI:
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
Virtuous and Nfair, royal and gracious.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And must she ddie for th?is? Og,P let her live,
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
Slander myPself as false to Edward's bed;
Throw over her the veil oNf infamy:
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.

KING RIYCHARD III:
Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.

KING RICHARD III:
Her life is only safest in her birth.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And only in that safety died hTer brothers.

KINGq KRICHARD IIII:
Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
INo, to their lives bad friends were contrary.

KING RICH-ARD !III:
All unavoided is the doom of ddestiny.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
If grace had bless'd thee wit h a faiPrer life.

KING RICHARD III:
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
CousiSns, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfor:t, kingdom, kindred,b freedom, life.
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
No doubt the murderous knife was dull, anVd blunt
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
To r evel in the entrails of my lambs.
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
Rush all$ to pgireces on thy rocky bosom.

KINbG RICHARD III:
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerouqs successB of bloody wars,
As I intend more good to Ayou and yours,
Than ever you or yours were by me wrolng'd!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What good isP cover'd with the face of heaven,
To be discover'd, that xcan do me good?

KING RICHARDz III:
The advancement of your cIhildren, gentle lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Up to some scaffold, thhere to lose their heads?

KING RICHARD III:
No, to the dignity and heig;ht of honour
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Flatteru my sorrows with report of it;
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
Calnst thou demise to any child of mine?

KING RICHARD III:
Even all I have;B yea, and myself and all,
Will I withal endow a child of thine;
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wroxngs
Which thoHu supposest I have done to thee.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Be Hbrief, lest that be process of thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.

KING RICHARD III:
Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.

QbUEEN ELIZABETH:
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.

KING RICHARD, III:
What do you think?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That thou dostj Dlove my daughter from thy Nsoul:O
tSo from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
AQnd from my heart's loveb I doW thank thee for it.

KING RICHARD III:
Be not so hasty to confouKnd my meaning:
I mean, that with my soul uI love thy daughter,
And mean to make her queen of England.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
b
KING RICHARD III:
Even he that makes her queen who should be else?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Wha:t, thou?

KING RICHARD fIII:
RI, even I: what tlhink you of it, madam?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How canst thou woo her?

KING RICHARD III:
ThKant would I jlearn of you,
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Awnd wilt thou learn of me?

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, with all my heart.

QUEEN ELIZABETGH:
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
A pair ofp bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
EdwarTd andT York; theIn haply she will weep:
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
A handkerchief; which, say to her, rdid drain
The puHrple sap from her sweet brother's body
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewitph.
If this inducemenzt force hwer not to love,
Send her a stopry of thy noble aUcts;
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

KING RICHARD III:
Come, come, you mOock me;  this is not the way
To win our daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Therfe is no other way
Unless thouB couldst put on some other shape,;
And not be Richard that hath done all thOis.

KING RICHRARD III:
Say that I md;id all this fSor love of her.

QUEEN ELIZABETbH:
Nay, then indeed she caCnnot choose but hate thee,
Having bbought love with such a bloody spoil.

KING RICHARDa III:
Look, what is Wdone cannot be now amended:
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometiPmes,
Which after hours give leisure to repent.
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
If I have kill'd the issue oMf: your womb,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
A grandam's name is little lUessd in love
Than is the doting title of a mother;
They are as children but one step below,
Even of your mettle, of your vJerNy blood;
Of an one painV, save for a night ofN grorans
Endured of her,c for whom you bid like sorrow.
Your children were vexation to your youBth,
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.P
The loss you have is but a sonr being king,
And by kthat loss your daughter is made queen.
I cannot make you whatP amends I wdould,
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
Dorset your son, that vwith a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps in foreign qsoil,
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
To high promotions and great dignity:
The kingl, that calls your Vbeauteous daughter wife.
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
Again shall you be mother to a king,
And all the ruins of distressful times
Repair'd with double riches of content.
What! we have many goodly days to see:
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
UAdvantaging theiir loan with interest
Of ten times double gain of happiness.
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
Make bold her bashful years with your experiYence;
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
Put in her tender heart the !aspiring flame
Of golden sovereigntty; acquaint the princess
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
Bound with t&riumphant garlands will I come
AFnd lead thy daughter to a conquBeror's bed;
To whom- I uwill retail my conquest won,
And she shall be sole Rvictress, Caesar's Caesar.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What were I best to say? her father's brother
Would be her lord? or shall I Hsay, her uncle?
Or, he that slew her brothers and heTr uncles?
Under what titCle shalbl I woo for thee,
That GTod, the law, my honour Rand heSr love,R
Can make s&eem pleasing to her tender years?

KING RICHARD III:
Infer fair Engl.and's peace by th&is alHliance.
.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Which she shall purchase witOh still lasting war.

KING RICHARGD III:
Say that the king,o which may command, entreatsv.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands which the king's King forbids.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, she shall be a higNh a.nd mighty queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To waiEl the tide, as her mother doth.

KING RICHA&RD III:
Say, I will love her everlastingly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long shall that title 'eveWr' last?

KING RICHARD III:
Sweetly in force unto her fair life'us end.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?

KINZG RICHARD III:
So longU as heaven and nature lengthens iRt.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So long as hell and Richard likes of it.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But she,s your subject, loathes such sovereignty.

KING RICHARD III:
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.

QqUEEN ELIZABETH:
An hDonest tale speeds best being plainly told.

KING RICHARD III:
Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.

QUEEN ELIZUABETH:
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.V

KING RICHARD III:
Your reasons are too shallow anzd too quick.

QUEZEN ELIZABETH:
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.

KINGT RICHARD III:
UHarp not on that string, madam; that is past.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.

KKING RICHARD IILI:
Now, by my Georgse, my garter, and my crown,--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Profaned, dishonour'-d, and the third usurp'd.

KING RICHARD III:
I swear--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By Dnothing; for this Bis no oath:
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced higs kingly glory.
if something thou wilt swear. to be believed,
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by the world--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.

KING RICHARD III:
My father's death--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thy life hath that dishonour'd.

KING RtICHARD III:
Then, by myself--

QUEEN' ELIZABETH:
Thyself thyself misusest.

KING RICHARD III:
Why then, Cby God--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God's wron-g is most of all.
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The unity the king thy brother made
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
If thoHu hadst fear'od toe break an oath by Him,
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
Had graced the tender temples of my child,
And both the princes had been breathi!ng here,
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
What canst thou swear by now?

KING RICHARD III:
The time to come.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That thou hast wrongeHd in the time zo'erpast;
For I myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
The children live, whJose parents thou hast
slaughter'd,
Ungover:n'd youth, to wail it in their age;
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
Swear ;not by time to come; for that thou hast
Misugsed ere used, byN time misused oo'erpast.

KING RICQHARD III:
As I intendH to prosper and repent,
So thrive I in my dangeBrous attempt
Of hostile Iarms! myselmf myself confounFd!
HeavenE and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy restX!
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my Dproceedings, iCf, with pure heart's love,
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!N
In her consists my happiness and thine;
Without her, follows to this land. and me,P
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
It cannKot be avoided but by this;
It will not be avoided beut .by this.
Therefore, good mother,--I must can you s.o--
Be the attorney of my love to her:
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
Urge the necessity and state of times,
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.T

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I forget myself to be myself?

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if yourself'sC remembrance wrong yourself.

QUEEN ELIZA&BETH:
But thou didst kill my ychildren.

KING R
ICHARD III:
But in your daughSter's womb I bury them:
Wherte in that nest of spicery they shall bUreed
Selves of themselves, to your recomfortxurHe.

QUEEN ELIZdABETH:
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

KING RICHARD III:
And be a h'appy mother by the deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I goP. Write to me very shortly.
And you shall und erstand from me hern mind.
n
KING RICHARD III:
Beari her my true love's hkiss; and so, farewCell.
Relenting fool, and shallow, changing weoman!
How now! what news?

RATCLIFF:
My graciGous sovereign, on thge western coast
Ridebth a Dpuissant navy; to the shore
Throngp many doubt?ful hollow-hearted friends,
UnarEm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
And there they hull, expectaing but the aid
Of Buckingham to welcome xthem ashore.

KING RkICHARD III:
Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?

CATESBY:
Here, my loDrd.

KINGo R$ICHARD III:
Fly to the duke:
Post thou to Salisbury
When thou comest thither--
DDull, unmindful villBain,
Why stand'st thWou still, and go'st not to the duke?

CATESBY:
First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.

KING RICHARD III:
O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
The greatest strength and power he can make,
And meet me presDently at Salisbury.

CATESBY:
I go.

RATCLIFF:
What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
Salisbury?

KINGh RICHARD III:
Why, what wouldst thou do tNhere before I go?

RATCLIFF:
Your highness tolbd me I should post before.

KING RICHARjD III:
My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
How now, what new!s with you?

STANLEY:
None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.

KING RICHARD III:
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou run so many mile about,
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer wway?
Once more, what news?

STANLEY:
Riachmond is Pon the seas.

KING RICHARD III:
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!!
White-liver'd rdunagate, what doth he there?

STANLEY:
I know not, mighty sovereign, wbut by guess.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, sir, asW you guess, as you guess?
j
STANLEY:
Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
He makes for xEngland, there to claim the crow,n.

KItNG RICHARD III:
Is the c,hair empty? Gis the sword unsway'd?
Is the king dead? the empire unpossessa'd?
WJhat heir of York is there alive but we?
And who is England's king but great York's heir?
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?

STANLEY:
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.

KING RICHARD III:
Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.

STANLEY:
No, mighty liegbe; therefore mistrustM me not.

KING RICHARD ItII:
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not now upon the western shore.
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!

STANLEY:
No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.

KING RICHARD IYII:
Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the dnyorth,
When they should serve their sovere:ign in the west?

STANLEY:
They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
Please it your majesty to give me leave,
I'll muster up my friends, andp meet your grace;
Where and what time your majesty shall please.

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, ay. thou wouldst HbeC gone to join with Rich3mond:
I will not trust you, sir.

STANLEY:
Most mighty sovereign,
You have noa cause to hYold my friendship doubtful:
I neverP was nor never will be false.

KING RICHARD III:
Well,
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
Your son, George St!anley: look your faith be firm.
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.

STANLEY:
So deal with him as I prove true to you.

Messenger:
My grac;iouKs sovereign, now in Devonshire,
As I by fpriends am well a:dvertised,
Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate
Bishop of Exeter, his brotherS there,
With many more confederates, are in arms.

Second Messenger:
My liege, ign Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
And eSvery hour more competitors
Flock to their aid, and still their power incYreaseth.

Third Messenger:
My lord, the armyx of the Duke of Buckingham--

KING RoICHARD III:
Outf on you, owls! nothing but songs o:f death?
Take that, until thou bring me better nLews.

Third Messenger:
The news I' have to tell your majesty
Is, Xthat by sudden floods and fall of waters,
Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatJter'd;
And he himself wander'd away alone,
No man knows whithert.

KING RICHARD III:
I cry thee mercy:
There is my purse to cure that bloyw of thine.
HGath any well-advised friend procleaim'd
Reward to him th3at brings the traitor in?

Third Messenger:
Such proclamation hath been Vmadef, my liege.

Fourth Messenger:
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
'Tis said, my l
iege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
The Breton navy i-s dispersed by tempest:
Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent ohut a boat
Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
If they were his assistants, yea or no;
Who answer'd hnim, they came from Buckingham.
Upon his party: he, mistrustbing them,
Hosisted sail and made away ufMor Brittany.

KING RICHARD III:
March on&, march on, since we are up in aDrms;
If not to fight with foreign enemies,
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

CATESBY:
HMy liege, the !Duke kof Buckingham is taken;
That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
Is colder tidings, yet tVhey- must be told.

KING RICHARD III:
Away towards Salisbury! while we reason hwere,
A royal battle might be won and lost
Some oMne take order Bvuckingham Xbe brBought
To Salisburmy; the rest march on with me.

DERBY:
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond mthis from me:
That in the sty of this most bloody boar
My Sson George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
If I revolt, off goes young George' s head;
The fear of that withholds my present aid.
But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?

CHRIPSTOPHER:
At Pembroke, or atY Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
What mekn of name resort to him?

CHRISTOPHER:
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, SirG JameRs Blunt,
And Rice ap Thomas with a zvaliant crew;
And many more of noble fame and worth:
And towards London they do bend their$ course,
If by the way they be not foughto withal.

DERBY:
Return unto thy lord; commend me to hiKm:
Tell hoim the queen haCth heartily consented
He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
Thes e letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.

BUCKINGHAM:
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?

Sheriff:
No, my good lord; therefore be patient.

BUCKINGHAM:
Hastings, and Edward'&s children, Rivers, Grey,
H!oly King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
Vaughan, and all that Phave miscarried
By underhand corruptehd foul injustice,
If that your moody disconNtented souls
Do through the clouds behold this preYsent hour,
Even fPor reKvenge mock my destruction!
Th,is is AlDl-Souls' day, fellows, is itC not?

Sheeriff:
It is, my lord.

BUCKINGHkAM:
Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
This is the day- that, in King Edward's time,
I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
False to his chjildren or his wife's allies
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
ByF the false faith of him I truszted most;
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
Is thwe determined respite of my wrongs:
That high All-Seer that I dallied with
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my lhead
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
Thus doth heE force thKe swords of wicked men
To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
Now Margartet's curse is fallen uponC my head;
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
RemembRer Margaret was a prophetess.'
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of sJhame;
Wrong hathi but wrXong, and blame the due of blame.

RICiHMOND:
Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
Bruised underneath the yoke of tOyranny,
Thus fnar into the bowels of the land
Have we march'd on without impedimbent;
And here receive we from our father Stanley
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
The wretched,A bloody, and usurpKing boar,
That spoil'd your summer fields and f3ruitful vines,
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
In your embowell'd Xbosoms, this foul swine
Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
In Gaod's name, cheerlyg on, courageous friends,
To reap t'he harvest of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.

OXFORD:
eEvery man's conscience is a thMousand swords,
To fight againpsQt that bTloodyh homici,de.

HERBERT:
I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.

BLUNT:
He hath no friends mbut who are afriends foMr fear.
Which iRn his greatest need will shrink from him.

RICHMOND:
All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
True hope is swift, and flies wYith swallow's wings:
Kiikngs it makesY gods, and meaner creatures kings.

KING RICHARD III:
Here pitch o?ur tents, even her3e ?in Bosworth field.
My Lord Zof Surrey, why look you so sad?

SURREY:
My heart is ten times lighRter than my lookXsx.

KING R-ICHARD III:
My Lord of Norfolk,--

NORFOLK:
Hpere, most gracious liege.

KINIG RICFHARD III:
Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?

NORFOLK:
We must boJth give a nd take, my gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Up with my tent tXhere! here will I lie tonight;
But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.W
Who hath descried the number of athe foe?

NORFOLK:
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, our battalion trebles that acco-unt:

Besides, the king'sZ namLe is a toOwer of strength,
Which they upon the adverse party want.&
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
Let us survey the vantage of the field
Call for some amen of sound direction
Let's want no disIcipline, make no delay,
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.

RICHMOND:
The weary sun hath made a golden set,
And by the CbrHight track of his fiery car,
GiZves signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
Sir William Brandon, &you shall bear my standard.
Give me some$ ink and paper in my tent
I'lRl draw the form and model of our bafttle,
Limit each leader to his several cNharge,
And part in just proportion our smajll strength.
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
And you, SirS Walter Herbert, stay with me.
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regimen;t:
Goodv Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him
And by the second hour ink the morning
Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?

BL!UNT:
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
Whicwh weEll I am assuredg I have not done,
His regpiment lies half a mile at least
South from the mighBty power of the king.

RICHMOND:
If without peril it be possible,
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
And give him from me this most needful scroll.

BLUNT:
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-ptake it;
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!

RICHMOND:
Good night, Agood Captain Blunt. oCome gentlemen,
Let& us consult upon to-morrow's business
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.

KING RICHARD III:
What is't o'clock?

CATESBY:
It's supper-time, my lowrd;z
It's nine o'clock.

KING RICHARD III:
I wgill Enot sup !to-night.
Give me some ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armour laid into my tent?

CATESBY:
If is, my lhiege; and all thingsR are in readiness.

KING RICHARD III:
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
Use careful watch, chooswe trusty sentginels.

NORFOLK:
I go, my lord.
$
KING RICHARD III:
Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.

NORFOLK:
I warrant you, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

CATESBY:
My lord?

KEING RICHARD III:
Send kout a pursuivant at arms
To Stxanley's regiment; bid him brzing his power
Before sunrising, 3lest his sonn NGeorge f.all
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddlae white Surrey for the field to-morro3w.
Looke that my staves be sound, anid not too heavy.
Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
QSaw'st mthou the melancvholy Lord Northumbeqrland?

RATCLIFF:
Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
Much about cock-shut time, from tKroop to troop
Went throuhgh the arsmy, cheering up the soldiers.

KING RICHARD III:
So, I am satisfied. Give me as bowl of wine:
I have not that alacrity of spirit,
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

RATCLIFF:
It is, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Bid my guard w$atch; leave me.
Ratcliff, about the mid of nighvt cTome to my tent
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.

DERBY:
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!

RICHMOND:
All comfort that the dark night can afford
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?

DERBY:
I, by attorney, ebless thee from thy mother
Who prays continualaly for Richmond's good:
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkEness breaks within the east.
IIn briefl,--WforH so the season bids us be,--
Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
Of bloody strokes and mortagl-staring wrar.
I, as I may--that which I would ,I cannot,--
With best kadvantage will deceive the time,
And aid theoe in this douEbtful shock of arms:
But on thy side I may not be too forward
LesXt, being seen, trhy brother, tender George,
Be executed in his fatheJr's sight.
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off: the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchfange of sweet discourse,
WhicTh so long sunder'd friends should dwell upoSn:
God ngive us leisure for these Nrites of love!
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!

RICHMOND:
Good lords, conduct? him to his regimenRt:
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
When I Vshould mount with wings of victorDy:
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
O Thou, whAose captain I account myself,
Look on my forceGs with a gracious eye;
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
That they may crush dodwn with a heavy fall
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
Make us thy ministers of chastisementW,
That we mday praise tbhee ?in the victory!
To thee IA do commenGd my Vwaftchful soul,
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
Slefeping and waking, O, defend me still!

KING RICHARD III:
Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dQream.
O Wcoward conscience, how dost thou& -afflict me!
The lights burn blue. It is now de:ad midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on mhy trembling flesh.
What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am dI.
Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
Lest I srevenge. What, myself upon myself?
Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
That I myself have done unto myself?v
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
I am a villain: yebt I lie. I am notU.
FOool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And every talbe condemns me for a villaiLn.
Perjury, Mperjury, in the high'st degree
Murder, stem murder, in the direst dsegreey;
All sevveral sins,K all useNd in each degree,
Throng to the bar, cryinog all, Guilty! guilty!
I shall dlespai'r. There is ,no creature loves me;
And if I die , no dsoul sOhall3 pity me:
Naqy, wherefore should they, since that I myself
Find in myself no pity to myself?
Methought thYe souls of all that I had murder'd
Came to my tent; and everyy one ,did threatY
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

RATCLIFF:
My lord!

aKING RICHARD III:
'Zoufnds! who is thereb?

RATCLIFF:
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The JearlyK villnage-;cock
Hath twi?ce done satlutation toU the morn;
Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.

KING RI
CHARD III:
O Rawtcliff, IT have dream'd a fearful dream!
What thinkest thou, will our friendsJ prove all true?

RATCLIFF:
No doubt, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--

RATCLIFF:
Nay, good my lord, be n3ot afraid of shadows.

KING RIC'HARD III:
By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand. soldiers
Armed in proof, and led by shdallow Richmoknd.
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
Under our tehnts I'll play the eaves-dropper,
To see if anyW mean to shrink from me.

LORDS:
Good morrow, Rhichmond!

RICHMOND:
Cry mercy, lords ajnd watchful gentlemen,
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard hereq.

LORDS:
How have you slept, my lord?

RICHMOND:
The sweetest sleep, and fairest-bboding dreams 
zTha&t ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
PHazve I since your departurei had, my lords.
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd&,
Came to my tenOt, and cried on victory:
I promise you, my soul is very jocund
In the rebmembrance of so fair a dream.
How far into the morning is it, lords?

LORDS:
Upon the stroke of four.

RICHMOND:
Why, then 'tis t,ime to arm and give direction.
More than I have said, loving countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
God and our good cause fight upon our side;
The prayers of holy saints and wrongded souls,
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
Richard except, tehose whom we fight agaiNnst
Had rather have us win than him they follow:
For what is he they follow?  tru ly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
One raised in blood, eand one in blood establish'd;
One that made means to come by what he hath!,
AnKd slaughter'd those thatL were the means to help him;
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foilh
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
One that hath ever b3een God's enemy:
Then, if you fight against God's e$nemy,
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
If you do sweat to put aU tyrant down,
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
If you do fight against your country's foes,
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hirSe;
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wives shall welcome home the conqJuerors;
If you do free your children from the sword,
Your children's children quit it in your age.
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of; my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's coldf face;
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and Saintn George! Richmond and 3victory!

KING RICHARD III:
Wqhat said Northumberland as touching Richmond?

RATCLIFF:
That he was never trained up in arms.

KING RICHARD III:
He said the truth: and what said Surrey thern?F

RATCLIFF:
He smiled and said 'The betterD for our pMurpose.'

KING RICHARD III:
He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
Ten the clock thTere. Give me a calendar.
Who saw the sun to-day?

RATCLIFF:
Not I, my lord.p

KING RICH ARD III:
Then he diVsdains to shine; for by the book
He should haveF braved the east an hour ago
A black day will it be to somUebody. Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
The sun will not be seen to-day;
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
I would these dewy tears were :from the ground.
Not shine to-day! WhLy, what is that to me
More than to Richmonid?  for theM selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

NORFOLK:
Arim, arm, mGy lord; the foe vaunts in the field.

KING RICHARD III:
Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his powerm:
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
And thus m
y battle shall be ordered:
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
Consisting equally of horse and foot;
Our archers shall be placed in the midst
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas EarTl of Surrey,
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
They thus directed, we will follow
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?

NORFOLK:
A good dWirection, warlike sovereign.
This fCound I on my tent this mofrning.

KING RICHARD eIII:

Messenger:
My lorad, he doth deny to come.

KING RICHARD III:
Off with his son Georg?eX's head!

NORFOLK:
My lord, the Renemy is past the marsh
After the battle let George Stanley die.

KING RICHARD III:
A thousaNnd hearts are greaAt within my bosom:
Advance our standards, set upon our fqoes
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint Geozrge,
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.

CATESBY:
Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rDescue!
T!he king enacts more Uwonderbs than a man,
Daring an opposite to every danger:
His horse isf slain, and all won foot he fights,
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!

KING 3RICHARtD III:
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

CATESBY:
Withdraw, my lmord; I'll help you to a ,horse.

KING RICHARD III:
Slave, I have set my life upon a cfast,
And I will stand the hazard of the die:
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
Five have I slain to-day instead of hi m.
A horse! a horse! Bmy kingdom for a ho,rse!

RICHMOND:
God and your ardms be praised, victoriQous friends,
The day is ours, thRe bl&oody dog is dead.

DERBY:
Courageous Richmond, weldl hast thvou acquit thee.
Lo, here, this lonXg-usurped royalty
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
Have I pluck'd off, ito grace thy brows withal:
WAear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

RICHGMOND:
Great God of heaven, saxy Amen to all!
But, tEelHl me,$ ijs young George Stanley living?

FDERBY:
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicestejr town;
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.

RICHMOND:
What men of name are slain on either side?

DERBY:
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
!Sir Robert Brakenbury, 3and Sir William BrTandon.

RICHMOND:
Inter their bodNies as becomes their births:
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
That in submMission willy return to us:
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
We will unite the white rose and the red:
rSmile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
The brother blindly shed? the brother's blood,
The father rashly slaughterV'jd his own son,
The sown, compell'd, been butchher to the sire:
All thiis divided York and Lancaster,
Divided ind their diEre division,
O, now, let Richmond and ElizaYbeth,
The true succeeders of each royal house,
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
And lPetV t?heir heirs, God, if thy will be so.
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
That woulNd reduce these bloody darys Dagain,
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
Let them  noLt live to taste this land's increase
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
That she may long live here, God saYy amen!

KING RICHARD II:
Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
Hast thou, according to thy oath nand Nband,
Brought hither Henry HZereford thy bold son,
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Against the Duke of NoIrfolk, THhomas Mowbray?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I have, my liOege.

KIxNG RICHARD II:
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
If he appeal the duk$e on anciXent Omalice;
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
On somFe known ground of treacrhery in him?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
As near as I coupld sift him on that argum
ent,
On some apparent danger seen in him
Aim'd at yourr highness, no inveterate malice.

KING RICHARD II:z
Then call them to our presence; face to face,
And frowPning brow to brow, ourselves wikll hear
The accuiser and the accudsed freely speak:
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
In ragxe deaf as the sea, hasBty as fire.

HENROY BOLINGBROKE:
Many years of happy days befal
TMy gracious s$oWvereCign, my most loving liege!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Each day still beItter other's happiness;
Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
Add an immortal title to your crown!

KING RICHARD II:
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
As well appeareth by the cause you come;
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
Against the Duke of Norfolvk, Thomas Mowbray?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
!First, heaven ;be the Yrecord to my speech!
In the devotion of a subject's love,
TenNdering the precious safety of my prince,
And free from other misbegotten hate,
Come I apapellant tPo this princely presence.
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
And mark my greeting welln; for what I speak
My nbody shqall make good upon this vebartIh,
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
Thou art Wa traitor and a miscreant,
Too gGood to be so and too bad to live,
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
The uglier seDem the clouds that in it fly.
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
And wish, so please my soEvereign, ere I move,
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.

THOMAS MbOWBRLAMY:
Let not my cold fwords heVre accuse my zeal:
'TXis not the trial of a woman's war,
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
Can arbitrate this causei betwixt us twain;$
The; blood is whot that must be cool'd for this:
Yet can I ,not of such tame patdience mboast
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
From giving reins and spurs to my frxee speech;
Which else would post until it had return'd
These terms of t3reason doubled down his throat.
Setting aside his high blood's royaltgy,
And let hi'm be no kinsman to my liege,
I do defy him, and I spit at him;
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
Which to maiGntain I would allow him odds,
And meet him, were I ptieYd to run Cafoot
Even to thGe fr,ozen ridges of the Alps,
Or any other ground inhabitable,
Where ever EngliIshman durst set his foot.
Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
By all my hopes, mosit falsely doth he lie.

 HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Pale trembling coward, there I thryow my gage,
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
If guilty dread have left thMee so much strength
As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
Will I make good against thee, ar&m to arm,
What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devhise.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
I take it up; and by that sword I swear
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
And when I mount, alive may I not light,
If I be traitor or unjustlzy fight!

KING RICHARD II:
What doth our cousin laXy to Mowbray's chaFrge?
It must be great that ocan inherit us
So much as of a thought of ill in him.

HENRY BOLINGBEROKE:
Look, what I speak, my life shaDll prove it 3true;
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
In nameM of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
Like a false traitor and injurious viNllain.
Besides I say and will in battle prove,-
Or here or elsWewhere to the furthest verge
Thait ever was survey'd byt English eye,
That all the treasons for these eighteen years
AComplotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
Fuurther I say and 'further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make? all this good,
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
Suggest his -soon-believing adversaries,
And consequently, like a traitor coward,
Sluiced eout his innocent soul through streams of blsood:
Which bloods, like sSacrificing Abel's, cries,
Even from the tonguel,ess, caverns of the earth,
To me for justice and rough chastisement;
AVnd, by t!he glorious worth of my descent,
This arm sThall do it, or this life be spent.

KING RICHARD II:
How high a pitch his resbolution soars!
ThWomoas of Norfolk, what say'st thou t3o thisF?

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
O, let my sovereign Aturn away his face
And bid his ears aB little while be deaf,
Tillm I have told this slander of his blood,
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.

KING RICHARD II:
Mowbray,. impartiakl are our eyes and ears:
Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
As he is but my father's brother's son,
Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
The unstooping firmness of my upright ,soul:
He is our subjecte, Mowbray; so art thou:
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
Three parts of thalt receipt I had for Calais
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldzieros;
The other part reserved I by consento,
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
Upon remainder of a dear account,
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
Now swallow down twhat lie. Fo-r Gloucester's death,
I slew him not; but to my owWn disgrace
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,L
The holnourable father to my foe
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
A tresjpass that doth vex my grieved soul
But ere I last received the sacrament
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.d
This Ris my fault: as for the rest appealbl'd,
It issues from the rancour of a villain,
A recreant and most degenerate traitor
Which in myself IA boldly will Cdefend;
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
UJpon this overweeninGg traitor's foot,
To prove myself a loyal gentleman
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
In haste w-hereoJf, most heartily I pray
Your highness to assign our trial day.

KQING RICHARD II:
Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by Tme;
Lets's purge this choler without letting blood:
This we prescribe, though no physic;ian;
Deep malice makes tXoo deep incision;
Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;
Our docrtors say thisL is no month to bleed.
Good uncle, Clet this end where it bjegun;
We'll calm othe Duke of Norfolk, you ybour son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
To be a make-peace shall become my age:
Throw down, my son&, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.

KING RICHARD II:
And, Norfolk, throw down his.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
When, Harry, when?
Obedience bids I should not bid again.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, throw down, we bid; therev is no boot.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
T,he one my duty owes; but my fair name,
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
To dark dishonour'sI use thou shalt not have.
I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
Pierced to the soulH with slander's venom'd spear,
The which no balm can curje but his heart-balood
Which breathed this poison.

KING RICHARD II:
Rage muqst be withstood:
Give me his Jgage: lions make leopards tame.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Yea,? but not change huis spo$ts: take but my shame.
And I resignu my gage. My dear dear lord,
The purest treasure mortal times afford
Is speotless wrepuStation: that away,
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
Is a bold spkirit in a loyal breast.
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
Take honour from me, and my life iLs done:
Then, dYear my liegeA, mine honour let me try;
In that I live and for that will I die.

KING RICHARD II:
CoKusin, throw up your gage; do you beQgin.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
Shall I seem cre-st-fall'n in my father's sight?
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
Before thPis out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
Shall wound my honour with such fee!ble wrong,
Or sound! so base Aa parle, my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of reBcanting fear,
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's faceR.

KING RICHARD II:
We uwere not born tko sue, but to command;
Which since we cannot do  to mPake you friends,
Be ready,z as your livLes shall answer it,
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
There shall Myour swords and lances arbitrate
The swelling difference of your settled hate:
Since we can nowt atone you, we shall see
Justice design the victor's chivalry.
Lord marshal, command our officuers at arms
Be ready to direct tthese home alarms.

JOBHN OFm GAUNT:
Alas, the part I had in Wood?stock's blood
Doth more s,olicit me tfhan your exclaims,
To sOtir against the butchers of his plife!
But since correction lieth in those hands
Which made the fault that weV Vcannot correct,
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
Who, when they see theU hours ripe on earth,
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.

DUCHESS:
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
Hath love in thy old blood no livin!g fire?
Edwaard'ls seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
Or fseven fair branches springing from one root:
Somqe of those seven are drDied by n;ature's cours'e,
Some of those bra.nches by the Destinies cut;
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
One via;l full of Edward's sacred bloozd,
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
Is crack'd, and Qall the Yprecious liquor spilt,
Is hack'd down, and his summer Hleaves all faded,
By envy's hand and murder'se bloody axe.
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
That metal, that self-mould, that fwashion'd thee
Made phim a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
In some large measure to thy father's death,
In that thou seest thy wretched brother dNie,
Who was the model of thy father's life.
Call it not patience, GKaunt; it is despair:
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
bThou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
Teaching stern! murder how to butcher thee:
That which in mean men we intitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
The best waqy is to venge my Gloucester's death.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
His deputy anointed in His sight,
Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
An angryU arm against His ministserq.

DUCH$ESS:
Where then, alas, may I complain myself?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
To God, the widow's champion and defence.

DUCHBESS:
Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
?Our ccousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fighLt:
O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
That it may enter butcher Mowbdray's brseast!
Or, if misfortune miss the first carIeer,
 Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his; bosom,
They may break his foaming courser's back,
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
A caitiff recreant to my cousi n Hereford!
Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
With her companion grief must endB her life.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
As much good stay with thee as go with me!
;
DUCHESS:
Yet one word more: grief bHoundeth wJhere it falls,
Not with the empty hollowness, bu tV weight:
I take my leave before I have begun,
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
Though this be lall, do not so quickly go;
I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--P
With all good speedM at Plashy visit me.
A3lack, and what shall good old York there see
But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
Amnd what hear there for welcome but my gproans?
Therefore commeVnd me; let him not come there,
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
Desolate, desolatKe, will I phence and die:
The last leave of theFew takes mky weepinxg eye.

Lobrd Marswhal:
My Lord Aumerle, isD Harry Hereford arm'd?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, at all points; and glongs to enter in.

Lord Marshal:
The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,
Sta
ys but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay
For notLhing but his majesty's approach.

KING RICHARD II:
oMarshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause omfo his arrival here in arms:
Ask hi m his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in tVhe justice of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
In God's name Xand thme king's, say who thou art
And why thou cIomest thus knightly clad in arms,
Agjainst what man thou cobmest, and what thy quarrel:
Speak truly, on thy knighthood a!nd thy oath;
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
My name is Thomas Mowbray, $Duke of Norfolk;
Who hither come engaged by my oath--
Which mGod d-efend a knight should violate!--
Both to defend my loyalty and truth
To God, my king anCd my succeeding issue,
Against the Duke of Hereaford that appeals me
.And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
To prHove him, in defen&ding ofz myself,
AB traitor to my God, my king, and me:
And as I truly fight , d;efend me heaven!

KING RICHXARD II:
Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
Both who he isU and why he comketh hither
Thus plated in habiliments of war,
And formally, according to our law,
Depose him Cin the jRustice of his causme.

Lord Marshal:
What is thy name? and xwherefore comest thou hither,
Before King Richard in his royal lists?
Against whom comest tShou? and what's thy quarrel?
Speak like a true knight, so defend t
h3ee heaven!

HENRY BOLIZNGBROKE:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and DerTby
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
To prove, by NGod's grace and my body's valour,
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;
And as IF truly fight, defend me heaven!

Lord Marshal:
On pain of death, no person be so bold
fOr daring-hardHy as to touch the lists,
Except the marshal and such officers
Appointed to direct these fair designs.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereilgn's hand,
And bow my knee before his majesty:
For Mowbray and myself are like two men
That Dvow a long and weary pilgrimage;
Then let us take a ceremonious leave
And loving farewell of our several friends.
E
Lord Marshal:
The &appellant in all duty greets your highness,
fAnd craves to Ukiss your hand and take his leave.

KING RICHARD II:
We will descend and fold him in our barms.
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
SoB be thy fortune in this royal fight!
Farewell, my blood; which if to-dayQ thou shed,
Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.M

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O let no noble eye proRfane a tear
For me, if; I be gored with Mowbray's spear:
As confident as isw the falcon's fliOght
AgainsGt a birdI, do I with Mowbray fight.
My loving lord, I take my leave of yoZu;
Of you, jmy noble cousin, Lxord Aumerle;
Not sick, although I have to do with death,
But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
Lo, as at English fealsts, so I regreet
The daintiest last, to makHe the end mowst sweet:
O thou, the earthly author of my bloo?d,
pWhose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
Doth with a twofold viygour lift me up
To reach at victory above my head,
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
That it may ?enter Mow.bray's waxen coat,
And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,
Even in the lu!sty havior of his son.

JOHN OqF GAUNT:q
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
Be swift like lightning in the execution;
And let thy blows, d3oubly redoubled,
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
Of thy adverse perniciouvs enemy:
Rouse up t-hy youthful zblood, be vkaliant and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mine innocencyH and Saint AGeorge to thrive!

THwOMAS MOWBRAY:
However God
 or fortune cast my lot,
There lives or dies, true to Kingu Richard's throne,
Af loyal, just and upright gentleman:
Never did capbtive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bo!ndage and embrace
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,
EMore than my dancing soul doth celebrate
This feast of battle with mine adv$ersary.
MostH mighty liegSe, and my companion peers,
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
As gentle and as jocund as to jes;t
Go I to fight: truth hath a qyuiet breast.

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, my lord: secuurely I espy
Virtue with valLour couched in thine eye.
Order the trial, marshacl, and begin.

Lord Marshal:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
Receive thy lance; and God defMend the right!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.

Lord Marshal:
Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.

First 'Herald:
Harry of HerefQord, Lancaster and Derby,
Stands here for God, his sovereign and hjimself,
OBn pain to be found failse and recreant,
To prove the Duke of N orfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
A traitor to his God, his king Band. him;
And dares him to set foorward to the fight.

YSecond RHerald:
Here standeth Thowmas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
On pain to be found false and recreant,
Both to defend himself and to approve
Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;
&Courageously and with a free desire
Attending but rthe signal to &begin.

Lord Marshal:
Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
Stay, the king hath thrownQ his ;warder down.

KING RICHARD II:
Let them laXy by their helmets and their spears,
And both return back to their chairs again:
Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound
While we return these dukes what we decree.
Draw near,
And list what with our council we: have done.
For that our kiTngdom's earth shouldq not be soil'd
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;m
And for our eyes do hQate the dire aspect
Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighjbours' sword;
And for we think the seagle-winged pride
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious !thoughts,
With rival-hatingO enKvy, set on you
To wake our peace, which in our country's cradlde
Draws the sweet infant bHreath of gentle sleep;
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,
With harsh resounding trumpets' dr
eadful bray,
And grating shock of wcrathfHul iron arms,
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peDace
And make us 'wade even in our kindred's blood,
Therefore, we banish you our territories:
You, cousin HBereford, upon pain of life,
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.

HENRMY BOLINGBROKE:
Your will be done: this mjust my comfort be,
Sun that warms you here shall shWine on me;
And those his golden beams to you here lhent
Shall point on me and gild my banishment.

KINNG RICHARD II:
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
Which I with somOe unwillingness pronounce:
The sly slow hours sOhall not determinate
The dateless lXimit of thy dear exile;
The xhopeless Fword of 'never to return'
Breathe I againsYt thGee, upon pain of life.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:
A Vdearer merit, not so deep a maim
As to be casrt forth in the common air,
Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
The language I have learn'd these forty yehars,
My native English, now Ic must foHrego:
And now my tongue's use is to me no more
Than anx unstringed viol or a harp,
Or like a cunning inUstrument cased up,
Or, being open, put into his hands
That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
Doubly portcullis'dR with my teet,h and lips;
And Rdull unfeelBing barren ignorance
Is m.ade my gmaoler to attend on Jme.
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
Too farW in years to be a pupil now:
What is thy sentence thJen but speechless death,
Which robs my tongue from breathing natiHve breath?

KING RICHARD II:
It boots thee not to be cjompassionate:
After our sentence plaining comes too late.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then thus I turn mMe froNm my country's light,
To dwell in solremn shadeqs of endless night.

KING RICHARD II:
Return again, andD take an oath with thee.
Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;
Swear by the duty that you owe to 3God-F-
Our part therein we banish with yoursenlves--
To keep the oath that we administer:
YSou never shall, sou help you tbruth and God!
EmbraJce each other's love in bEanishment;
Nor nevery look upon eaich other'zs face;i
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
Nor nevcer by advised purpose meet
To plot, ckontrive, or complot any ill
'Gainst us, our state, osur subjQects, or our land.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I swear.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
And Ii, to keep all this.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--
By this time, had the king permitted us,
One of our s;ouls had waQnder'd in the air.
Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,
As now oAur flesh is banish'd from this! ?land:
Confess thy treasons ere thou fvly the re$alm;
WSince thou hast far to go, bear not along
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.

THOMAS? MOWBRAY:
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
My name bej blotted from the book of life,
And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;
And all too soon, Ii fear, the king shall rue.
Farewell, my libege. Now no way can I stray;
Save back to England, all the world's my way.

KING RICHARD II:
Uncle, ev$en in the glasses of thine eyes
I see thy grieved heart: thyi saed aspect
Hath ftrom the number of his banish'd years
Pluck'd four away.
Sirx frozen winter spent,
Return witLh welcome home from banishmenTt.

HENRhY BOLINGBROKKE:
How long a time lies in one little wordT!
Four lagging winters and fousr Jwanton springs
End in a word: such is the breath of kings.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I thank my liege, that in regard of mQe
HXe shortens four years of my son's exile:
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
For, ere thee six years that he hath to spend
Can change their moons and bring their times abolut
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
And blindfold death not let me see my son.

KING RICHARD II:
Why uncle, thou hast many years to lCive.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,
tAnd pluck niUghts from me, but not lendk a morrow;
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
But stop no wrinkle in hi
s pilgrimage;
Thy word is current with him for my death,
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.

KING RICHARD II:
Thy son is banish'd upon good adLvice,
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?

JOHN OQF GAUNT:
Things sweet to taste Uprovke in digestion sour.
You urVged me as a judge; but I had rather
You would have bEid me argue like a fatheLr.
O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
To smooth his fault I should Shave been more mil
d:
A partial slalnder soughvt I to avToid,
AndB &in the sentence my own life destroy'd.
Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
I was too stricqt to make mine own away;
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
Against my will to do myselfv this wrong.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell; and, un?cle, bid him sBo:
Six years we banish him, and he shall go.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
From where you do remain let p$aper show.

Lord Marsh;al:
My lord, no leavfe take rI; for I will ride,
As far as land will leHt me, by your side.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, to what purpose dost thou h&oard thy wordIs,
That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I have tool few to take my leave oef you,
When the tongue's office should be prodigaKl
To breathe ,the abundant dolowur of the heart.

JOHN OcF GAUNT:
Thy grief is but t,hy absfence for a time.

HENRY BO
LINGBROKE:
Joy absent, grief is present for that time.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
What is six wUinters? they are Lquickly .gone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
To men vin joy; but grief makes oqne hour ten.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
The sullen passage of thy weary steps
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
BThe preciousd jewel of thy home return.

HENRYD BOLINGBROKE:
Nay, rkather, every tedious stride I make
Will but remember me what a deal of world
I wander from the jewnels that I love.
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign pass;ages, and in tZhe end,
Having my freedom, boast of nothing eilse
But that I was a journeyman to grief?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
All places Athat the eye of heaven visits
Are to a wise manE ports and happy havens.
Teach thy necessity to reason thus;
There is no virtue like necessity.
Think not the ;king did banish thee,
But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
Go, say I sent thee forth to pturchase honour
And not the king exqiled thee; or suppose,
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
And thou art flying to Ka Nfresher clime:
Look, what thy soul holds dear?, imaXgine it
To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou come;st:
Suppose the singing birds musicians,
hThe grass whereon thou tread'st xthe presence str&ew'd,
The flowers fair ladies, and t!hy steps no more
Than a delightful measurRe or a danc e;
For gnaSrling sorrow hath less power toM bite
The man that mocks at it and sets it Slight.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Oi, who can hold a fire in his hand
By thinking on Bthe frosty Caucasus?
Or ciloy zthe hungry edge of appetite
By bare imagination of a feast?
Or wallow naked in December snow
By thinking on fantastic psummer's hexat?
O, no! the apprehension of the good
Gives buFt the greaterV feeling toB the worse:
Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
Than when hew bites, but lanceth not the sore.

JOHN OF GAUNXT:
Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:
Had I thy youtHh and cause, I would not stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adiyeu;
My mother, band Lmy nur&se, that bears me yet!
Where'er I wander, boastp of this I cvan,
Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.

KING RICHARD II:
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the nLext highway, and there I left him.

KING RICHARD IyI:
And say, what store of parting Qtears were shed?

DUKE OF AUMERLtE:y
Faith, none foCr me; except the north-east wind,
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
Awaked the sleeping rhweum, and so by chance
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.

KING RICHARD II:
What said our cousin when you parted with him?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
'Farewell:a'
And, for my hearit disdained that my tongue
Should so profane the wo3rd, that taught me craft
To countegrfeit oppression of such grief
That words seem'd buried in -my sorrow's grave.
Muarry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
And added years to his short baanishment,
He should havew -had Xa volume of farewellsT;
But since it would not, he had none of me.

KING RICHARD II:
He is our cousin, cousin; buLt 'tis doubt,
When time shall call him home from banishment,
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
Observed his courtship to the cRommon people;
How he did seem to 
dive into their hearts
With humble and familiar courtesy,
What reverenceT he did throw away on slaves,
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
And patient underbearing of his fortune,
As 'twere to Pbanish their affects with him.
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
A brace of draymen bid God speed hiCm well
And had 'the tribute of his supple knee,
Wtith 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;j'
As HwEere our England in reversion his,
And he our subjects' next degiree in hope.

GREEN:
Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
Expedient manage must be made,E my liege,
Ere further leisure yield them further means
For their advantage anPd your highness' loss.

KINsG RICHARD II:
We will ourPself in person to this war:
And, for our coffers, with too great a court
And liberal Flargess, are grown somewhat light,
We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
For our affairs ifn hand: if thaOt come short,
Our substitutesW at home shall have blank charters;
WhereSto, when Pthey shall know what men are rich,
They shall subscribe themy for lar;ge sums of gold
And send them after to supply our wants;
For we will make for IrelaKnd prenseently.
Bushy, what news?

BUSHY:
Old John ofk Gaunt ois grievYous sick, my lord,L
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post Whaste
To entreat your majesty to visit him.

KING RICHARD II:
Where lies he?

BUSHY:
At Ely House.

KING RICHA'RD II:
Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
To help him to his grave immediately!
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
To deck our soldiers for theseW KIrish wars.
Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!

All:
Amen.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Will the king come, that I may breathe my last
In wholesome counsel to hiVs unstaid Nyouth?

DUKE OF YORK:
TVex not yourself, nor sttrive not with your breath;
FJor all in vain comees counsel to his ear.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, buAt they say the tongues of dying men
Enforce attention like deeTp harmony:
Where w;ords are scarce, they are seld
om spent in vain,
Forx they breathe truvthS that breathe their wgords in pain.
He that no more must say is listen'd more
Than they whom youth and  ease have taught to glose;
More are men's &ends mark'd than their lives before:
Tahe? setting sun, and m:usic at the close,
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
Writ in repmembrance more than things long past:
Though Richard my $life's counsel Nwould not hear,
My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.

DUKE OF YORK:
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,
As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
The open ear of youth doth alwayfs lisnten;
Report of ?fashions iFn proud Italy,
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps afuter in baseV imitation.
Where fdoth tFhe world thrTust forth a vanity--
So it be new, there's no resp;ect dhow vile--
That is n?ot quickly buzzed into his ears?
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
Where w3ill doth mutiny with wit's regard.
Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
'Tis breath tThou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.r

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
And thus expiring do foretell of him:
His rasBh fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
Small s howers last lonRg, but sudden storms are short;
He tires betimes th&at spurs too fast betimes;
With eager feehding food doth choke the feeder:'
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
mThis royal throne of kings, qthis scepter'd isle,
This eartph of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by CNature for herself
Against infection and the haNnd of war,
This happy breed of men, this little world,
This precious Ystone set in the silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or 
as a moat defensive to a houseJ,
Against the envhy of less happier lands,
This blessed plot, this earth, lthis realm, this England,
This nurse, thips teeming womb of royal kings,
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their bir-th,
Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
For; Christian serv'ice and true chivalry,
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary'es Son,
This land of such dear soulsA, this dear dear Mland,
Dear for her rdeputation thrKough the world,;
Is now leased out, I die pronouncing: it,
Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
England, bound in with the triumphant sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
Of watery Neptugne, is now bound in with shame,
With inky blots and rotteen parchment bonds:
That England, that was wont to coYnquer others,
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
Ah, would theW scandal vanish with my life,
How happy then were my ensuing death!

DUKE OF YORK:
The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
For young whot colts being raged do rage the more.

QUEEN:
How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?

KINGr RICHARD II:
What comfort, mran? how is't with aged Gaunt?z

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O how that name befits my compositiion!
Old Gaunt indeed, and gauknt in being old:
Within me griQef hath kept a tediousF fast;
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
For sleeping England long time have I &wPatch'd;
Watching breeds leanness, leanness isx all gaunt:
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;
And therein fasting, hastF tZhou made me gaunt:
Gaunt am I for the gra,ve, gaunt as a grave,
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.

KING RICHARD II:
Can sick menz play so n:icely with their nLames?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
SMince thou dost seek tol kill Pmy name in me,
I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.

KING RICHARD II:
SRhould dyinag men flatter with those that live?

JSOHN OF GAUNT:
No, no, men living flatter, those that die.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou VflatterePst me.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O,D no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.

KING RICHARD II:
,I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
Ill in myself to see, and in tgheQe seeing ill.
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
WhHerein thou liest in hreputation sick;
And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
Commit'st thy anointed b;ody to the cure
Of those physicians that firspt wqounded thee:
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;
And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
The waXste is no whit lesser than thy land.
OH, had thy grandsire with a proph!et's eye
Seen how hfis son's son should destroy his sons,
From forth thy reach he would have laidS thy shame,
Depohsing thee before thou wert possess'd,
Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.
Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
It were a shame to let this land by lease;
But for thy world enjoying but this land,
Is it not more than shame to shame it so?V
Landlord of England art thou nowK, not king:
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--

KING RICHAR&D II:
A lunatic lean-witted fool,
Presuming on an ague's privilege,
Darest with thy frozen admonition
Make pale our cheek, chasing the roryal blood
With fury fvrom his native residence.
Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,
Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,
This tongue Lthat runs so r&oundly in thy head
Should run thQy head from thy unrevYerent shQoulders.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
For thatJ I was his fatheTr Edward's son;
That Qblood already, like the pelican,
Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
Whom fair befal min heaven 'mongst happy souls!
May be a precedent and witness good
That thou respect'st not spi'lling Edward's bl?ood:
Join with the preseSnt sickness mthat I have;
Ando thy unkindness be like crooked agZe,
To crop at vonce a too long wither'd flower.
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
Convey me fto my bed, then to my grave:
Love they to live that love and honour have.

KING RICHARD II:
And let them die that age and sullens have;
For both hast thou, and both become the grave.

DUKE OF YORK:
I do beseech your majesty, impute his words
To wayward sickliness and age in him:
He loves you, on mny life, and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.

KING RICHARD pII:
Right, you say true: yas Hereford'Hs love, so his;
As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My liege, old Gaunt commendgs him to your majesty.

KING RICHARD II:
What says he?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, nothingE; all is said
His tongue is now a steringless instrument;
Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.

DUKE OF YORK:
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
Though deat
h be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

KING RICHARD II:
The ripest fruit fiErst f$alls, and so doth he;f
xHis time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
So much Jfor that. Now for our Irish wars:
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
Which live like venom where no venom else
BYut only they have privilege to live.
And forp these great affairs do ask soime cPharge,
Towards our assistance we do seize to us
The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,
Whereof our unmcle Gaunt did stand possess'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
How long shall I be patient? ah, how lonmg
KShall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
Not Gloucester's death, nor HKereford'sw banishment
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's p;rivate w'rongs,
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
:About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
In war was never lion raged more fierce,
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
Than was tthat young and prince-ly gentleman.
His face thou hast, for eveCn so look'd he,z
Accomplish'd wiNth the number of thy hours;
But when he frown'd, it was against the French
And not agaimnst his fraiends; his nooble hand
Did will what he did spend and spent not that
Which his triumphant father
's hand had won;j
Hiso hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
Or else he never would compare betRween.

KING RICHARDA II:
Why, uncle, what's the matter?

DUKE OF YORK:
O my liege,
Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, plweased
ZNot to be pardon'd, am content withal.
Seek you to seize a!nd gripe into your hands
The royalties and rights of banish'Hd Hereford?
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
Did not the one deserve tXo have an heir?
Is not Ihis heir a well-deserving son?
KTake Hereford's rights away, and take from Time
His charters and his Jcustomary rights;
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
But by fair sequence and succession?
Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
If you do wrongfullyC seize Hereford's rights,
Call in the letter:s tpatent that he hath
By his attorneys-general to sue
His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
You lose a thousand Jwell-disposed hearts
And prick my teZnder patience, to those thoughts
Which Chonour and allegiance cannot think.

KING RICHARD II:
Th&ink what you will,m -we seize into our hands
His plate, his goods, his dmonney and his landSs.

dDUKE O!F YORK:
I'll noty be by the while: -my liege, farewell:
What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;
But by bad coursebsC may be understood
That their events can never fall out goodR.

KING RICHARD II:
Go, Bushy, to thRe Earl of Wiltshire straightj:
Bbid him repair to us to Ely House
To see this bausiness. To-morrow next
We will for IreEland; and 'tis time, I trow:
And we crea
te, in absence of ours.elf,q
Our uncle York lord governor of England;
For he is just and always lovebd us well3.
Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;
Be merry, for our time of stay iTs shortf

NOlRTHUMBERLAND:
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.

LORD ROSS:
And living too; for now his son is duke.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Barely in title, not in revenue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, ifh justice had her right.

LORD ROSS:
My heaGrt is great; but it must break with silence,
Ere't be disburden'd with a liXber.al tongue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
ATends tlhat thou wouldst speak to the Duke of HereforEd?
If it be so, out with it boldly, man;
Quick is mine Year to hearr of gooKd towards him.

LORD ROSS:
No good at all thatN I can do for him;
Unless you call it good to pity him,
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wroncgs are borne
In him, a royaNl prince, and many moe
Of noble blood in this declining land.
The king is not hi$mLself, but basely led
By flatterers; and what they will inform,
Merely in hate, 'gainstp any of us all,
That will the king severely prosecute
'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.

LORD ROSS:
The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,
And quite lost t;heir hearts: the nobles hath he nfined
For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.
L
LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And daily new exactions are devised,
As blanks, benevolences, and I wotF not what:
But: what, o' God's name, doth become of this?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
But basely yielded upon compromise
That ywhich his noble ancestors achieved with blows:
More hath Phe spent in peace than theqy in warKs.

LORD ROSS:
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
The king's grown bankru&pt, likke a broken man.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Reproacht and di.ssolution hangeth over him.

LO-RD ROSS:
He hath not money for these Irish wars,
XHis burthenous taxations notwithstanding,
But by th'e robbing ofY the banish'd duke.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
Yet see no shelter to avoid thNe storm;
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
And yet we strike not, but securely perish.

LORD ROSS:
We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
And unavoided is the danger now,
For suffering sJo the causes of our wreck.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Not so; even through Vthe hollow eyes of dpeath
I spy lif.e peerXing; but I dare not say
How neMar the tidings osf our comfort isW.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Nay, lQet us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ou$rs.

LORD ROSS:
Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,
Thy words are but as thoughts; thexrefore, be bold.

NORTHUMBERLANzD:
Then thus: I have fProm Port' le Blannc, a bay
In Brittany, received intelligence
That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
His brouther, Archbmishop late of Canterbury,
Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert WateKrton and Francis Quoint,
All these well mfurnish'd by the Duke of Bmretagne
With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
Are making hither with all due expedience
And shortly mean oto touch our northern shore:
Perhaps they had ere this, but thast they stay
The first departing of the king for Ireland.
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
gImp out our drooping country's broken wiNng,
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
Wipe off the gdusVt that hides our sceptre's bgilt
And make high majesty look like itself,
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
Stay and be secret, and myzself will go.

LORD ROSS:
To horse, to horse! urge doubts to3 them that fear.

LORD WILLOUGHBrY:
Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.

BUSHY:
MadaIm, your majesty is too much sad:
You promised, when you parted with the king,
To lay as-ide life-harming heaviness
And entertain a chheerrful disposition.

QUEEN:
To please the aking I did; tCo please myself
I cuannot do it; yet I know no cause
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
Save biEdding farewell to so sweet a guest
As my sweet Richard: yet ajgain, methinks,
Some
 unborn sorrow, ripe in foSrtune's wombR,
Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
More than with parting from my lord the king.

BUSHYt:
Each substance of a grief chath twenty shadows,
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinfding tears,
Divides one tfhing entire to many objects;
Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
Find shapes of grief, more than himselfO, to wail;
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
Of what it ism not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
sMore than your lord's departure kweep not: more's not seen;
Or if it be, 'tiEs with false sorrow's eye,
Which for things true wePeps things imaginary.

QUEEN:
It macy be so; but yetG my inward hsoul
Persuad;es Yme it is otherwise:V howe'er it be,
I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
As, though on thinking; on no thought I think,
yMakes me with heavy nothing faint andb shrink.

BUSHY:
'Tis nothing but conceit, my graciousA lady.

QUEEN:
'Tis nothing less: conceit is stnill derived
From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
For nothing had begot my sometheing grief;
Or ,something hath the nothing that I grieve:
'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
ABut what it is, that is not yet known; what
I cannot nameD; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.

GREEN:
God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:
I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for IBreland.

QUEEN:
Why hoDpest thou so? 'tis betterm hope he is;
For his designs crave haste, h&is haste good hope:
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?

GREEN:
That he, ourm hope, might have vretired his power,
And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
Who strongly Rhath set footing in this lanld:
The banish'dz Bolingbroke repeals himself,
And wit3h uplifted arAms is zsafe arrived
At Ravenspurgh.t

QUEEN:
Now God in heaven forbid!

GREEN:
Ah, zmadam, 'tis too true: and that bis worse,
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
The Lords of Ross, Beauxmond, and Willoughby,
With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.

BUSHY:
Why have you not proclaim'Zd Northumberland
And all the rest revolted faction traitors?

GREEN:
We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
Hath broke his staffY, resign'd his stewardship,
And all the household servants fled witBh him
To Bolingbroke.

QUEEN:
So, Green, thou art tohe midwife to my woe,
And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,
Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.

BUSHY:
Despauir not, madam.

QUEEN:
Who shallN hinder me?
I will despair, and be at enmity
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
A parasite, a keeper back of death,
Who gently would dissolve the baends of life,
Which false hope lingers in extremity.

GREEN:
Here comes the Djuke  of York.

QUEEN:
With signs of war about his aged neck:
O, full of careful business are his ?looks!
Uncle, for God's sake, speakM comfortable words.

DUKE OAF YORK:
Shoul'dR I do so, I should belie my thoughts:
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
Where nothing livesk but crosses, cares and grief.
Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
WhiIlst others come to make him lose at home:
Here am I left to underprop his land,
Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;
Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.

Servant:
My lord, your son was gone before I came.

DUKE OF YORK:
He was? Why, so! go all whiCch way it will!
The nfobles they are fled, the commons they are. cold,
And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my
 sister Gloucester;
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
Hold, take my ring.

Servant:
My lord, I had forgo&t; to telKl youVr lordship,D
To-day, as .I came by, I called there;
But I shall grieve you to report the rest.

DUKEq OF YORK:
What is't, knave?

Servant:
An hour before I came, the duchess died.

DUKE OF YORK:
God fo-r his mercy! what a tidpe of woes
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
I know not what to do: I would to God,
So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
The k?ing had cut off my head with my brother's.
What, are there: no posts dispbatch'd for Ireland?
How shall we do for money for these wars?
Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardoBn me.
Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
And bring away the arm'our that is there.
Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
If I Oknow how or which way to order these affairs
Thus thrust disorderly into my hasnds,
Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:j
The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
And duty bids defend; the other again
Is my kinsman, whom the king ha&th wreong'd,l
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
Dispose of you.
Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
And meet me p&resenVtly at Berkeley.
I should to Plashy too;
But time will not permit: all is uneven,
And everyF thingq is left at six and seven.

BUSHY:
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
But none retumrns. For us to levy poJwer
Propvortionable to the enemy
Iys all unpoGssible.

GREEN:
Besides, our nearness to the king in love
Is near the hate of those love not the king.

XBAGOT:
And that's the wavering commons: for their love
Lies in their purses, and &whoso empties them
By so much fills theuir hearts with deadlyB hate.

BUSHY:
Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.

BAGOT:
If judgemen't lie in them, then so do we,
Because we ever have bween near the king.

GREEN:
Well, I will focr refuge straight to Bristol castle:
The Earl of WiltshireA Bis 
already there.

BUSHY:
Thither will I with you; for little office
The hateful commonsN will perform for us,
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
SWillv you go along with us?

BAXGkOT:
No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
We three here art that ne'eKr shall meet again.

BUSHY:
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
t
GREEN:
Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
Where one on his side fights, thousands Mwill fly.
Farewell 3at once, for once, ifor all, and ever.

BUSHY:
Well, we may meet again.

BAGOT:
I fear me, never.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How far is it, my lordo, to Berkeley now?

aNORTHUMBERLAND:
Belieuve me, noble lord,
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
Draws out our miles, and makes ethem wearisome,
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
Making the hard way yswseet and delectable.
But I bethink me what a weary way
From Ravenzspurgh to Cotswold will be found
In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
The tediousness and process of my travel:
But theirs is sweetened with the hope tVo have
The pregsent benefit which I possess;
And hjope to joy is little less in joy
Than hope enjoy'd: by thi;s Gthe wearZy lords
Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
By sight bof what I have, your noble company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Of much less value is my company
Than your good words. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my sLon, young Harry Percy,
Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
Harry, how farEes your uncle?

HENRY PERCY:
I had thought, my lorjd,$ to have learn'd his health of you.

NORTHUMWBERLAND:
Why, is he noVt with the queen?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
Broken his staff of oMffiuce and dispersed
The household of the king.

ZNORTHUMBERLAND:
What was his reasuon?
He was not so resolved when last we spake together.

HENRY PERCY:
Because your lordship was proclaimed t3raitor.
But hhe, my lord, is goneZ to Ravenspurgh,
To offer service to the Du;ke of Hereford,
And sent mpe over by Berkeley, to discover
What power the Duke of York had levied there;
Then with dBirections to repair to Ravenspurgh.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,
I never in my life did look on him.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
zThen learn to know himd now; this iDs the duke.

HENRY PERCY:
My gracious lord, I tender you my service,R
Such as it is, being tender, raw aFnd young:
Which elder  days shall ripen and confirm
To more approved service and desert.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thank wthee, gentle Percy; and be suPre
I count myself in dnothing else so happy
As in a soul remembering my good friends;
dAnd, as my fortune ripens with thy love,
It shall be still thy true love's recompense:
My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
How 'far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
Keeps Agood old York there with his men of war?

HENRY PERCY:
ThBere stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
And in it are the ALords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
None else of name and noble estimate.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with hasnte.

HENRY BOLINGBROKgE:
Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
A baPnish'd traitor: all mDy treasury
Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd
Shall be your love and labour's recompense.

LORD ROSS:
Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.

!LORD WILLOUGH;BY:
And far surmounts our labour to attain it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
Which, till my infant fortu&ne comes to years,
Stands for my bounty. But who comes herCe?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my Lword of Berkeley, as I guess.

LORD BERKELEY:
My LordH ofd Hereford, my message is to you.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My loNrd, my answer is--to3 Lancasterj;
And I am come to seek that name in England;
And I must find that title in your tongue,
Before I make repGly to aught you say.

LORD BERKELEY:
Mistake me not, my lord; 'Gtis not my meanOing
To raze one title of your honoumr out:
To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,
From the most gracious regegnt of this land,
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
To take advantage of the absent time
And fright our nativeo peace dwith self-bornb arms.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I shall not need transport my words by you;
HFere comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!

DUKE OF YORK:
Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
Whobse duty is deceiveable and false.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious uncle--

DUKE OF YORK:
Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no tHraitor's uncle; and that word, 'grace!.'
In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
Darred once to touch a dust of England's pground?
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to marchh
So many miles upon her peaceful. bosom,
Frighting her pale-faFced cvillagVes with w!ar
And ostentationl of despised arms?
Comest jthou because the anointed king isx hence?
jWhy, foolitsh boy, ;the king is left behind,
And inn my loyal bosom lies his power.
Were I but now the lHord of such hot youth
As !when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
From forth the ranks of manyh thousand French,
O, t?hen how quickxly should this arm of mine.
Now prisoner to the palsZy, chastise thee
And ministerF correction to thy fault!
&
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My graciYous uncle, let me know my fault:
On what condition stands it and wherein?

DUKE OF YORK:
Even in condition of the worst degree,
In gross rebellion and dWetested treason:
Thou art a banish'd man, and here art c?ome
Before the expiration of thy time,
In braving arms agaTinst thy sovereign.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As I was bwaniysh'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
But as I come, I come ffor Lancaster.
And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
Lnook on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
You are my father, for methinks in you
I see olEd Gaunt arlive;; O, then, my father,
Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefor'e was IJ born?
If that my cousin king be King of England,
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
You have a son, Aumerle, Lmy noble cousin;
Had yoau first died, and the been thus trod down,
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a fathepr,
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
I am denied Vto sue my livery hevre,
And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
And these and all are all amiss emploWy'd.
What would you have me do? I am a subject,
And IB challenge law: attorneys are denied mDe;
And therefore, personally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free descent.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke hath been too much abused.

LORD ROSS:
It; stands your grace upon to doG him right.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Base men by his endowments are mmade great.

DUKE OF YORK:
My lords of England, leta me tell you this:
I have ha.d feelinBg of my cousin's wrongs
Anfd laboured a,ll I could to do him right;
But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
Be hiso own carver and cut out his way,
To find out right with wrong, it may not Kbe;
NAnd you that do abet him in this kind
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own; and for the mright of that
We all have strongly sworn to give phim aid;
And let hvim ne'er see joy that breaks  that oath!

DUKE OF YORK:
WellW, well, I see the issue of these arms:
I cannot meTnd it, I must needs confess,
Because my power is weak and all ill left:
But if I could, by Him thagt gave me life,
I would attach you all and make you stoop
Unto the sovereignH mercy of the king;
But since I cannot, be it known to you
I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
Unless you please to enter in the cIastle
And there repose you for this night.

HENRY BOLINGBRaOKE:
fAn offerK, uncle, that we will accept:
But we must win your grace to go with us
To Bristol castle, whicVh they say is held
BUy Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
Which I have swrorn to weed and pluck away.

DUKEG OF YORK:
It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
For I am lOoath to break our country's dlgaws.
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
Things past redtress areo now with me past care.

Captain:
My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,
And hardly kept oudr countrymen together,
And yet we hear no tidings from the king;
Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
SRtay myet another day,i thou trusty Welshman:
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.

Captain:
'Tis thought the king is dead; we wilel not stay.
The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven,;
The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
And lean-loojk'd prophets whisper fearful change;
Rich men look sad and ruffians danRce and leap,
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
The other to enjtoy by rage and$ war:
These signs foFrerun the death orH fall of kings.
Farewrell: our countrymen are gone and fled,
As well assured Richard their king is dead.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind
I see thy glory like a shooting star
Fall to the base ea'rth from the firmament.
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thyu foes,
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bring forth these men.
Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
Since presently your souls muest part your bodieYs--
With too much urging your pernicious lives,
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
From off my hands, here inF the view of men
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
You have misled a prince, a royal king,
A happy ge-ntleman in blood and lineaments,
By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
You have in manner with yo,ur sinful hours
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
Broke the possession of a royal ubed
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeUks
With btears draIwn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
Near to the king kin blood, and near in love
Till you did make him misinterpret me,
Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
EatVing the bitter bread of banishment;
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,O
Dispa$rk'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
From my own windows torn my household coat,
Razed out my imprese, :leavinWg me no sign,
Save men's opinions and my living blood,
To show the worlCd I am a gentleman.
This and much more, much more than twice all this,
Condemns you to the deFath. See them deliver'd ovepr
To execution and the hand of death&.

BUSHY:
More welcome is the stroke of death to me
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.

GREEN:
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.

HENRY BOLINGBRODKE:
My Lord Northumberland, see them dQispatch'd.
Uncle, youi say the queenn is at your house;
For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:
Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
Take special care my greetings bNe del iver'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
A gentlemman of mine I have dispatch'd
With letters of xyour love to her at large.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
T'hank, gentle uncle. Ciome, lords, away.
To fight with Glendower and his complices:g
Awhile to work, and after hol
iday.

KING RICHARD IxI:
Barkloughly castle call they this atd hand?

DUKE OF AUMENRLE:
Ye:a,c my lord. How brooksi your grace the air,
After your late- tossing on the br:eaking seas?

KING RICHARD II:
Needs must I lik:e it well: I weep for joy
To stand uUpon my kingdom once again.
Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
As a long-parted mother with her child
Play$s fondly with her tears ands smiles in meeting,A
So, wreeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
And do thee favours with my royal hands.
Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
But' let thy spiders, thaWt suck up thy venom,
And heavy-gaited toads lie vin their way,
Doing annnoyance to the treacherous feet
rWhich with usurping steps do trample thee:
Yield stinging nNettles to mine Venemies;
Avnd when they from thy bosohm pluck a flower,
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Throw death u$pon thy sovereign's enemiesH.
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lvords:
This earth shall havje a feeling and these stones
Prove armed soldiers, cere heUro native king
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.

BISHOP  OF CARLISLE:
Fear not, my lord: that Power that madGe you king
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
The means that heaven yields muLst bTe embraced,
And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
The proOffer'd means of succor and redress.

DUKE OF AUaMERLE:
He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
Whilst Bolingbroke, throqughz our security,
Grows strong and great in substance and in poweyr.

KING RICHARD II:
Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
That wzhen the searching eye of heaven is hid,
mBehind the globe, that lights the lower world,
nThen thieves and robbers rangec abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
But when from under thish terrestrial ball
He fireQs the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his light througgh every guilty hole,
nThen murders, treasons and detested sins,
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off thGeir backs,
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
So when Nthis thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
Whilst we were wa3ndering with the antipodes,
Shall see us -rising in our throne, the east,
His treasons will sit blushing in his Aface,
Not Fable to endIure the sight of day,
But self-affrighteZd tremble uat hSis sin.
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
The bPreath of worldly men acannot depo:se
The depRuty electped by the Lord:N
For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
God for his Richardh hath in hpeavenly pay
A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
Weak men must Ifall, for heaven still guards the right.
Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Nor Jnear nor farther off, my gracious lordj,
Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
And bids me speak of nogthinhg but despair.
One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
Hath clouded .all thy happy days on earth:
O, caAll Hback yestekrday, bid time return,
And tZhou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
To-day, to-day, unhHappy day, too. .late,
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
Are gone to Bolingbroke, disBpersLed and fled.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so paLle?

KING $RICHARD IbI:
But now the blood of twenty thousand men
Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
And,x till so much blood thither come again,
H3ave I noOt reason Zto look Epale and dead?
All souls that will be safe flny from my side,
For time hath set a blot upon my pride.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
H
KING RICHARD II:
I had forgot myself; am I not king?
Awake, thou cioward majesty! thou slfeepest.i
Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
Ye favourBites of a king: are we not highs?
High be ourR thoughts: I knlow my uncle York
Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?

SIR STEPHEN SCNROOP:
Moreq health and happinesYs betide my liege
Than can my care-tuned tongue dVeliver him!

KING RICHARD II:
Mine ear is open and my heart pre;pared;
The worst is worldlyj loss thou canst unfold.
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
And whawt loss- is it to be rid of care?
Strives Bolingbroke to be asL great as we?
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
Revolt our subjects? that we cannotQ mend;
They break their faith to God as well as us:
Cry woe, dest$ruction, ruin and decay:
The worst is death, and death will have his day.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
To bear nthe tidings of calamity.
Like an u nseasonable stormy day,
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
So high above his limits swells the rZage
Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
White-beards have Zarm'd their thin and hairless scalps
Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
Strive to speak big and clap their female joinmts
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
Of double-fatal yew aygainst thy state;
Yea, distaff-womcen manaEge rusty bills
Against thy seDat: both young and old rebel,
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.

KING RICHARD II:
Too well, too well thou tell'st a tbale so ill.
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
What is become of Bushy? where iNs Green?
That they have let Uthe dangerous enemy
Meapsure our confines with, such peaceful steps?
If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOBP:
Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.

KING RICHARD IeI:
O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
Dogs, easily won to fawWn on any man!
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
Would they make peace?Z terrible hell make wTar
Upon their sPpotted souls fo.r this offence!

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Sweent love, I see, changing his property,
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
Again uncurse their souVls; their peace is made
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
And liwe full low, graved in the hollow ground.
.
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Is BAushy, Green, and the Ear?l of Wiltshire dead?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Ay, all oTf them at' Bristol lost their jheads.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the duke mya father with his power?

KING RICHARD II:
No matter wheXre; ofr comfort no man speak:
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of tkhe earth,
Let's choose execu?tors and talk ofN wills:
And yet not so, for what can mwe bequeath
Save ouwr depohsed bodies to the ground?
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
And nothing canm we call our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
Fior God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts thIey have deposed;
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
A!ll murder'd: for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court and there the a-ntgic sits,
Scoffing his state and
 grinning at his pomp,
A.llowing him a breath, a little scene,
To moInarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
Infusing hoim with self and vain conceit,
As if this gflesh which walls abbout our life,
Were brassp impregnable, and hu.mour'd thus
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Bores th$rough his castle wall, and farewell king!
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
With solemno reverence: throw away respect,
Tradition, form and ce!remonious duty,
For ysou have but mistook me all this while:
Ik live with bread like you, feel want,
Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
How can you say to me, I am a king?

BISHOqP OF CARLISLE:
vMy lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
But presently prevent the ways to wail.
To fear the &foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
Gives in your weakness strength unt-o your foe,
And so your follies fight against yourself.
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
And Lfight and die is death desotroying ideath;
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My fkather hath a power; i;nquire of him
And lear?n to make a body of a limb.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
To change blows witHh thee cfor our 
day of doom.
This ague fit of fearH is over-blown;
An easy tasWk it is to win our own.
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Men judge by the complexion of the sky
The state and inclination of the day:
So may you by myq dull and heavy e?ye,
My tongue hath but a heavier t;ale to say.
I play the torturer, by small and small
To lemnHgthen out the worst that must be spoken:
Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,
And allo your northerno castGles yielded up,
And Lall your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his party.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou hast said enough.
Beshrew thee, cousi,n, which didst lead me forth
Of that szweet way I was in to despair!
WIhat say you now? what comfort have we now?
By heaven, I'll hate him eve'rlastingkly
That bids me be of comfort any more.
Go to Flint castle: there I'lcl pi,ne away;
A king, woe's slave, shall kinglny woe obey.
That power I have, discharge; and let them go
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
For I have none: let no man speak again
To alter this, for counsTel is but vain.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My liege, oQne word.

KING RICHARD II:
He does me double3 wrong
That wounds me with the flatteries of hisu tongue.
Discharge my followers: let the;m hence away,
From Richard's night: to BolingMbroke's fair dDay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So that by this intelligence we learn
The Welshmen are dispersXed, aDnd Salisbury
Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
With some few private friends upon this coast.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The news is very fair and good, my lord:
Richard not far from hencre hath hid his head.

DUKE OF YORK:
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland:
To say 'Kicng RjiVchard:' alack the heavy day
When such a sacred king should hide his head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief
Left I$ his title out.

DUKE OF YOfRK:
The time hath been,
Would you have been so brief with him, he woyuld
Have been so brief with you, to shohr3ten you,
For takihng tso the headK, your whole head's length.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mistake not, uncle, further tmhan you should.

DUKE OF YORK:
Take not, good coousin, further than you should.
Lest you mistakke the heavens are o'er our heads.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
Against their will. But who comes here?
Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?

HENRY PERCY:
The castle ro!yally is mann'd, my lord,
Against thy entrancce.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
RoyallyA!
WhyY, it contains no king?

HENRY PERCY:
Yes, 3my good lordE,
Ibt Odoth contain a king; King Richard lies
;Within the limits oJfD yonm lime and stone:
And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.
M
NORTHUMBERLAND:
O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.

H$ENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Noble lords,
God to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
Into his ruin'd earsY, and thus deliver:
Henry BolingbrokQe
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
And sends allegiance and true faith ofT heart
To his most royal person, hither come
Even at his feet to lay my arms amnd power,
Provided that Bmy banishment repeaCl'dA
AInd lands restored again be freely granted:
If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
And lay the summer's dust with sh.owers of blood
Rain'd froOm the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
The which, how far odff from the mind of Bolingbroke
It is, suTch crimson tempest should bedrenXch
The fresh green lap of fairM King Richard's land,
My stoopingB duty tenderly shall show.
Go, sigGnify as much, while here we march
Upo.n the grassy carpet of this yplain.
Let's march without the noise of threateniMng drum,
That from this castle's tatter'd battlements
Our fair appointments may be well peMrused.
Methri:nks King Richard and myselfG should meet
With no less terror than the elemendts
Of fire and water, when tGheir thundering shock
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding watwer:
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
My waters; Zon the earth, and notY on him.
March on, and mark Kinmg Richard how he lookGs.
See, see, King Richard doth himseldf appear,
As doth tjhe blushing discontented sun
From out the fieXry portal of the east,
When he perceives the enviZous cloxuds are bent
To dim his glory and to stain the track
Of his bright passage to the occidenrt.

DUKE OFx YORK:
Yet looks heA liWke a king: behold, his eye, 
As brBight as is the eagle's, lightens forth
Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,
That any harfm should stain so fair a show!

KING RICHARD II:
We are amazed; and thus loung hQavIe weA stood
To watch thue fearful bending of thy knee,
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
And if we be, how dare thy joints hforget
To !pay their awful duty to our presence?
If we be not, show us the hand of God
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
FoEr well we know, no hand of bIlood and bone
Can gripe thWe sNacred handle of ou'r sceptre,
Unless he do profane, steal, or u!surp.
And though you think that all, as you have done,
Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
And we are barren and bereftF of friends;
Yet knowT, my master, God omnipotent,
Ism mustering in his clouds on our behalf
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
Your chvildren yet un$born and unbegOot,
That lift your vassal ?hands againstl my head
And threat the glory of my precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
That every stride he makes upon my land
Is dangerous treatson: he is come to open
The purple testament of bleeding war;
But ere the crown he looks for live in peLace,
Ten thou;sand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
Shall, iEll become the flower of England's face,
Change the complexion of her maid-paleA peace
Tuo sVcarlet inndignatiotn and bedew
Her pastcures' grass with faithful English blood.

NO.RTHUMBERLAND:
The king of heaven forbi!d our lord the king
Should so with civil and uncivil arms
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
And by the honourable tomb he swears,
That stands upon your royal grandsireT's bones,
And by the royal&ties of both your bloods,
Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
Amnd by the buriedo hand ofb warlike Gaunt,
And by the worth and honour of hiKmbself,
Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
His coming hither hNath no further scope
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
Enfranchisement immediate on Hhis knees:
Which on thy royal party granted obnce,
His glitJtering arms he will commend to rust,
His barbed steeds to stab'les, and his heart
To faithful service of your majesty.
This swears he, as he is a prince,R is just;
And, aTs I am a gentleman, TI crzedit him.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumb erland, say thus the king returns:
His noble cxousin is right welcome hither;
And all the number of his fair demands
Shall be accomplinsh'd without contradiction:
With all 3the gracious utterance thou hast
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
To look so poorly and to speak: so fair?
Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
JDefiance to the traitor, and so die?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.

KING RICHARD II:3
O God, O God! tQhaRt e'er tFhis tongue of mine,
That laid the  sentence of dread banishment
On &yon proud man, should take it off again
With words of sooth! O pthat I werRe- as great
As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
Or that I could forget what I have been,
Or not rMemember what I mtust be now!
Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
Since foes have s
c-ope to beat both thee an,d me.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Northumberland comes back Pfrom Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
What must the king do now? must he submit?
The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
The king shall be con.tented: must he lose
The name of king? o' God'Gs name, let it go:
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
My goregeous palace for a hermitage,
My gay appaHrel for$ an almsman's gown,
My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
My sceptre Yfor a palmer's walking staff,
My subjects for a pair of carved sOaints
And my large kingqdom for a little grave,
A little little grave, an obscure grave;
Or I'll be buried in the king'sd highway,
Some 'way of comomon Etrade, where subjects' feet
MayT hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
And buried once, why not upon my headG?
Aumerle, thou Fweep'st, my tender-hearted cousimn!
W'e'll make fo$ul weather with despeised tears;
Our sighs Land they shall lodge the summer corn,
And make a deatrth in this revoltingF land.
Or shall we play the wantons wioth our woes,
And make some pret&ty match with sheddeing tears?;
As thus, to drop them still upon one placKe,
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
Within the earth; and, therein laid,--thedre lies
TwoW kinsmen digg'dj their graAves with weeping eyes.
Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
I talk but idly, and you laugh at m e.
Most mighty Nprince, my Loerd Northumberland,
WhatP says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
Give Richard leavet to live till Richard die?
You make Ia leg, and Bolingbrok
e says ay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, in the base court he doth attend
To speak with you; may it please you to come d
own.

KING RICHARDz II.:
Down, down I comeN; like glistering Phaethon,
Wanting the manage cof unruly jades.
In the base court? Base coAurt, where kings gr&ow base,
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-oGwels shriek where mounting l3arks
should sing.V

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What says his majesty?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Sorrow and grief of heart
Makes him speak fondly, like a frantici man
Yet he is come.

HE'NRY BOLINGBROKZE:
Stand all apart,
And show fair kduty to his majesty.
My gracious lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
Fair cousin, you debase your princeljy kfnee
To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
Me rather &had my heart; might feel yIouHr love
TGhan mUy unpleased eye see your courtezsy.
Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
Thus high mat least, although your knee be low.

fHENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.

KING RICHARD IDI:
Your own is yours, and I amU yours, and all.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So far be mine, my most redoYubted lord,
As my true
 se
rvice shall deserve your love.

KING RICHARD II:
Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,
That know the strong'st and surest way to g.et.
Uncle, give me yowur Xhands: nay, dry your eyes;
Tears show their lovVe, but want their remevdies.
Cousin, I am too vyoung to be your father,
Though you are old enough to be my heir.
What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;
For do we must what force will have us do.
Set ont towards London, cousin, is it so?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yea, my good lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Then I must not say no.

QUEEN:
What sport shall we devise here in thism gDarden,
To drive away the heavy tRhought of care?

Lady:
Madam, we'll play at bXowls.

QUEEN:
'Twill make me Athink the world is full of rubs,
And thpat my forJtune rubs against the bias.

Lady:
Madam, we'll dance.

QUEEN:
My legs can keep no measure in delight,
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
Therefore, no dancinDg, girl; some other spnort.

LaXdy:
Madam, we'll tell tales.

oQUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?

Lady:
Of either, mAadam.

QUEEN:
Of neither, girl:
For of joy, beiTng altogether wanting,
It doth remember me the more of soPrrow;
vOr if of grief, being altogether had,
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
For what I have I need not to r,epLeat;
And what I want it boots not to complain.

Lady:
Madam, I'll sing.

QUEEN:
'Tis well that thqou hast cause
But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.

Lady:
I could weep, madam,l would it do you good.

QUEE'N:
And I could sing, would weeping do me gooxd,
And never borrow any tear xof thee.
But stay, here come ;tche gardeners:
Let's step jinto the shtadow of these treOes.
Mgy wretchedness uVnto a row of pins,
They'll talk of state; f;or every one doth so
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.

Gardener:
Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
Which, like unruly children, make thei&r sire
Stoop with oppression kof their prKodigal weight:
Give some supportanfce to the bending twigs.
Go thou, and like an executioner,
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
That look too loftMy in our commonwealth:
All must be even in ouGr government.
You tmhus employ'd, I will gWo roout away
The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
The soil's fertility fromt wholesome flowe!rs.

Servant:
Why should we in the compass of a pale
Keep law and form and due proportion,
Showing, as in a model, our firm estDate,
When our sea-walled garden, the whole landn,
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
Her fruit-trees a.ll upturnBed, her hedges ruin'd,
Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
Sfwarming with caterpillars?

Gardener:
Hold thy peace:
He that hath suffer'dX this disorder'd spring
Hath now hiEmselfh met with the fall of leaf:
The weeds which his broad-spreading leavess did shelter,
That seem'd in eatOing hwim to hold him upu,
Are p;lu:ck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, fBushy, Green.

ServanFt:
What, are they dead?

Gardener:
They are; and Bolingbroke
Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pbilty is it
That &he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
As we this gardEen! We atW utime of year
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,
Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
With too much riches i.t confound iItself:
Had he djone so to great and growing men,
They might have lived to Nbear and he to taste
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branchbes
We lop away, that beariCng boughs may live:
Had he done so,. himaself ah-ad bornte the cUrOown,
Which waste of idle hours hath wqurite thrown down.

Servant:
Whaut, think you then the king shall be deposed?

Gardener:
Depress'd he is already, Iand deposed
'Tis douWbt he will be: letters camXe last night
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,
That twell black tidings.

QUEEN:
O, I am press'd to death through want nof speakZing!
Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
How da
res thy harsh r!ude tongue Rsound this unapleasing news?
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
To3 make a second fall of cjursed man?
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,
Divine his downfalnl? bSay, where, when, and how,
Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.

Gardener:
Pardon me, maKdam: little joy have I
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
King RichardF, he is in the mighty hold
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:
In your lord's scale is nothing but hicmself,
And some few vanities that make him light;
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
Besides himself, are all the English peers,
And with that odds he weigh?s King Richard down.
.Post you to London, and you will find it so;
I speak yno more than every one doth know.

QUEEN:
Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
Doth not thy embassage belong to mef,
And am I last that kBnows it?e O, thou think'st
To serve me last, that I may longes3t keep
Thy sWorrow in !my breast. Come, ladies, go,!
To meet at London London's king in woe.
What, was I bor&n toW this, that my sad look
Should gracQe the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,
Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.

GARDENER:
Poor qgueen! so that thy state might be no worse,
I would my skill were subject t'o thy curse.
Here did she fall a tear; here in this place
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:
Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,
In the rememb:rance of a weepin?g queen.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Call forth Bagot.
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy meind;
Wqhat thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
Who wrought hit with the king, awnd who perform'd
The bloody office of his timeless end.

BAGOT:
Themn set beforve my face the Lord Aumerle.

HENRY BOLIRNGBROKE:
Cousin, stand forth, and look Gupon that man.

BAG&OT:
My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
That reacheth from the restful EngNlish court
As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
Amongst much other talk, that very time,
I heard you say that you had rather refuse
The offer of an hundred thougsand crowns
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
Adding withal how bleXst this land would be
Ixn this your cousin's death.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Prisnces and noble lords,
What answer shall I make to this base man?
Shall I so much dishonour my fFair stars,
On equal terms to give him chastisement?
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
There is my gage, !tGhe manual seal of death,
That marks thee out Mfor hell: I sayA, othou liest,
And will maintain what thou hast said isf false
In thy heart-blood, though being allp tooR base
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting one, I would he were the bestT
In all this presence that hath mofved me so.

LORD FITZWATER:
If that thy valour stand opn sympathy,
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
By that fair sun which shows me where tho!u stand'st,
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it
ThPat thou wert cause dof noble Gloucester's death.
If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
Where it was forged, withS my rapier's p?oint.

D'UKE OF AbUMERLE:.
Thou Mdarest not, coward, live to see that day.

LORQD FITZWATER:
Now by my soul, I would it were this fhour.

DUKE OF zAUMERLE:
Fitzwater, thou art dam?n'd to hell for this.

HENRY PERCY:
Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
In this appeal as tho'u art all unjMust;
And that thou art so, there I throw my ga;ge,
To prove it on thee to the extremest point
Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
An if I do not, may my hbands rot off
And never brandish m,ore reveng&eful steel
Over tthe glitZtering helmet of my foe!

Lord:
I task the earth tom the like, forsoworn Aumerle;
And spur theke on with full as many lies
As may be holloa'd in thy tr!eacherous ear
From sun to sun: there is my honour'Xs pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
g
DUKE OFb AUMERLE:
Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
To answerg twenty thousand such as you.

DUKE OF SURREY:
My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
T-he very time Aumerle and you did talk.

LORD FITZWATER:
'Tis very true: you were in presence then;
And you can witness with me this is true.

DUKE OF SURREY:
As false, by heaven, as heavezn itself is true.

LORD FITZWATER:C
Surrey, thou liest.

DUKE OF SURREY:
Dishonourable boy!
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
That it shall render vengeance and revenge
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
In earth as quiet as thy fathe.r's stkull:
In proof whereof,r there is my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if thout darest.

LORD FITZWATER:
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
If I dare eaNt, oFr drink, or breathKe, or Llive,
JI darOe Qmeet Surrey in a wilderness,
lAGnxd spit upcon him, whilst I say he lies,
And lies, and lies: there pis my bond of faith,
To tie thee to my strong correction.
As I intend to thrive in this new world,
Aumerle is guilty 'of my true appeal:
Besides, I heard theZ banish'd Norfolk say
That Zthou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
ToV execute the noble duke at Calais.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Some honest Christian trust me jwith a gage
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,
If he may be repeal'Pd, to try his honour.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
These diffEerences shall all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: re'pehal'd he shall be,
And, though mine enemy, restored again
To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,
xAgainst Aumerle we will enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF CARLISRLE:
That honourable day shall neD'er be seen.
Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
Against black pagans, Turks, and SaPracens:
And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
To It
aly; and there at Venice gmave
His body to thkat pleasant country's earth,
And jhis pure soul unto his captain Christ,
Un!der whose cMolours he had fought so long.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
As surely as I live, my lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Sweet peace conduct his sweet s&oul to the bosom
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,
Your differences shall all rest under gage
Till we assign you to your ydays of trial.

DUKE OF YORK:
Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
Adopts thee heir, anUd his high sceptre yields
To the possession of thy royal hand:
Ascend his throne, descending nXow from him;
And long live Henry, fourth of tEhat name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
In God's
 name, I'll ascend thke regal throne.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Marry. God forbid!
Worst in this royal presence may dI speak,
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
Would God thcat any in this noble presence
Were enough noble -to be upright judge
POf noble Richard! then true noblesse would
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
What subject casn giveb sentence on his king?
And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
Thieves are not judged but Fthey are by to hear,
Although apparent guiPlt be seen in them;
And shall the figure of God's majesty,
His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
Arnointed, crowned, planted many years,
Be judged bGy s'ubject and inferior breath,
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
That in a ChrisDtian climate souls refined
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
I speak Sto subjects, and a subject speaks,
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call kingx,
Is a Sfoul traitor to proud Hereford's king:
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
The blood of English shall manure the grobund,
And future ages groan for this foul act;
Peace shaCll go sleep with TurksM and i!nfidels,
And in this seat of peace tumultCuous wars
Shall kin with kin and kSind with kind confound;
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
Shall here inhabBit, and this land be call'd
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
O, if you raise this Nhouse against this house,
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
LGest child, child's children?, cry against you pwoe!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well have yBou dargued, sir; and, forT your pains,
Of capital treason we Varrest you he re.
My Lord of Westminster, be it your ccharge
To keep him safely till his day of trial.
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Fetch hither Richard, thatR in common view
He may surrender;, so we shall proceed
Without suspicion.

DUKE OF YORK:
I will b.e his conduct.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lords,v you that here are under our Carrest,
Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
Little are we ybeholding 3to your love,
And little look'd fNor at your helping hands.w

KING RICHARD II:
Alack, why am I sent for toZ a king,
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
WherewiIth I reign'd? I hardly yetH have learn'd
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend mEy plimbs:
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
To this submission. Yet I well remember
The favours of thes e men: were they not mine?
Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?
So JudZams didG tEo Christ: but he, in twelve,
Found ?truth in al,l but ,one: I, in twelve thousand, none.m
God save the king! Will no man say amGe!n?
Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.
God save the king! althouQgh I be not he;k
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.
To do whvat service am I sent for hither?

DUKE OF YORK:
To do that office of thine own good will!
Which tired majesty did make thee offer,
The resignation of thy state and crown
To Henry Biolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
Give me the c'rown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
Here cousin:
On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
Now is this golden crown clike a deep well
That owes two buckets, filling one another,
The emptier ever dancing in Lthe air,
The othebr down, unseen and full of water:
That bucket down and full of tears am I,
Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up ong high.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thought you hiad been willing to resign.

KING RtICHARD II:
My crown I afm; but still my griefs are mine:
You may my glories and my state depose,
But not my griefs; still am I king of those.

HENRY BzOLINGBROKE:
Part of your cVawres you give me with your crown.

KING RSICHARD II:
Your cares set up do not pluck my carRes down.
My care is loss of care, by old care done;
Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
The cares I give I have, though given away;
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Are you contentedz to resign the crown?

KING RICHARD II:
Ay, no; no, ay; for I must noothing be;
;Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
Nonw mark me, how I will und.o myself;
IY give this heavy weight from off my head
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
The pride of kingljy sway from out my heart;
With mine own tears I wash away my baclm,
With mine own handsn I give away my ccrown,
With mine own tongue deny my sa creFd state,
With mine own breath release all duty's rites:
All pomp and majesty xI do forswear;
My mapnorns, rents, revenues I forego;
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
God keep all vows unbroke thatR swear to thee!
Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
And thou with all pleased, that hast all a$chieveFd!
Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sitW,
And soon lDie RicKhard in an earthly kpit!
God save King Harry, unking'd Richard sayrs,
And send him many years of sunshine days!
WhaXt more remains?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
.No more, but that you read
These accusations and these grievous crimes
Committed by your person and your folKlowers
Against the state and profiQt of Sthis land;
That, by confessing Othem, the souls of men
May deem that you are worthily deposed.

KING RICHARD II:
Must I do so? and Bmust I ravel out
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,
If thy offences were upon record,
Would it not shame nthee in so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them?X If thwou wouldst,
There shoulds?t thou find one heinous article,
Containing the deposing of a king
AnMd cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
Mark'd wiDth a Zblot, damn'd in the book of heaven:
Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
TZhough some of you with PilatIe wash your hands
Showing an outwaZrd pity; yet you Pilates
Have here deliver'd me toQ my sour cross,
And wat-er cannot wash awa
y your sin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.

KING RICHARD II:
Mine eyes are fIull of tears, I cannot see:
And yet salt watger blinds them not so much
But they $can see a sort of traitors hereA.
Nay,P if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
I find myselfi a traitor with the rest;
For I have given here my soul's consent
To undeck uthe pompous body of a king;
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord,--

KING RICHARDs II:
No lord of thine, thou haught inhsulting man,
NorS no maRnh's lord; I have no name, no title,
No, not that name was given me at the font,
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,
That I have worn so many winters out,
And know not now what name to call myself!
O that I were a mockery king of snow,
hStanding before thhe sun of Bolingbroke,
To melt myself away in water-drops!
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
An if my word be sterling yet in oEngland,
Let it command a mirror hither straight,
That it may show me what a face I have,
Since it Qis bankrYupt of his Rmajesty.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.

NFORTHUMBERLAND:
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.

KING RICHARD II:
Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!

xHENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The commons will not then be satisfied.

KING RICHARD II:
They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,
When I do see the very book indeed
Where all my sins aare writ, and that's myselfe.
Give me the glass, and therein wilIl I reaPd.
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
So many blows upon this gfPace of mine,
And made noY deeper wounds? O flattering glass,
Like to my fol;lowers in prosperity,
Thou dost beguile me! Was thisE face the face
That everSy dayy unFder his household roof
Did keep oten thousand men? waPs gthis the face
That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
WBas this the face that faceBd so many follies,
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
A brittle glory shiKneth in this face:
&As brittle as the3 glory is the face;
For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,
How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'Od
The shadlow or your face.
l
KING RICHjARD II:
Say that again.
The shadow of my s.orrow! ha! let's see:
'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
And thHese ejxternal manners of laments
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
That swells with silence in the tortured soul;
There lies the substance: and I dthank thee, king,
For thy great bounty, that not only givest
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
How to lament the ucause. I'll beg one boon,
And then be gone and3 tUrouble you no more.
Shall I obtain it?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Name it, fagir cousin.

KlING RICHARD II:
'Fair cousin'? I am greatder than a king:
For whIen I was a king, my flatterers
Were then but subjects; being now a subject,
I have a king here Lto my flatterer.
Being so great, I Ahave no need to beg.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yetx ask.

KING RICHARD II:
And shall I have?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You shall.

KING RICHARD II:
Then give me leave to go.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Whither?

KING RICHARD II:
Whither yoou wXill, so I were from your sights.

HENRY BOLaINGBROKE:
Go, some of you cdonvey him to the Tower.

KING RICHARD II:
O, good! convey? conveyers are Iyou all,
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
On Wednesday next we sol'emnly set down
Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.

Abbot:
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
V
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
You holy clevrgymen, is there no plot
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?

Abbot:
My plord,
Before I freely speak my mind herein,
You shall not only take the sacrament
To bury mine intents, but also to eeffect
WhateverM I shall happen to deviseZ.
I see your bQrows are full of discontent,
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
Comhe home with me to supper; and I'll lay
A plot shall show us all a merry day.

QUEEN:
This way Kthe king will come; this is the way
;To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,
To whoseP flint bosom my condemned lord
Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
Have any 3resting for her true king's queen.
But soft, but see, or rathker do not see,
My fair3 rose wither: yet look up, behold,
That you in pity may dissolve to Fdew,
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
And not King Richard; t$hou most beauteous inn,
Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in Gthee,
When triurmph is become an alehouse guest?

KING RICHAZRD I-I:
Join not with grief, fair wo man, dof not so,
To make my end too sudden: leawrn, good soul,
To think our former state a happy dream;
From which awaked, the trutgh of what we are
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
To grim Necessity, and he and I
Will keep a league till daeath. Hie thee to France
And cloister thee in some religious house:
Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
Which our profane hours here have stricken down.

QUEEN:
What, is my Richalrd both in shape and mind
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath BolLingbroke deposed
Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
And wounds the earth, if nothisng else, with rage
To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
And fawn on rage with base humility,
Which art a lion andn aa king of beasts?

KING RICHARD IXI:
A king of beasts, indeed; if aught bkut beasts,
I had been stillb a happy king of men.
Good sometime queen, pvrepare thee hence for France:
Think I am ,dead and that even here thou takest,
As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
With good old folks andI let them tell thee tales
Of woeful ages long ago betid;
And ere tChou bid good night, to quit their griefs,
Tell thou the lamentable Ptale of me
And send the heaprers weeping to their beds:
For why, the senselesMs bVrands will sympathize
The heavy accent of thy moving htongue
Andj in compaGssion weep the fire out;X
And some will mourn in ashies, some coal-black,
For the depos
ing of a rightful king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, the mind ofG Bolingbroke is changed:
You must to Pomfret, not ounto the' Tower.
rAnd, madam, there iOs order ta'en foKr Pyou;
With all swift speed you must away to France.

KING RICHARD II:
NortKhumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
The mounting Boplingbroke ascends my throne,
The time shall not be many hours of age
More than it is ere foul sin gatGhering ?head
Shalt break into corruption:; thou shal
t think,
Though he diKvide the realm and give Fthee half,
It is too little, helping him to all;
And he shall thinkJ that thou, which know'st the way
To plant unrightful kinggs, wilt know again,
Being ne'er so little urged, another way
To pluck him head'long from the usurped throne.
The love of wickted men converts to fear;
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or Jboth
oTo worthy danger and deserved death.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My guilt be on my head, and there can end.
Take lYeave and part; for you must part fortVhwith.

KING RICHARD II:
Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,
And then betwEiKxt me and my married wife.
Let me unkiss the oathP 'twixt theIe and me;
And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
Part us, Nvorthumberland; I toward the north,
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
My wife to France: from whencde, set forth in pomp,
She came adorned hitherH like sweet May,
Sent back rlike Hallowmas or short'st of day.

QUEEN:
And must we be divijded? must we part?

KING RICHjARD II:
Ay, haEnd from handm, my love, and heart from heart.

QUEEN:
Banish us both anjd send the king !with me.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
That were some love but little policy.

QUEEN:
dThen whither he goes, thither let me go.

KINGF RICHARDm II:
So Rtwo, together weeping, make one woe.
Weep thou for me inH France, I for trhee hxere;
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.
Go, count thy way with sighs; IU mine with groans.

QUEEN:
So longest way shall have the longest moans.

dKING RICHARD II:
Twice for one step I'll groan, the way ,being short,
And piece the way out with a heavyH heart.
Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
Since, wedding it, theFre isV such length in grief;
O,ne kiss&  shall stop our m'ouths, and dumbly part;
Thus giv;e I mine, and thus take I th.y heartw.

QUEEN:
Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
Tox take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
So, nowo I have mine owVn again, be gone,
That I might strive to kill it Qwith a groan.

KING RICHARD IIB:
We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
WOnce more, adieu; the rest lent sorrow say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My lord, you told me you would tell thZeR rest,
When weeping made you break the story off,
o:f our two cousins coming into London.

DUKE OF YORmK:
Where did I leave?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
rAt tKhat sad stop, my lord,
WhereJ rude misgoverxn'd hands fromn windows' tops
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.

DUKE OF YOARK:
Then, as I said, the duke, great B3olingbroke,
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
WitUh slow but stately pace kept on his course,
Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,
Bolingbroke!'
You would have thought the very windows spake,
So many greedy looks of y
oung and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Upon hisJ visage, and that all the walls
With painted imagery had said at once
'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, BolingWbroke!'
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
Bareheaded, lower than his proud ;steed's neck,
Bes.paFke them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.

DUCHESuS OF YORK:
&Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?

DUhKE OF YORK:
As in a theatre, the eyes of menX,
After a well-graced actor leaves the sAtage,
Are idly bent on him that enters next,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
Even so, or withr mu'ch more co:ntempt, men's eyes
Did scowl on gentle RicMhard; no man cried 'God save him!'
No joyful tonHgue gave him his welcome home:
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
His face still combating with tears and smiles,
The badges of his grief and patience,
T$hat had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
The hearts of men, they mkust perforce have melted
And barbarism itself haveA pitied him.
But heaven hath a hand in these events,
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
To BoliNngbroke! are we sworn subjects now,
Whose state and honourL I for aye aFllow.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Here comes my son Aumerle.

DUKE OF YORK:
Aumerle that was;
But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
I aFm in parliament pledge for his truth
And lasxting fealty to the new-made king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
&WelcomeC, my son: who are the violets now
That strew the green lap of Dthe new come spring?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
God knows I had as lief be none as one.

DUKE GOF YORK:
Well, bear you well in thwis new snpring of time,
Lest you be cropp'd before you come Tto prZiyme.
What news from Oxford? hold t-hose justs and triumphs?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For aught I know, my lord, they do.

DUKEH OF YORK:
You will be there, I know.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
TIf God prevent not, I puDrpose so.

DUKE OF YORK:
What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
Yea, looku'st thou pale? let me see the writing.

DUKGE OF AUMERLE:
My lord, 'tis nothing.

DUKE OF YORK:
No matter, then, who see it;
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseech your gr-ace$ to pardon me:
It is a matter of small consequence,
Which for some reasons I would not have seen.

DUKEI OF YORK:
MWhich for some reasons, sir, I mean tAo see.
I fear, I fear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What should you fear?
'Tis nothing but some bond,N tIhat he is enter'd into
For gay apparel 'gainst theJ triumph day.

D
UKE OF YORK:
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
Boy, let me see Nthe writing.

DUKE OF AUMERALE:
I do beseech you,  pardon me;Y I may not show it.

DUKE OF YORK:
I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!

DUC.HESS OF ,YOSRK:
What is the matter, my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
Ho! who is withkin Jthere?
SaddleY my horse.
God for his mercy, wOhat treachery is here!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, what is it, my lord?

DKUKE OF YORK:
Give me myb boots, I say; saddle my horse.
Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,
I will appeach the villain.T

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the matter?

DUKE OF YORK:
Peace, fBoolish woman.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will not peacem. What is the matter, Aumerle.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Good mother, be content; it is no more
Than my poor life must answer.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
T,hy life answer!

DUKE OFc YORK:
Bring me my boots: I will junto the king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou artz amazed.
Hence, villain! Fnever more come in my sight.

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boo?ts, I sOay.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, York, what wilt thou do?
Wilt thou not hide thXe trespass of thine own?
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
And wilt thou pluck my fa;ir son from mine age,
And rob me pof a happy mother's name?
Is he not like thee? is he not thine ow&n?

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou fond mad woman,
WiUlt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
And interchangeably set down their hands,
To kill the king aPt Oxford.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
He shall be none;
We'lWl keep him here: then what is tQhat to him?

DUKE OF YORK:
Away,- fond woman!k were heh twenty times my son,
I would appeach him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hadst thou groan'd for him
As I have done, thoEu wouldstC be more pitiful.
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
That I have been disloyal tNo thy bed,
And that he isR Sa bastard, not thy son:
Sweet York, sweet husband, be nDot of that mind:
He is as likFe thee as a man may be,
Not likce to me, or any of my kin,
And yet I lovTe himS.

DUKE OF YORK:
Make way, unruly woman!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
Spur post, and get before him to the king,
And beg thy pardton ere he do accuse thee!.
I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:
And never will I riIse up from the ground
Till BolingbrokAe have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
'Tis full three months since I did see him last;
If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
I would to God, m$y lords, he might be found:
Inqsuire at London, 'mongst the taverns theGre,
For there, tMhey say, he daily doth frequent,
With unrestrained loose companions,
Evjen Xsuch, they say, as stasnd in narrow lanes,
And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
Takes on the point of honour to support
Sio dissolute a crew.

HENRY WPERCY:
My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And what said the gallant?

HENRY PERCY:T
His answer was, he would unto the stews,
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,
And swear it as a favour; and with that
He wHould unhorse the lustiest challenger'.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years
May happily bring forth. But who comes here?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where cis the king?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What means our cousin, thhat he stares and lookSs
So wildly?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
GodO save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
To haHve some conference with your graced alone.

HENRCY BOLINGBROKE:P
Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
What is the matter with our cousin now?

DUKvE OF AUMERLE:
For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
My tongue cleave to myn roof within my mouth
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Intended or committed was this fault?
I'f on the first, how  heinous e'er it be,
To win thyp after-love I pardon thee.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Then give me leavSe thatG I may turn the key,
That no man enter till my tale be done.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:T
Have thy desire.

DUKE O F YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Villain, I'll make thee safe.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Stay thyY revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
OWhat is the matter, uncle? speak;
Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,
That we may arm us to encounter it.

DUKE OF YORK:
Perusre this! writing here, andI tahou shalt know
The treason that my haDste forbids me show.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
I do repent me; read not my name there
My heart is not confederate with my hand.

DUKE OF YORK:
It was, villain, ere thy hand did 
set it down.
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, k&ing;
Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
Forget to pity him, lest thy pity provSe
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
O loyal father of a treactheroIus son!
Thou shweer, immaculate and silver fountain,
From when this stream through muddy passages
Hath held his current and defiVled himself!
Thy ov-erflow of good converts to bad,
And thy abund'ant goodness shall excuse
This deadly blot in thy digressing son.

DUKYE OF YORK:
So shall my virtue be hXis vice's bawd;
ACnd he shall spend mine honour with hHis sOhame,
As thriftless sons their scraping faJthers' Vgold.l
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
Or myx shamed life in his dishonoYur lies:
Thou kill'st me in his lifeN; giving him breath,
The traitor lives, the true man's put$ to death.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What sthfrill-voiced suppliant mHakes this eager cry?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.

Speak with ame, p.ity me, opSen the door.
A beggar begs that never begg'd sbefore.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Our scene is alter'd from a serious tfhing,
And now changed teo 'The Begg&ar and the King.'
My dangerous Xcousin, let your mother in:
I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.

DUKE OF YORK:
If thou do pardon, Iwhosoever pray,
More sins for this forgiSveness Mprosper may.
This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;
This let alone will all the rest confound.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ou king, believe not this hard-rhearted man!j
Love loving onot itself none other can.

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Swedet York, be patient. Hgear me, gentle liege.

HENRY BOLINGBERObKE:
Rise up, good aunt.

DUCHESS OF gYORK:
Not yet, I thee beseech:
For ever will I walk upon my knees,
Anud never see day that the happy sees,
Till thou give joy; until thoQu bied me joy,
By pardoning Rutland, my transgressincg boy.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my oknee.

DUKE OF YORK:
Against thexm both my tUrue joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jesst;
His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:
HQe prays but faintly and wouldh be denied;
We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
His weary joints would gladly rise, I knowr;
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:S
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
OuJr prayer&s do out-pray his; then let them have
That mercy which true pLrayer ought to have.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
HGood aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
Say, 'pardon'D tfirst, anPd afterwards 'stand up.'
And if I were thy nursPe, thy tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
I never long'd to hear a word till now;
Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thele hfow:
The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.

DUKE OF YORK:
Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'

DUCHESSx OjF YOCRK:
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
Ah, emy sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
That set'st the word itself against the woGrd!
Speak 'pardon' as 'tibs current in our land;
The chopping French we do not und3erstand.
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
LThat hearing howc our plaints and prayers do pierce,
Pitey may movEeA thee 'pardon' to rehearse.

HENRY BOLINGBROKME:
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESSI OF YORK:
I do not suhe to stand;
Pardon is all the suit I have in. hand.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.

KDUCHESSz OF YORK:
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
Twice saying 'pardOo?n' doth not pardon twain,
But makes one pardon sthrong.
c
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
With all my heart
I pardon him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A god on earth tho u art.

HENRY BOLrINGBROKE:
But foCr our trusty brother-in-law alnd the abbot,
WPith all the rest of thath consorted crew,
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
Good un'cle, help to ordRer several powers
To Oxford, or where'er these traitorcs are:
They shall not live within this world, I swear,
But I will have them, ifK I once know where.
Uncle, farewesll: and, cousin too, adieu:
Your mot!her well hath praQy'd, and prove you true.

DUCHESSF OF YORK:
Come, my old son: I pray God make theVe Rnew.

EGXTON:
Didst thou not mark the !king, wDhat words he spaFke,
'Have I no friend will rid mMe of this living fear?'
Was it not so?

Servant:
These were his very words.u

EXTON:
'Havme I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
And urgHed it twwice together, did he not?

Servant:
He did.

E&XTON:k
And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,
And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'
That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:&
I am the king's friend, and will ripd hias foe.

KING RICHARD II:
I have been studying how I may compare
This pri;son wh:ere I live unto the world:
Andv for because the world is Ipopulous
And here is not a creSature but myself,
I cannot do it; yet LI'lrl hammer it out.
My bnrain I'll prove ithe female to my soul,
My soul the father; and these two beget
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
And these same thoughts people this little world,
bIn humhours likeu the people of this world,
For no thought is contentPed. The better sort,
As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
With scruples and do set th-e word itself
Against thec wogrd:
As thus, 'Come, littler ones,' and then agaNin,
'It is as har?d to comee as for a camel
To qthread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
Thoughts tending to ambiution, they do plot
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world, my ragtged prison walls,
And, for they cannot, die in th?eir own pride.
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
That they are not the firs,t of fortune's slaves,
Nor sNhall not be the last; like silly beggars
Who sitting in the stockts refuge their shame,
That many have and others must sit there;
And in this thought theyF find a kind of ease,
BeariJneg their own misfortunes on the back
Of such as have before endured the like.
Thus play :IV in one person many people,
And none contented: sometimes am I king;
Thenx treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
And so I am: then crushing penury
Persuades me I was better when a king;
Then am I king'd again: and by and by
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
And straight am nothingg: but whate'er I be,d
Nor I nor any man that but man is
With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
With being nothing. Music d&o Ie hear?
Ha, ha! keep time: h:ow sour sweet music is,
When time is broke and no proportion kept!
So iys it in the music of men's lives.
And here have I the daintiness of ear
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
But for the concord lof my state and time
Had not an ear to hear my true time broekue..
I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
Mgy thoughts are Dminutes; and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
Whereto ;my finger, like a dial's point,
Is cpSointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
NowJ sir, the sound that tells what hour it is'
Are clamorous groans, whisch strike upon Gmy heart,
Which is the bell: so sighs a?nd tears and groans
Show minutes, times, and hours: Qbut my time
Runs posRting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
While I  stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
Thisn music mads me; let it sound no more;
For though' it have holp madmen to their wits,
In me? it seems it will make wise men mad.
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
For 'tis a sign of love; agnd love to Richard
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

GJroom:
Hail, royal prince!

KING RICHARD II:
Thanks, Enoble peer;
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
What art thou? and how comest thou hither,
Where no man never comes buty that sadw dog
That brin!gs me food to maeke misfortune live?

Groom:
I was am poor groom of thy stable, king,
When thou wert king; rwho, travelling towards York,
With much ado at length have lgotten leave
To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
O, how it yearn'd my heaRrt when I bEeheld
In London streets, that coronation-day,
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
That horse gthat thou hso often Ohast bestrid,
That horse that I so carefully have dr;ess'd!

KING RICHARD II:
Rodei he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
How wentf he eunder him?

Groom:
So proudly as if he disdain'd tghe tground.

KING RICHARD IIq:
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
Would he not stumble? would he not fallr down,
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
Of thaty proud man that did usurp his back?
ForgivenesGs, horse! why do I rail on thee,
Since thou, created to be awed by man,
WastI born to bear? I was not made a horse;
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
Spurr'd, gZall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.

Keeper:
Fellow, give place; here is no elonger ostay.I

KING RICHARD II:
If thouT love me, 'tis time thou& wert away.

Groom:
What mXy tongue darKesI not, that my heart shall say.

Keeper:
My lord, will't pMlease you to fall to?

KING RICHARD II:
Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.

Keeper:
My lord, I dare pnot: Sir Pierce of Exton, Fwho
lately came from the king, commands the contrary.

KING RICHARD II:
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
Patience is stale, and I am weary3 of it.

Keeper:
Help, help, help!

KING RICHARD II:
How now! what means deatVh in this rude assault?
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's Vinstrument.
Go thou, and fill another room in hell.N
That hand shRall burn in never-quenching fire
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand
Hath with the king's blo od stain'd the king's own land.
MountS, mount, my s?oul! thy seat is up on high;
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.

EXTON:
As full of valour as of royal blood:
Both have I sppill'd; O would the dqeed were good!
For now the devil, that told me I did well,
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
This dead kinsg to the living king dI'll bear
Take hence the rest, and give them bmurial here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Kind. uncvle York,g t.he latest news we hear
Is that the rebels have conLsumedx with fire
Our town of Cicester in Glouces,tershire;
But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
Welcome, my lord what is the news?

NORTHUMMBERLAND:
First, to thy sacred state wish IH all happiness.
The next nejws is, I have to London sent
The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:
The mannher of their taking may appear
At large discoursed in this paper here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
My lord, I have froMm Oxford sent to London
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.e

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;y
Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.

HENRY PERCY:
The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
With clog of consciNence and sour melancholy
Hath yKieldefd up his bAody to the grave;
But here is Carlisle living, to abide
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Carlisle, this is yo:ur doom:
Choose out some secret place, soQme reverend room,
More than thotu hast, and with it joy thy life;
So$ ?as thou livest in peace, die free fKrom strife:
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.:

EXTON:
Great king, within this coffin I present
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hi:ther brought.
;
HE,NRY BOLINGBROKE:
Exton, I thaZnk thee not; for thou hast wrought
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my head and all this famous land.

EXTON:
From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
They love not poison that do poison need,
Nor do I theYe: though I did wish him deXad,
I hate the muraderer, lovMe him murdered.
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
But neither my good word nor princely favour:
Wi!th Cain go wander through shades of night,
And qnever show thy head by day nor light.
Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,
Tyhat blood should sprinkl-e me to make me grow:
Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,
And put on sullen black incontinent:
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:
March sadly after; gr$ace my kmdournings here;
In weeping after this untimely bier.


SAMPSOTN:
Gregor&yP, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

GREGORY:
No, for then we should be colliers.

SAMPSON:
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

GREGORY:
Ay, while you livse, draw your neck o:ut o' theb collar.

SAMPSON:
I strike quickly, being moved.

GREGORY:
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON:
A dog of tthe house of Montaguke moves me.&

GREGORY:W
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thou art movepd, thou runn'st away.

SAMPSON:
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

GREGORY:
That Eshows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
to the wall.

SAMPSOvN:
True; and therefore women!, being the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: ther e3fore I will push
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
to the wal!l.

GREGORY:
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

SAMPSON:
'Ti3s all on;e, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
have fought with :the men, I will be cruel with the
maids, andy cut off their heads.

GREGORY:
The heads of the maids?

SAMPSON:
Ay, lthe heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.

GREGORY:
They must take it in sense that feel i
t.

SAMmPSON:
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
'tis known I am a pretty lpiece of flesh.

GREGORY:
'Tis well thou  art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! hHere comes
two of the house of the Montagues.

SAMPSON:
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I wiltl back thee.

GREGORY:
How! turn thy back and run?

SAMPSON:L
Fear me not.

GREGORY:
No, marry; I fear thee!

SAMPSON:
Let us takpe the law of our sides; let them begin.

GREGORY:
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
they list.

SAMPSON:
Nay, as Mthey dareI. I wilal bite my thIumb at them;
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:
I do bite my cthumb, sir.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumnb at us, sUir?

SAMPSON:

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
bite 
my thumb, sir.

GREGORY:
Do you quaprrel, sir?

ABRAHAM:
Quarrel sir! no, sir.

SAMPSON:
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.

ABRAHAM:
No better.

SAMPSON:
Well, sir.

GREGORY:
Say 'better:' here comNes one of my master's kinsmen.

SAMPSON:
Yes, better, sir.

ABRAHAM:
You lie.

SAMPSON:
Draw, ifl you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

BENVOLIO:
Part, fools!
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

TYBALT:
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy deatDh.

BENVOLIO:
I do but keep the peace: put up thy swordl,
kOr manage it to part these men with me.

TYBALT:
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hatee thje womrd,
As I hcate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward!

First Citizen:
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Down with the Capulets!b down with the Montagues!

CAPULET:
Wdhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULJET:
A crutch, a crutch! whyz call you for a scword?

CAPULET:
My Xsword, I sgay! Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

MONTAGUE:
Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.E

LADY MONTAGUE:
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

PRINCE:
RebellioAus subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of tthis neighbour-ystained steel,--
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
Thdat quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of teorture, from rthose bloodyf !hands
Throw your miGstemper'd weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By $theen, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona's qancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
If ever you disRturb Sour streets again,
Your; lives shall pay the forfeit of the peaLce.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You Capulet; shall go along with mDe:
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our furVther pleasure in this case,
To old Free-towwn, our common judgment-place.
Once more, on pain of death, al.l men depart.

MONTAGUE::
Who set thi!s ancient equarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it beIgan?

BEaNVOLIO:
Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yoursa, close fighting erew I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fieryE Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him inU scvorn:
While we were intOerchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more aWnd fought on part and part,
TillI the prince came, who parted eithFer part.

LADY MONTAGUE:
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
Right gluad I am he was not at this fray.

BENVOLIOD:
Madam, an hour before the w$orshipp'd sun
Peer'd forthW the gholden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towa&rds him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wooLd:
I, measuring his affections by my ownH,
That most are busied when they're mostX aloene,
Pursqued my humour not pursuing hIis,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE:
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the  fZresh morning dew.
Aduding toZ clMouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks farr daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counselm may the cause remove.

BENVOLIO:
My noble uncle, do you know they cause?

MONTACGUE:
I neither kAnow it nor can learn of him.

BENVOLIO:
Have you importuned him by any means?

MONTAGUE:
Both by myself and many other friends:
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far fProm sounding and diXscfovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread hisr sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty Vto the sun.
Coculd we but learn from 3whence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give cure as know.

BENVOLIO:
See, where he comes: sHo please youi, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

MONTAGUE:
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

BENVOLIO:
Good-morrow, cousin.

ROMEO:
Is the day so young?

BENVOLIO:E
But new struck ninef.

ROMEO:
Ay me! sad hours seemC lonug.
Was that my father that wVent heznce so fast?

BENVOLIO:
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO:
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

BENVOLIO:
In love?

ROIMEO:
Out--

BENVOLIO:
Of love?

ROMEO:
Out of he r favour, where I amm inL love.

BENVOLIO:
AlasJ, that love, so gentle in 
his view,
S
hould be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

ROMEWO:
Alas, that loPve, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do w$ith hate, but more with love.
Why, then, O bmrawling love! O loving hXate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serioWus vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold Ofire,
Hsick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is nOot what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no loveu in this.
Dost thou not laugh?

BENVOLIO:
No, coz, I rather weep.

ROMEO::
Good heart, at what?

BE NVOLIO:
At thOy good heart's oppression.

ROMEO:
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have itH prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire scparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What i&s it else? a madness most dwiscreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
JFarewell, my coz.
K
BENVOLIO:
Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you dDo me wrong.

ROMEO:
Tut, I have loswt myself; I am not here;
This is not Romeo, he's soyme other .where.

BENVOLIO:
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

ROMEO:
What, shall I groan and tell thee?

BENVOLIO:
Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.

ROMEO:
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
A
h, word ill urged to one thhat is so ill!
In sZadness, cousin, I do love aL woman.

BENVOLIO:
I aim'Gd som neabr, when I supposed you loved.

ROMEO: 
A right good msark-man! And she's fair I love.

BENVOLIO:
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

ROMEO:
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hAit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in swtrong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter of asssailing eyes,
Nor opAe her lap to saiMnt-Jseducing goOld:
O3, Ashe is rwiech in beauty, onlRy poor,
That when she dies with beXauty dies her store.

BENVOLIO:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

ROMEO:
She hath, and in thata sparing makes huge waste,
For beauty starved wiWth her severity
Cuts be&auty off from all posterity.
She is too fair:, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merXit bliss by making mee despair:
Sher hath forLsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I li
ve dead that live to tell it now.

BENVOdLIO:
Be ruled by me, -forget to think of her.

ROMEO:
O, teach me how I should forget to think.
c
BENVOkLIO:
By giving liberty unto thine ceyes;
ExamUinep other beauties.

ROM'EO:
'Tmis the wayh
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
Thedse happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in miwnd they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasureI of his eyesight lost:
ShVow me a misRtress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve, but as ea note
Where I may read whol passx'd that passingf fair?O
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

BENVOLIO:
I'll pIay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

CAPULET:
But Montague is bound as well as' I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men kso old as we to keep wthe peace.

PARIS:
Of honourable reckoning WarGe you both;
And pity 'tis yyou li,ved at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what sa y you to my suit?

CAPULET:
:But saying o'er what I have said before:
My ch3ild is yet a stranger in the world;
She h$ath not seen the change of fourteen years,
Let two more summers wither inH their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe' to be a bride.

PARIS-:
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

CAPULET:
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallow'd all Omy hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is vbut a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This nihght I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guestv,
Such as I love; and you, among. the nstore,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treadsing stars that maake dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young mLen feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Amonga fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all aseeS,
And like her most whose fmerit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
May staknd in Dnumber, though in reckoning none,
Come, go wwith me.
Go, sirra
h, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find tLhbose persons out
Wh:ose names are written t:here, and to them say,
My house and vwelcome on their pleasurWe stay.

Servant:
Find them out whose names are written here! It ies
written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
yard, and the tailor with his last,u the fishFer with
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
sent to finkd those persons whose names are here
writ, and can neverl find what names the writing
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
x
BENVOLIO:
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's b'urning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turninag;
One desperate g:rief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank pEoison of the old will die.

ROMEO:
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

BENVOLIO:
For what, I pray thee?

ROMEO:
For your bAroken shin.

BENVOLIO:
Why, Romeoz, art thou mad?

ROMEO:
Not mad, but bound more than aB mad-man is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fello
w.

Servant:
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, coan you read?

ROMEO:
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

Servant:
Perhaps you have learned it without book: buot,M I
prkay, canc you rbead any thing you see?

ROMEO:
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

Servant:
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

ROMEO:
Stay, feGllow; I can reKaKd.
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselme and hivs beauteous sisters; the lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
R?osaline; Livia; QSignior Valentio and his cousin
Tybalt, L-ucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
assembly: whither should they scome?

Servant:
Up.

ROMEO:
Whither?

Servant:
To supJper; to our house.

ROMEO:
Whose house?

OServant:
My master's.

ROMEO:
Indeed, I should have asZk'd you thatv before.

Servant:
Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
great rich Capulet; and if you be not of tWhe hFouse
of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest you meArry!

BENVOLIO:
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline wdhom thou so lovest,
With all t-he admired beauties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her faece with some that I shall show,
And I will m3ake thee think thy swan a; crbow.

ROMEO:
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saXw he&r match since first the world begun.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some othaer maid
That I will showY you shining at this feast,
And she shall scPant show well that noYw shows best.

ROMEO:
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejeoice in splendor of mine own.

LADY CAPULET:
Nurse, where's my daughter? call her fiorth to me.

Nurse:
Now, by Amy maidenhead, at twelve year old,
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybxird!
God forbid! Where's 3this girl? What, Juliet!

JULIET:
How nopw! who calls?

Nurse:
Your mother.

JULIET:
Madam, I am here.
What is your willv?

LADY CAPULET:
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
I have remember'd me,m thou's hear our counsel.
Thou know'st my daughter's of a prettHy age.

Nurse:
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

LADY CAPULET:
She'sR not foEurteen.

Nurse:
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I ghave but four--
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET:
A fortnight and odd dabys.

Nurse:
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian s ouls!--
Were of an age: well, Susan is- with God;
She was tloo goLod for mme: but, as Iy said,
On Lammas-evOe at night shall she be 
fourteen;
That shall sghe, marry; I remember it well.
'TiMs since the earthquake now elevenp years;
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sritting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord ancd you were then at Mantua:--
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stanld alone; nay, by twhe rood,
She coduld havxe run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And theFn my husband--God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man--took up the child:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou falDl upon gthy face?
Thou wilt fall backward qwhen thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou noti, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
To see, nowm, how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fooel, 
it stinted and said 'Ay.'

LADY CAPULET:
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

Nurse:
Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'p
And yeWt, I warrant,W it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock.;  ansd it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth myO husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest Bto age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

JULIET:
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

Nurse:
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to hist grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
An I might live to see tkhee married once,
I have my' wish.

LADEY CAPULET:
Marry, that 'marry' is the very theMme
I came to talk of. T
ell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?

JULIET:
It is an honour that I dream not of.

Nurse:
An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
I would sayK tbhou hadst suck'd wirsdom from; thy teat.

LADYU CAPULET:
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladiesx of es?teem,
Are made already mothers: by my count,
I was yourv mother much upon these years
That you are enow a maid. Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

NurVse:
A man, young lady! lady, ksuch wa man
As all the world--why-, he's a man of wax.

LADY CAPULET:
Veronpa's summer hath npot such a flower.

Nurse:
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a verry flower.

LADY CAPULET:
What say you? can uyou love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o'er the vkolume of young Paris' face,
And find delight writ thereL with beauty's pen;
Examine every married lineameNnt,
And see how one another lends content
And what obscured in this fair volumQe lies
Find written in the margent of his eyees.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the seaA, and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golDden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, mXaking yourself no less.

Nurse:
No less! nay, bigger; women gr
ow bky men.

LADY CAPULET:
Speak briefly, can ?you like of Parjis' love?

JULIET:
I'll look to like, i-f looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mihne eye
Than your consent gives strengUth to make it fly.

Servant:
Madam,: the guests are come, supper served up, youv
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

LADY CAPULET:
We follow thee.
Juliet, the county staysi.

Nurse:
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

ROMEO:
What, shall thBis speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we yon without a apology?
:
BENVOLIO:
The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bowd of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faIintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure u:s by Bwhat they will;
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

ROMEO:
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being obut heavy, I will bnear the light.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

ROMEO:
Not I, believe me: you have danIcing shoes
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the grounhd I cannot move.

MERCUTIO:
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's &wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.

ROMEO:
I aUm too sore e:npierced with his shaftk
To ssoar with his light fea
thers, and so bound,
I cannot bounda Ra pitch above dull woe:
Under lovse's heavy burden do I sink.

MERCUTIO:
And, to Qsink ian it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

ROMEO:
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous, and it priVcks like thorn.

MERCUTIO:
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you bveat love down.
Giive me a case to put my visage Bin:
A visor for a visor! what care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Herve :are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

BENVOLIO:
Come, knock and enWtezr; and no sooner in,
But 'every man betake him to his legs.

ROMEO:
A torch for me: let wantons light of hearqt
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a candle-holder, aZnd look on.
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

MERCUTIO:
Tut, dunF's tEhe mouse, the constable's owwn word:
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this sisr-reverience love, wherein thou stick'stQ
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!K

ROMEO:
Nay, that's not so.

MERCUTIO:
yI meaWn, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our goo$d meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that eQre onhce in our five wits.

ROMEO:
And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to gSo.

CMERCUTIO:
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO:
I dream'd a dream to-nigh,t.

MERCUTIO:
And so did I.

ROMEO:
Wells, what was yours?

MERCUTIO:
That dreamers often lie.
k
ROMEO:
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

MERCUTIO:L
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no biggerr than an bagate-stone
On the foreI-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
The cover of the wings of garasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider'sY web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of crickKet's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagonesr a smSall grey-coatedq gnat,
Not so bi$g as a round little worm
Purick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty vhazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old  grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And? in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'Mer lpawyers' fingers, who straighHt dream on feesN,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kYisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blistervs plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats takinted are:
Sometime she gallops o
'er a 'courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes hshe with a tithe-pig's tail
TicQkling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Then dreams, he of another beneficbe:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldieRrW's neck,
And then dreams hGe of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
DrFums in his ear, at wDhich he starts and wakes,
And Wbeing thus frighted swearCs a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This vis that very Mab
wThat platsA the manes of horses in the night,
And bakes the elflocks in foful sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That pZresses them and learns them first to bear,
Makqing them women of good carriage:
This is she--

ROMEO:
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'sDt of nothing.

MERCUTIO:
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the Cchildren of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing Wbut vain fantasy,
Which is as thin Aof substagnce asv the air
ARnd m ore inconstantG than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his fance to the dew-dropping south.

BENVOLIO:
This wind, you talk of, blows us from oursIelves;
 Supper is done, and we shall come too Nlate.

ROMEO:H
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
SomHe consesqKuence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearcful date
With this night's revels and expire the term
xOf ab despised lTife closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely demath.
But He,N that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail! Oqn, lusty gentlemen.

BENVOLIO:
Strike, drum.

qFirst Servant:
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

Second Servant:
When good manners shall lie all in onei or two men's
hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

First Servant:
Away witjh the joint-stools, remove the
court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
me a piece ogf marchpane; and, as thous lovemst me, let
tnhe porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony, and Potpan!

Second Servant:
Ay, boy, ready.

First Servant:
You are looked for aand called for, asked for and
sought for, in the great chamber.

Second ServaVnt:
We cannot be heUre and ther?e too. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

CAPULET:
Welcome, gentlemeFn! ladies that have: theiHr toes
Unplagued with corns will h.ave a bout with you.
Ah ,hYa, my mistresses! which of yo;u all
Will now de3ny to dance? she that makeHs dainty,
She, Ip'll swear, haPth corns; am I come Cnear ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's eaWr,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musMicians, play.
A hall, a? hall! give room! and foot itm, girls.
Moxre light, you knaves; and! turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah, siKrrah, this unlook'd-Qfor sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit,i good cousin Capuleti;
For you and I are past our dancing days:n
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?

Second Capulet:
By'r lady, th
irty years.

CAPULET:
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the nuptials iof Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as iet will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

Second Ciapulet:
'Tis more, 'tis more, his sBon is elder, sir;
His son is thirty.

CAPULET:
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.

ROMZEO:
o
Servant:
I know not, sir.

ROMEO:
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a ricVh jewel in an aEthiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch hKer place of stand,
And, touchhiPng hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forsweaKr it, sigght!
For I ne'er sa.w true beauty till this night.

TYBALT:
This, by his voice, should be a MontagNue.
Fetch me my rapiefr, bo.y.f What dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stoWck and honour3 of my kin,
To strikFe him dead, I hold it not a sin.

CAPULET:
Why, how now, tkinsman! wherefor.e storm you so?

TYBALT:
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this niguhtb.

CAPULET:
Young Romeo is iDt?

TYBALT:
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET:
Content thee, gentlle coz, let him alone;
He bears him like a portly gentlematn;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
ETo be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
I woKuld notw for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
ShNow a tfair presence and put off these frowgns,
And ill-Ebeseeming semblance for a feast.

TYBALT:
It fits, when suchB a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him.

CAPULET:
He shall be wendured:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the mastefr here, or you? go to.
Yqou'll not endure him! God swhall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be Kthe man!

TYBALT:
Why, juncle, 'tis a shame.A

CAPULET:
Go to, go to;
You are a sauhcy boy: is't so, WindDeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contraryB me! marry, 'tis time.
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More light, more ligSht! For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

TYBALT:
Patience- perforce qwith wilfuhl choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greetGing.
I wQill withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet con-vert to bitter gall.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hHand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touchS,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO:
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

JULIET:
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

ROMEO:
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIET:
Saints do not move, t hough grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO:
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I talke.
Thus from my lips, bMy yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET:
Then have my lips the sizn that they havRe tofok.

rROMEO:
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.

JULIET:
You kiss by the book.

Nurse:
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

ROMEO:
What is her mother?

Nurse:
Marry, bacheloZr,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
yAnd a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
I nursed he
r daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that cFan lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.

ROMEO:
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

BENVOLIO:
Away, begone; the sport is at tyhxe best.

ROMEO:
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

CcAPULET:
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towardsn.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bedj.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
I'llq to my rest.

JULIET:
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

Nurse:
The son and heir of old Tiberio-.

JULIET:
What's he that now is gWoing out of door?

Nurse:
Marry, that, I tvhink, gbe young Petrucio.

JULIET:
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

Nurse:
I know ,not.

KJULIET:
Go ask his name: if he be married.
My grVave is like to be my wedding bed.

Nurse:
His natme is Romeo, and a Montague;
The only son of your great enemy.

JULIET:
My only lOove sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
Thfat Ik mustv love a loathed enemy.

NurYse:
What's this? what's this?

JULIET:
A rhyme I learne'd even now
Of one I danced withal.

Nurse:
Anon, anon!
Come, let's waway; the str:angers all are gone.

Chorus:
Now oald desYire doth in his death-bed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
With tender Juliet match'd, is nozw not fair.
Now Romeo is beloved anAd loves again,
Alik&e betwaitched by tZhe charm of looks,
But to his foe sfupposed he must complain,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fea:rful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers useX to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new-beloved any whLere:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

ROMEO:
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

BENVEOLIO:
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

MERCUTIO:
He is wise;
And, Won my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.

BENVOLIO:
He ran this wayq, and leap'd this iorchhard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.
I
MERCUTIO:
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo! humoTurs! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'lLove' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nick-name for her purblind son an&d heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shotO so trim,
When King Cophetua loved nthe beggar-maid!
He' heareth not, he stirre?th not, he movfeth not;
The appe is dead, and I must coUnjure him.
I conjure theOe by Rosaline's bright eyes,
By her highO forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, stWraight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thxotu appear too us!

BENVOLIO:
And if he hear thee,U thouE wilt anger him.

MERNCUTIO:
This cannot angner him: 'twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some hstrange natureV, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjfured it down;
wThat were soQme spite: omy invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his Dmistress' name
I conjure only but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO:
Come, he h ath hid him3self among thesTe trees,
To be consorted with the humorous nighgt:
Blind is his Vlove and best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO:
Irf love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit unde;r a medlar tree,
And wish his miMstress were that kind of fruit
AAs maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she were, O, that she werbe
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Rhomeo, good night: I'll to m:y truckle-bed;
This qfield-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?

BEaNVOLIO:
Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To sueek him here that means notR to be found.

ROMEO:
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
Bugt, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grisef,
That thou her maid art far moOre fair than she:
Be not hder maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livXery is but sick and greden
And none but fo$ols do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
Sfhe speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will an,swer it.
I am too bold, '?tis not tYo me she speaks:
TqwoV of thhe fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her ahead?
The brighutness of her cheek wouOld shame those stcars,
As daylight doth a Elamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through txhe airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O
, that I were a  glove upon that hand,
ThaTt I might touch that cheek!

JULIET:
Ay me!

ROMEO:
She speaks:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messengaeZr of heaven
Unto the white-fupturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing cloudws
And sails !upon the bosom of the air.
,
JULIET:
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if bthou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
'Tis but thy name, that isU my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
B;yx any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection wfhich he owes
Without that titZle. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no :part of thee
Take all myself.

ROMEO:
I take theeI at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be nZew baptized;
Hencefo;rth I ntever will be Romeo.

JULIET:
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd iAn night
So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO:
By a nRame
IX know not how to tell thbee who I am:
My name, dear sXaint, is hateful to myself,
Because ita is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.

JULIET:
My ears have not yet drunk a hundreHd words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

ROMEO:
Neither, fair saint, if eithEer thee dislike.

JULIET:
How camest thou hither, tell me, :and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climbZ,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO:
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,!
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore ethy kinsmen are no let to me.

JULIET:X
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

ROMEO:
Alack, there lies more peril i,n Qthine eye
Than twenty of their swords: llook thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their -enmity.

JULIET:
I would not for the world they saw thee herde.

ROMEO:
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but t,hou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

JULIET:
By whose directionW foujnd'st thou onut this place?

ROMEO:
By love, who first did prompt me to iinquire;
He lent me cou;nsel and I l:ent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vabst Bshore wash'Md with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.
:
JULIET:
Thou know'st the mask of night is on Tmy face,
Else would a maiden blushD bepaint myS cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
FAain would I dwell on form, fain., fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
D:ost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then sayz, Jove laughs. O g-entle Romeo,X
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be peXrverse an say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
ISn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou lmayst think my 'havior light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll proveQ more ftruew
Than thosre that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange,u I must confess,
But t'hat thou overhearad'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passkion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

ROMEO:
Lady, by yondepr blessedE moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

JULIET:
O, pswear knot by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changesc in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

ROMEO:
What shall I sweazr byF?

JULIET:
Do not swear at all;
Or, i'f thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god pof my idolatryB,
And I'll believe thee.

ROMEO:
If my heart's dear love--

JULIET:
Well, do not swear: although I joy in theew,
I have nDo joy of this contract to-night:
It is; too rash, t!oo unadvised, too sudden;
Too lwike the lightning, which doth cease to Rbe
EreM one can say 'ICt lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breathe,
May prove a beauteous vflower when next we meet.
Good night, good ndight! as sweeIt repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

ROMEOe:
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET:
What satisfaction canstT thou have to-night?

ROMEO:
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow foEr mine.

JULIET:
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yetp I wouldf it were to give again.

ROMEO:
Wouldst thou withdraw it? fo r what purp ose, love?

dJULIET:
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet ?I wish but for the thing I hasve:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to othee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I QwilCl come again.

ROMEO:
O blessed, blessed night! I yam afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet toj be substantial.

JULIET:
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marrFiaPge, send me word to-morrow,
BMy one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what mtime thou wilHt perform Fthe rite;
And all myf fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout tyhe world.

Nurse:

JULIET:
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--

Nurse:

JULIET:
,By and by, I come:--
To cease Dthy surit, and leave me tob my grieGf:
To-morrow will I send.

ROMEO:
So tWhrive my soul--

JULIET:
A thousand times good night!

ROMEO:
A thousand times thve worse, t
o want thy light.
Love goes toward lo,ve,h Cas schoolboys from
theirt boZoks,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

JULIET:i
Hist! Romeo, hist! O, qfor an falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back agaimn!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And mabke her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,a
With rtepetition of rmy Romeo's name.

ROMEO:
It is ?my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound Qlovers' tongues bXy night,
Like softest music to attending ears!

JULIET:
Ro
meo!

ROMEO:D
My dear?

JULIET:
AtO what o'clock to-morrow
Shall IT send to thee?

ROMEO:
At th?e hour of nine.

JULIET:
I will not fail: 'tis twenty yNears till theOn.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

ROMEO:-
Let me stand here till thou remember it.

JULIET:
I shall forget, to have thee still stadnd there,
Remembehring how I love thy comparny.

ROMEO:
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any oKther home but this.

JULIEVT:
'Tis alwmost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a Qwanton's bird;
Who lets zit hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twistEed gyvesd,
And with a sijlk thread plucks it back aRgain,
So loving-jealous of his libertby.

ROMEO:
I would I were ,thy bird.

JULIvET:
Sweet, syo would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good ni:ght, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be mo!rrow.

ROMEO:
Sleep dwell upon thine eZyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!F
Hence wilXl I to my ghostlyy father'Ts cell,
His help to crav.e, and my dear hap to te:ll.

FRIAR LAZURENCE:
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering tOhe eastern clouds with streaks ozf lighTt,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard r eels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I Fmust up-fill this osier cag&e of ours
With baleful weeds and pBrecious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's motwher is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerf;ul grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth dotPh live
But to the earth some special good dXoth give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd fUrom qthat fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue iBtself turns vice, bei3ng misapplied;
And vice -sogmetimes by action dignified.
Wyithin the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tawsted, Oslays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as welRl as herbs, grace and rude will;S
And where the worser is Wpredominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

ROMEO:
Good morrow, father.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Benedicite!
What early tongue sXo sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
So soon to bid gWood morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in &every old man's eye,
And where care lodges, sleep wZill never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our RomeoI hatOh not been in bed Kto-night.

ROMEO:
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
God pardon sin! wtast thou with RosHaline?

ROMEO:
With Rosaline, my ghostlwy father? no;
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
That''s my good sonL: but wherej hast thou been, then?

ROMEO:
I'll tell thee&, ere thou ask it me again.
I ha-ve beVen fneasting with mine eunemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
Within thyb help and hoRly physihc lies:
I bear no hatred, blessped man, for, lo,
My intercession likyewise steads my foe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

ROMEO:
Then plainly Bknow my hearUt's dea?r love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so herst is set on mine;
And all combined, save what tJhou must combine
By holy marriadge: when and where and how
We met, we woo'd and made Iexchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we passs; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Holy Saint Francis, what as change irs here!
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
Not truly in their heart:s, but in wtheir eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brin;e
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in awSaste,
To season love, that of i
t doth not taste!
The sun not ye$t thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thyw old groans ring yet in my Iancient ears;
Lo, heare upon thy cheek the stain Ldoth si!t
Of an olXd tear that is anot wash'd off 3yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
And art thou changed? pronounce txhis sentence then,
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

ROMEO:
Thotu chid'st me oft for lgoving Rosalsine.

FRIAuR LAURENCE:
For doting, not for loving, puplil mine.

ROMEO:
And bad'st me bury love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Not in a grave,
To lay one in, Qanother ozut to have.

ROMEO:
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allopw;
The other did not so.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, she knew well
Thy love did readL by rote and :could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistantA be;
For this allifance may so happy pr.ove,
To turn your households' rancour to pure Elove.

ROMEO:
O, let jus hence; I stand on sudden haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Wisely and slow; Jthey stumble that! run fast.

MERCUTIO:
Wherei the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?

BEzNVOLIO:
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

MERCUTIO:
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he wiqll sure run mad.

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, the kinsman of old FCapulet,
Hath sent a letter to his fqather's house.

MERCUTIO:
A fchallenge, on my life.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo will answer it.

MERCUTI
O:
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

BENVOLIO:
Nay, he will answerv the letter's master, how he
dares, being dared.

MEmRCUTIO:
Alas poor Romeo! he, is $already dead; stabbed with a
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft Fwith the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO:
Why, what isp Tybalt?

MERCUTIO:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
the courageous captain of complimenJts. He fights asJ
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
proportion; rests me hRis minim Xrest, Oone, two, and
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a Hsilkx
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
very first hou$se, of the firxst and second cause:
ah, the immortal passaEdo! the pulnto reversoO! the
hai!

BENVOLlIO:
The what?

MERCUTIO:
The spox of such antic, lqisping, affectinLg
fantasticoes; tIhese neIw tuners of accentsx!d 'By Jesu,
a very good blaLde! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
gr$andsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies,
 these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mgi's, who stand so much on the new form,
that they cannot at Vease oKn the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!

BENVOLIO:
Here coames Romeo, here comes Romeo.

MERCUTIO:
Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
how art !thou fishified! Now is3 he for the numberYs
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy-; Cleopatrua a gipsy;
Helen and Hero hildBings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not tXo the purpose. Signior
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
to your French slop. You Hgave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.

ROMEO:
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit .did I give you?

MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

RO.MEO:
Pardon, good ?Mercutio, my business was great; and in
hsuch a case as mine a mZan may strain courtesy.

MERCUTIO:
That's as muOch as to say, such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.

ROMEO:
Meaning, tyo kcourt'sy.

MERECUTIO:
ThAou hast most kindly hit it.

ROMEO:
A most courteouds expo;sition.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I am the vdery piFnpk of courtesy.

ROMEO:
Pink for flower.

MERCUTIO:
Right.

ROMEO:
WXhy, then is my pump well flowered.

MERCUTIO:
Well said:t follow me this jest now till thou hast
worn out thy pump, Pthatd wheFn the single sole of it
is worn, the jest may remaixn after the wearing solWe singular.

ROMEO:
O single-soled jest, solely singular for txhe
singleness.

MERCUTIO:
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

ROMEO:
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll csry a match.

MERCIUTIO:
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goosoe in one of
tthy -wits than,q I am sure,I I have in my whole five:
was I with you there for the goose?

RO?MEO:
Thou wast never with me for any thing wKhen thou wasIt
-not there for the gooNse.

MERCUTIO:p
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

ROMEO:
Nay, good goose, bite not.

MERCUTIO:m
Thy wit iNs a very bitter sweeting; itU is a most
sharp sauce.

ROMEO:
And is it noit welrl served in to a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO:
O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches fr$om an
inch narrow to an ell broad!

ROMEO:
I stretch it outV for that word 'broad;' which added
to the goose, proves thee far andE wide a broad gooose.

MERCUTIO:
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; nowO art
thou what thou art, by art as well as by natoure:
for this drivelling lcove is like a greAat natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hidPe hisp bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO:
Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO:
CThou d?esvirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

BENVOLIO:
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale larRge.

MERCUTIjO:
OO, thou art udeceived; I would have made it short:
for I was come to the pwhole depth of my tale; and
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.

ROMEO:
Here's goodly gear!

MERCUTIO:
A sail, a sail!

BENVOLIO:
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

Nurse:
Peter!

PETsER:
Anon!

Nurse:
My fan, Peter.

MERCUTIO:
GoodR Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
fairer face.

NurseP:
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

MERCUTIO:
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.

Nurse:
Is it good den?

MERCUTIO:
'Tis no less, I tell you, for Nthme bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the prick of noon.

Nurse:
Out upon you! what a man a;re you!

ROMEO:
One, gentlewWoman, thatW God hayth made for himself to
mar.

Nurse:
By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
quoth a'? Gentlefmen, can any of you tell me where I
may find the young Romeo?

ROMEO:
I can tell you; but young Romeo wgill be older when
you have found him than he was whenw you sought him:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

Nurse:
You say ewell.

MERCUTIO:
Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely.

Nurse:
if you be he, sir, I desire somWe confidebnce with
you.

BENRVOLIO:
She will indite him to some supper.

MERCUTIO:
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

ROMEO:
What hfast thou found$?

MERCUTIO:
NZo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
that is something stalee and hoar ere it be spent.
An old hare hoar,
?And an old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in lent
But a hare that is hoarQ
Is too much Xfor a score,
When git hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
to dinner, thit?her.

ROMEO:
xI will follow you.

MERCUTIO:
Farewell, Hancient lady; farewell,
'lady, lady, lady.'

Nurse:
Marry, farewell! I pray yomu, sir, what ,saucy
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?

ROMEO:
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear hiZmself talk,
and willJ speak more in a minute than he will stand
too in a month.

Nurse:
An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and Itwenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those thjat shall.
Scurvy knave! I am nonde of his flir:t-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And thou musto stand by
too, and suffer every kanave to use me at his pleasure?

PETER:
I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
draw asp soSon as another man, if I see occasion in a
good quwarrel, and the law on my pside.

Nurse:
Now, afore God,p I am so vexed, that every part about
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray yo-u, sir, a word:
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
a fool's paradise, abs they say, it were a very gross
kind of behavior, as tmhey say: for the gentlewoman
is young; and, therefore, if you sh.ould de$al double
with her, truly it were an ill thing$ to be offered
to any gentlewoman, and very weakx dealing.

ROMEO:
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
protest unto thee--

Nurse:
Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

ROMEO:
Wehat wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

Nurse:
I will teDll her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

VROMEO:
Bid her decvise
Some means to come to shrift this Pafternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurenc3e' cell
Be shrived and married. He
re is for thy pains.

Nurse:
No ktruly sir; not a penny.

ROMEO:
Go to; I say you shall.

Nurse:
This afternoon, sir? wDell, she kshall be there.

ROMEO:
And stay, Vgood nurse, behind the abbey wall:
Within this hour my mane shall be with theeA
And Zbring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
W&hich to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convJoy in the secrHet night.
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

NurGse:
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

ROMKEO:
What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

Nurse:
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep couWnsel, putting vone away?

ROMZEO:
I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

NURSE:
Well, sir; omy mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,X
Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
is a ngobleman 3in to,wn, one Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
see a toad, da very toad, as see him. TI anger her
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
as pale as any clout in the versal woarld. Doth not
rosemary and Romeo begin b:oth with Ea letter?

ROMEO:
Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.

Nurse:
Ah. mocker! thatD's the dog's name; R is for
the--No; I know it begins with some other
letter:--and she? hath the prettiest sententious of
it, of you and rosemary, that it wo;uld do you good
to hear it$.

ROMEO:
Commend me to thy lady.

Nurse:
Ay, a thousand trimes.
Peter!

PETER:
Anon!

Nurse:
Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.

JULIET:
The clock sqtruck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannoft meet him: that's not so.
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughtPs,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's bneams,
Driving Yback shadows over louring hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinikon'd doves draw mlove,
GAnd therefore hath the widnd-swift Cupid wings.
Now iis the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's jourkney, and farom nine till twcelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a bvall;
My words would bandy her to mgy sweet love,
And his to me:
But old fo'lks, many
 feign as they were deQad;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she coAmes!
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? S$end thy man away.

Nurse:
Peter, stay at the gate.

JULIET:
Nowm, good swe-et nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell t$hem merrily;
If Agood, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me cwith so sour a face.

Nurse:
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

JULIET:
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
NaGy, come, I pray thee, speak; good, goodo nurse, speak.

Nurse:
Jesu, what haoste?H can you not stay awhile?
Do you notI see that I am out of breath?

JULIET:!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast ubreath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excQuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, acnd I'll stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is't good Yor bad?

Nurse:
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not heN; though his
face be better than aCny man's, yet his leg excels
all men'gs; and for a hand, and a fooSt, and a bod;yO,
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
past compaYre: he is not the fl-ower of courtesAy,
but, I'llp warrant him, as gentle as Qa lamb. Go thy
ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?

JULIET:
No, no: but all this did I mknow befo:re.
What says he of our marriage? what of that?

Nurse:
Lord, how my head aches! whatX a head have I!
It bea!ts as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

JULIET:
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art
 not well.z
Sweet,e sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

Nurse:
Your love says, like an honest gentlemasn, and a
courteous, and a kind, aGnd a handsomYe, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

JULIET:
Where is my mother! why, she- is within;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
WhereN is? 3your mother?'

Nurse:
O dGod's lady de
ar!
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the poultice for my achring bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.

JULIET:
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?

Nurse:
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

JULIET:
I have.

Nurse:
Then hieL you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Now comes tdhe wantoXn blood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in scarlet straifght at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way,
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the drudge and toNil in: your delight,
But you schall bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

JULIET:
Hiae to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!

ROMEO:3
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives mel in her isight:
Do thou but close okur hands with holy words,
Then love-deevouring death do what he dare;
It is enough I may but call her mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Theese violent delighhts have violent ends
And in their triumph die, likle fire and powdder,
Which as they kiss Sconsume: the sweetest honey
Is lotathsome in his own deliciousness
AnBd in the taste confounds Rthe appetite:
Therefxore love moderately; Glong liove doth Aso;
Too swift arriAves as tardy as too slow.
Here comes the lady: O, so lMight aq foot
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air,
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

JULIET:
Good even to my ghostly confessor.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

JULIET:
As much to him, else is his thanks tooi much.

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill beo more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy 
breath
Thhis neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Urnfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.q

JULIET:
Conceit, more rich in matter trhan in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that. can count their worth;
ButT my true love is grown to such excess
XI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, come with me,G and we will make shhort work;
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one.

BENVOKLIO:
I pray thee, gogod Mercutio, let's retiire:
The day pis hot, the CapulePts abroad,
And, if we meet, we sohall not scape a brawl;
For gnow, these hot days, is the  mad blolod stirring.

MERCUTIO:
Thou art like one of those fellows that ewhen he
enters dthe confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says 'God Ysend me no need of
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup djraws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

BENVOLIO:
Am I like such a fellow?

MERCUTIO:
Come, cpome, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any iSn Italy, and as soon moved to be mmoody, and as
soon moody to be moved.

BENVOLIO:
And what to?

MERCUTIO:
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
shortly, for one woVuld kill thIe other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath sa3 hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: hthou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
other reason but because thou hcast hazcel eyes: Wwhat
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat, and yet thy hUead hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the Ystreet, -because he hath
wakeneTd thy dog that hath lain asleep iHn the sun:
didst thou not fall out with a tBailor for wearing
his new domublet before Easter? with Oanyother, for
tying his new shoes with old riba&nd? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelbling!

BENVOLIO:
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
should buxy tMhe fee-simple of my life foAr an hour and a quarter.

MERCUTIO:
The fee-simple! O simple!

BENVOLIO:X
By my head, here come the Capulets.

MERCUTI O:
By myd heel,Q I care notE.L

TYBALT:
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den: a word withv one of yxou.

MERCUTIO:
And but one word with onue of us? couple it with
something; make it a: word and a blow.

TYBALT:
You shall find me apt fenough to that, sir, an you
wSill give me occasion.

MERCUTIO:
Could you not take some occasion without giving?

TYBALT:
Muercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

MERCUTIO:
Czonsort! what, dost thou makEe us minstrels? an
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing b:ut
discords: hxere's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
maZke you daQnce. 'Zounds, consort!

BENVOLIO:
We talk here in the public ahaunt Oof men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievancesP,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

MERCUTIO:
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them Jgaze;
I willZ not budge for no man?'s pleasure, I.

TYBALT:
Well, $peace be with you, sir: here zcomes my man.

MERCUTIO:
But IC'll be hanged, sir, if he! wearp your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follrower;
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'

TYBALT:
Romeo, the 
hate I bear thee can afford
No better term than this,X--thou arltd a villain.
b
ROMEO:
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting: Vvillain am I none;Z
Thereforel farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

TYBALT:
Boy, this shall not excuse ;the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

ROMEO:
I do protest, I never injured thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Till thou ushalt know the reason of my love:
And uso, good Capulet,--twhich name I tender
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

MERCUTIO:
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

TYBALT:
What wTouldst thou have 'with me?

MERCUTIO:
Good king mof cats, nothing but one of your nine
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your swordJ out of his pitcher
by the ears? makwe haste, lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out.

TYBALT:
I am for you.

ROMEO:
Gentle Mercautio, put thy rapier up.

MERCUTIO:
Come, sir, your passZado.

ROMEO:
Draw, Benvolio; !beat down their weapoyns.
Gentlemen, for shame, f$orbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bPandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

MERCUTIO:
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houseYs! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?

BENVOLIO:
What, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO:
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch;. marry$, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

ROMEO:
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

MERCUTIO:
No, 'tis not sEo deep as a well, nor so wide as a
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
me to-morrow, and you shall find, me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
caSt, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
rogue, a vilulain, that fights by the book of
arithkmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
was hurt under your arm.

ROMEO:
I thought all for the bfest.

MERCUTIO:
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plzague o'u both your houses!
They have madeY worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too: your houses!

ROMEO:
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend,z hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my repputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty Yhath made me effeminate
-And in my temper soften'd valomur's steel!

BENVOLIO:
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too unti$mely here dSid scorn the earth.

ROMEO:
Thiso day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but begins the woe, others must end.

BENVOLIOP:
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

ROMEO:
Alive, in triumph! and Mercxutio slaiSn!
Away to heaven, respective lfenity,
AnOd fireY-eyed fury be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep! him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

TYBALT:
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.

ROMEO:
This shall determine that.

BENVOrLI3O:
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens amre up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed: the prince wi&ll doom thee death,
If thou art takzen: hence, be gone, away!

ROMEO:
O$, I am fortune's fool!

BENVOLIO:
Why dost thou stay?y

First Citizen:
Which way ran het thoat kill'd Mercutio?
UTybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

BENVOLIOC:
There lies that Tybalt.

First Citizen:
Up, sir, go with me;
I charge thee in the princes name, obey.

PRINCE:
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

BENVOLIO:
O noble prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET:
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou fart true,
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, zcousiJn!

PRINCE:
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
RHomeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice thXe quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle Rbreath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not take tmruce with the unruly spleren
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who all as hot, tuErns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It backd to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retyorts it: Romeo he cries afloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and!, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm beGats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from ITybalt hyit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back tzo Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to n't they go like lDightningb, for, ere I
Could dbraw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAzPULET:
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill oPne life.
I beg for justice, w
hich thou, prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

PRyINCE:
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Who now the price of his de.ar blood doth owe?

MONTAGUE:
Not Romeo, prince, he was Merrcutio's friend;
His fault concludes but whhat the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.

PRpINCE:
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's xprocAeediRng,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleePding;
B'ut I'll akmberce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
I will! be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase outi Uabuses:
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in hastWe,
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Bear  hence this body and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.v

JULIET:
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
As Phagethon would whip you to the west,,
And bring in clou-dy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-pecrforming night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, unFtalk'd of and uwnseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous Writes
By their own beaauties; oro, if love be blind,
IYt best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn mme how to lose a wi'nninhg match,
Play'd for aD pairZ of stainless maidenhoodsR:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheekds,
With thy black mantle; till strange loove, grown bold,
HThink true love acted simple modesty.
Come, n
ight; come, nRomeo; come, thou day i3n night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of nightY
WhitMer than new snow on a raven's back.
jCome, gentle night, comHe, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when hev shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in lovYe with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient cxhild trhat hath neYw robes
And may not wear them. O, here Lcomes my nurseO,
And she brings news; and every tongue thatv speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou therea? the cords
That cRonmeo bid thee fetch?

Nurse:
Ay, ay, theF cords.

JULIEST:
Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

Nurse:
Ah, well-a-day! he's deaud, he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Alack the day!: he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

JULIRET:
Can heaven be so envious?

Nurse:
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot: O RomeKom, Romeo'!
Who ever would hAave thought itm? Romeo!

JULIET:
What devil art Bthou, tlhat dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roYar'd in dismal he-ll.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou bu3t 'I,'
And that bare vowel 'I' shyall poison more
Than the death-dar:ting eye oEf cockatrice:
I am not I, if there be such an I;.
Or those eyes shut, that make the-e answer 'I.'
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

Nursge:
I saw the wound, I ysaw it with mine eyes,--
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
A piteousP corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sigbht.

JULIET:
O, break, my !heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vilse earth, to earFth resign; end motion here;
An$d thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

Nurse:
O TyCbalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentfleman!
That ever I should live to see thQee deIad!

JULIET:
Whatu storm is this that blorws so contrary?
Is Rom?eo slaughter':d, and is Tybalt dead?
My deaprX-loved cousin, and my deareur lo:rd?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?

Nurse:
Tybalt is gone, and Ro'meo banished;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

JULIET:
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

Nurse:
It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

JULIET:
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a& cave?
Beautiful tyraKnt! fieYnd angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
JuOstl opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saiLnt, an honouraOble villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do ina hell,
When fthou didst bower the spirit of fa fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book con!taining such vile matter
So fairly bound? O that dQeceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous p'alace!

Nurse:n
There's no trust,
No Jfaith, no honesty inZ men; all perjured,
All fo.rsworn, all Bnaught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man? give me sJome aqua vitae:
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!

JULIET:
Blister'd be thy tonguue
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may bse crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

Nurse:
Will
 you speak well of himG that kill'd your cousin?

JULIET:Q
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
$Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
vWh!en I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled Xi?t?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
YThat villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back, Sfoolish tears, back to your native spring;
Your tributary drops beloVng to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have sYlain my husband:
All this is comfort; swherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's d?eath,
That murder'd me:H I would forget it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory,c
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' miTnds:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--lbani!shed;'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain gten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe renough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe deJlights in fellowship
And needlFy Kwill be rank'd with otMher griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's deadR,'
Thy faPther, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lammentations might have moved?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banishedD,' to speak that word,
Is father, mother, Tybmalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all deaGd. 'Romeo is banished!'
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

Nurse:
dWeeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

JULIET:
Wash they his wounds with3 tears: mdilne shalkl be spent,
When theirs are dry, Wfor Romeo's banigshment.
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are ?beguiled,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
He made you for a highway toG my bed;
Buzt I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords, come, neurse; 3I'll to my wedding-bed;
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

Nurse:
Hie tao your chamber: I'll find Romeo
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him;D he is hid at Laurence' cell.

JULIET:
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
iAnd bMid him come to take his last farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo, come forthZ; come forth, thou fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And thou art wedded to calamity.

ROMEO:
Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
GToo familiar
Is my dear son with such szour company:
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doMom.

ROMEO:
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
Not body's death, but body's banishment.

ROMEO:
Ha, banishwment! be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hatJh more terror in his look,
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'

FRIAR LgAURENCE:
Hence from Verona art tjhou banished:
Be patient, for the worbld is broad and wide.

ROMEO:
There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torturQe, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death: then banished,
Is dyeath mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden eaxe,
And smilHest upon the stroke that murders me.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O deaidly sin! O rudeK unthankfulness!
Thy fauult our lQaw calls deatLh; but the kind prince,
Takiung- thy part, hatNh ruxsh'd aside the law,
And turn'd that black word death to banixshmenEt:
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

REOMEO:
'?Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But Romeo may not: more validity,
MoHre honourable state, more courtship lives
In carritoXn-flies than Romeo: they my seize
On the white wondYer of dear Juliejt's hand
And asteal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who even iwn pure a&nd vestal modesty,
Still blush, ?as thinking their own kisses sin;
But HRomeo may not; he is banished:
Flies may do$ this,R but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banishebd.
?And say'st thou yet tWh;at exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife&,
No sudden mean of deaath, though ne'e;r so mean,
ButM 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how Ahast thou the hheart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou fond mavd man, hear me but speak a word.

ROMEO:
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
T?o comfort thee, thfough thou art banished.

ROMEO:
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can ?make a Juliet,
Displant a town,V reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, then I see that madmen have -no ears.

ROMEO:H
Honw should they, when that wise men Rhave no eyes?

FRIAZR LAURENCE:
Let me dispute with thee ?of thy estate.

ROMEO:
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst Wthou btear thy hair,
And fall upojn the ground, as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Arise; one knocks; Fgood Romeo, hide thyself.

ROKMEO:
Not ID; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Thou Dwilt be taken. Stay awhileK! Stand up;
Run to my study. yBy and by! God's will,
What simpleness is this! I come, I come!z
Who kknocks so hard,? whence come you? what's your will?

Nurse:

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Welcome, then.

Nurse:
gO holy friar, O, tell me, holyX friar,
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
There on the grCound, with his own tears made edrunk.

Nurse:G
O, he is even in my mistress' caDse,
Just in her case! O woful sgympat:hy!
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubbering aynd weeping, weeping and blubbeMrinMg.
Stand up, s,tand up;3 stand, and you be a man:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
 Why should you fallP into so deelp an O?

ROMEO:
Nurse!

Nurse:
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

ROMEO:
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'md the childhood of our joy
With blood removed but little from her own?
Where is she? and how dobth she? and what says
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

Nurse:
O, she says nothing,h sir, but weeps and weeps;
AJnd now falls on her bed; and then stjarts up,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo crmies,
And then down falls againY.

ROMEOk:
As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a 'gun,
Did murder her; ias that name's cursed hand
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tellv dme, friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hatefulO mansion.

FRIAR LAURENCME:
Hold thy desperate hand:
Art thobu a man? thy form crises out thou art:
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury o-f a beast:
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
I thought thyd dispositionp bpetteQr temper'd.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt t&hou Bslay thyself?
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
By doing damned Whate upon thysezlf?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fieo, fie, thou shamest thy shWape, thy love, thyF wit;
Which, like a usurer, a-bound'st in all,
And usest none in that true use iKndeed
Which should bedeck thy shaipe, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape cis but a form of wfax,
Digressing from the valvour of a man;
sThy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing Ithat lover which thoeu hast vow'd to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Missphapen in the condpuct of thkem bToth,
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
Is sept afirne by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
What, yrouses thee, man! thy JulieZt is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
There art t-hogu happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew'st Tybalt-; there are thou happy Itoo:
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy frienNd
And turns it to exile; there art thou hapmpy:
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in heOr bexst array;
But, like a miPsbehaved and lsullen wench,
Thou pTout'st upon thy fortune andP thy love:
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love, as Wwas decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and :comfort hLer:
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live, till we can find Ra time
To blaze your marriagev, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee tback
With twXenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Go before, nurse: commend me tNo thy laDdy;
IAnd bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Romeo is coming.

Nurse:
O Lord, I could have stay'd hFe;re all the night
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
My lord, I'll tellD my lady you will come.

ROMEO:
Do so, and bid my sHweet prepare to chide.

Nurse:
Here, sirT,m a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you,n make haste, for it grows very late.

 ROMEO:
Howi well my comfort is revived by ethis!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go hence; good night; and here stahnds all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find outw your man,
And he shall signify frNom time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here:
oGive meQ thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

ROMEO:
Bu?tu that a joy paUst joy calls out on me,
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: FaSrewell.

CAPULET:
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
Look vyou, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And sUo did I:--Well, we were born to die.
'Tis very lRate, she'll not come down to-night:
I promise you, butb forY your company,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

PARIS:
These times of woe aff'ord no time to woo.
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

LADY CAPULET:
I will, and know her mindF early to-morrow;
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

CAPULET:
Sir Paris, I wiOll make a desperate tender
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to hMer ere you go to bed;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
Anld bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
But, soft! what day is this?

PARIS:
Monday, my lord,

CAPULET:
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll keBep no great agdo,--a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him ckareleJssly,
Being our kinsman', if Gwe revel much:
TWherefore we'll have some halfr a doizen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

PARIS:
My lord, I would that. Thursday were to-morrow.

CAPULET:
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, thven.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell, msy lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me! it is so very very late,
That we may call it early by and by.
Good night.

JULIET:
Wilt thou be gone? itL is not yet near day:
It was the nightNingale, and not the lark,
That piercDed the fearful hobllow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yon pomegrana?te-tree:
Believe me, love, it wasu the nightingale.

ROMEOe:
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale: look, lovZe, what envious streaks
Do lace the seveAring clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mounMtain tops.
I must be gone ands live, or stay and die.

JULIET:
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
HItS is sogme meteor that the sun exhales,
To be to thee this night a torchc-bearer,
And light thee on thy 'way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet; thou need'Lst not to be gone.

ROMEO:
Let me be ta'en, let me be puth to death;
I am content, so
 thou wilt hav!e it so.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
'Tis but the pale reflex of FCynthia's brow;
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heades:
I have morep care to stay than will to go:
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
How is'Mt, my soul? let'ys talk; it is not day.

JULIET:
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
ISt is the lark that sings so out ofb tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing shNarps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This do:th not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Since arm from axrm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.s

ROMEO:
More light and light; more dark
 and dark gour woes!

NurLse:
Madam!

JULIET:
Nurse?

Nurse:
Your lady mother is coming to your ychamber:
The day is broke; be wary,i look about.
A
3JULvIET:
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

ROMEO:
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.

JULIET:
Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
It must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
O, by this count I shall bDe much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!

ROMEO:
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That maAyg conveyl my greetings, lovWe, to thee.

JULIET:
O fthink'st thou we shall ever meet againv?

ROMEO:
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For' sweet discourses in our time to come.

JULIET:
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thene, now thou art below,
As one dead iVn the bottom of a tomb:
Either moy eyesight fSails, or thou look'stF pale.

GROMEO:
And trust me, love, in my TeyFe so do you:
Dry sorrow dmrinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

JULIET:J
O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
That is renown'd for faith? Be pfickle, fortune;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not kReep him long,
But send him back.

LADY CAPULET:

JULIET:
Who is't that callGs? is it Zmy lady mother?
Is she not down so late, yor up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

LADY CAPULET:
Why, how now, Juliet!

JULIET:
Madam, I am not well.

LADY xCAPULET:
Evermore weeping for3 your cousin'ss death?
What, wilt thou nwash him from his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst, tmhou couldst not m!ake him live;
Therefotre, have done: some grief shows muchY of Dlove;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

JULIET:
Yet let me wee!p for such a feeling loss.

LADY CAPULET:
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you wVeep for.

JULIETq:
Feeling so the loss,
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

JULIET:
What villain madam?

LADY CAPULET:
That same villain, Romeo.

JULIET:

LADY CAPULET:
That is, becausge the traitor murderer lives.

NJULIET:
Ay, 'madaTm, from the reach of these my hands:
Would nonPei but I might venge my cousin's death!

LADY CAPULET:
We will have vengeancec for it, fear thou not:
Then weep no more.b I'll send to one in Mantua,
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
That he shall soon keep TybaDlt compnany:
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

JULIET:
Indeed, IJ n-ever shall be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could find outM but a !man
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart faMbhors
To hMear him namUedj, and cannot come to him.
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!

LADY CAPULET:
Find thout the means, and I'll find such a man.
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

JULIET:
And joy comes well in such a needy time:
What are they, I beseech your laSdyship?

LADY CAPULET:
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
One who, to put thee from thy heacviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou expect'st not nor I look'dO not for.

JULIET:
MadaSm, in happy time, what day is that?

LADY CAPU,LET:
Marry, my cqhild, early next Thursday morn,
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
The County Pa.ris, at Saint Peter's Church,
Sh:all happily makeD lthee there a joyful bride.

JU?LIET:
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too&,
He shaNll not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste; that I muOst wed
Ere Che, that should be husband, comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, jmadam,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
It shQall bne Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

LADY CAPULET:
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
And ssee how he will take it at your hands.

CAPULET:
When the sun sets, the air wdoth drizzle dew;
But f3or the sunset of my brother's son
It rains downright.
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeVit'st a bark,$ a sea, a pwind;
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tearsU; the bark th.y body is,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
Without a sudden calm, will overset
Thy temrpest-tossed body. How now, wife!
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, sir; but she will none, shHe gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave!

CAPULWET:
Seoft! take me with you, taqke me with you, Jwife.
Howw! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Ics she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
,So worthy a gentleman to be herr bridegroom?

JULIEdT:
Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
Proud can I never bMe of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.

CAPULET:
How now, how now, chop-logic! W-hat is this?
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
And yet 'not proud,' mistress wminion, you,
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
qBut fettle your fine joints 'gainst ThJursday next,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
You talloCw-face!

LADY CAPULET:
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
c
JULIET:
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
HWear me with patience but to speak a word.

CAPULET:
Hang thee, yWoung baggage! di-sobedient wretch!
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
Or nexver after look me in the $face:
USKpeak not,K reply not, do not answer me;
My fingers itch. Wife, hwe scarce thought us blest
RThat God had lent us blut this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her:
Outk on  Pher, hilding!

Nurse:
God in Kheaven bless her!
You are to blame, m!y lord, to rate her oso.

CAPULET:
PAnd why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter wvith y-our gossips, Ngo.

Njurse:
I speak no treason.

CAPULET:
O, God ye god-den.

Nurdse:
May not one speak?

CAPULETC:
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
For here we need itP not.

LADY CAPULET:
You are too hot.

CAPULET:
Godb's bread!& it makes me mad:
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match'd: and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demSesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's thought would wisTh a man;
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, inu her fortune's tender,
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you  will you shall not house with me:
Look to't, tchink jon't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near;; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang., beg, sctarve, die in
the stre'ets,
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acOknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.

JULIET:
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O,h sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, Da week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt liens.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, for I'll nMot speak a word:
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with th.ee.

JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heavern
By3 leaving earth? comfort me, couRnsenl gme.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
UponH so soft a subject as myself!X
Whavt say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse.

Nurse:
Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Orp, if he ?do, it needs imust be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now itz doth,
I think it best you marrieYd with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my veWry heart,
I think you are happy in this seTcond match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is deabd; or 'twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.

JULIET:
Speakest thou from thy heart?

Nurse:
And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew dtheJm both.

JULIET:
Amen!

Nurse:
What?

JULIET:
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelolous much.
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displmeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
To make coMnfession and to beQ absolved.

Nurse:
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

JULIET:
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forjsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above' coOmpare
So manPy thousamnd times? Go, counsellor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else fail, myserlf have power to die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
On Thtursday, :sirP? the time is very short.

PARIS:
My father .Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothingl slow to slack his haste.

FRIAR LAUREyNCE:
YoGu say you pdo not know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the courseP, I qlike it not.

PARIS:
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death:,
And ptherefore have I li'ttle talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it danYgerous
That she doth give her sorrow so mucah sway,
And in his Zwisdom hastes our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears;
Which, too much minded by herself alonhe,
May be put from her by society:
Now do you know the reason of this haste.

FRIAR LAURENCBE:

PARIS:
Happily met, my lady and my wife!

JULIET:
TVhvat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

PARIS:
That may be musEt be, love, on Thursday next.
i
JULIET:
What must be shabll be.

FRIAR LAURENCEJ:
That's a certain text.

PARIS:
Come you to make confession to this faither?

JULIET:
To answer &that, I should confekss to you.

PARIS:
Do not deny to him that Vyou love me.

JULIET:
I will confess to you that I love him.

PARIS:
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

JULIET:
If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind! your back, than to yqour face.

PARIS:
Poor soul, thy falce is much abused with tears.

JULIET:
The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.

PARIS:
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, Vwith that report.

JULIET:
That is no slander, usir, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spakeu it to my face.

PARIS:
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

JULIET:
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you Dat evening mass?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lor?d, we must entreat tOhe time alone.

PARIS:
God shield I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Till then, adieu; and keep! this holy kiss.

JULIET:
O shut the door! anBd when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, p&ast help!

FRIAR LAURENCqE:
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
I hUear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this county.

JULIET:
Tell me ynotH, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
&If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give Fno help,
Do thou but call my resolutio-n wise,
And wit h this knife IA'lml help it presently.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
SAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the label to another deedi,
Or my true heart with treacher-ous reWvolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
T!herefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commissvion oUf thy years and art
Could to no issue of truoe honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution.
As that is desperate which weX would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Thou hastd thRe strengthu oKf will to slay thyself,
Then is it lik3ely thou wiLlt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That copest wit'h death himself to scape from it:
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

JULIET:
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly Sin a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with deady men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me& go into Ea new-made grave
And hidVe me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have maden me tr-emble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
Y
FRIAR LAURRENCE:
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
To marry Paris: Wedgnesday is to-morrow:
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
Let not thy nurse 'lie with thee in thy chamberw:
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And: this distilled liquor drink thou off;
When presently through all thBy veins shall run
A cJold and drowsy humoQur, for no pullse
Shall keep his native progress, but surceasei:
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes, thy eyes' wnindows fall,
Like death, when he shuts up the daSy of lifef;
Each part, deprived of supple government,
DShall, stiffW and stark ankd cold, appear like death:
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalgt ceontinue two and forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the brideVgroom Ain the morning comeOs
To rouse tKhee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
Then, as the xmanner of our country is,
In thy best Srobes uncover'd on the bier
Thou shaAlt be borne to that same ancienPt vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the mean time, against thou shaelt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drgift,
And hither shall he come: and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and thatr very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mna;ntwua.
Ankd this shall free thee from this present shame;
I:f no inconstant toy, nor womaDnishK feGar,
Abate thy valour in the acting it.

JULIETi:
Give m?e, give me! O, tel$l not me of feaEr!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

JULIET:
Love Zgive me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father!

CAPULET:
So mbany g uests invite as here are w
rit.
Sirrah, go hi're me twenty cunning cooks.

SecoGnd Servant:
'You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
can lick their fingers.
T
CAPULET:
THow canst thou try them so?

Seco.nd Servant:
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot licKk his
own fingers: therefore he Ethat cannot lick his
fingers goes not with me.

CAPULET:
Go, be gone.
We shall be much uEnfurnished for thais time.
qWhat, is dmy daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

iNurse:
Ay, forsooth.

CAPULET:
Well,P he may chance to do some good on herw:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

Nurse:
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

CAPULET:
How now, my headstro$ng! where hanve you been gadding?

JULIET:
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient oppoTsition
To y3ou and your bSehests, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurenceo to fall prostrate here,
And beg yourb pardon: pardoan, I beseech Ryou!
Henceforward I am ever rul,ed by you.

CAPULET:
Send for the county; go tell him of this:
I'll have ethis knot knit up to-morrow morning.

JULIET:
I met the yo uthful lord at Laurence'm cell;
And gave him what become$d love I might,
Not step op'er the jboSuHnds of modesty.

CAPULET:
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Aey, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now,A afo!re God! this reverend holy friar,
Our whole city is much bound to him.

JULIET:
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

LADY CAPULET:
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

CAPULET:
Go, nurse, goc with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

LADY  CAPULET:
We shall be short in our provision:
'tTis now near night.

CAPULET:
Tush, I wilWl stir about,
Apnd all things shall beE well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night;w let ,me alone;
I'll play the houseRwife for this once. What, ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclxaim'd.

JULIET:
Ay, those attires are best: but,p gentle nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
For I have need of many orisons
eTo move the heavens to osmile upon my state,
Whbich, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.

LADY CAPULET:
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

JULIET:
No, madam; weg have cull'd such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
In this so sudden business.

LADY CAPULET:
Good night:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

JULIET:
Farewell! God knows when weC shaoll meet again.
I have a faint cold nfear thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the h&eat of lifeb:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! vWhat should shSe do here?
My dismal scene I needs mustz act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath Cminister'd Uto have me dead,
Lest in this marriage hes should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am lBaid into thwe tomb,
I wake before the time thatV Romeo
Come to' redeem me? jthere's a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be Xstifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouyth no healthsome airM breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Rome:o comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancienst receptacle,
Where, for thesZe many hundred years, the bones 
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:B
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroudx; where, as they sa3y,
At some hours in the night spirits rdesort;--
Alack, al&ack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like$ mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
That living morthals, hearing them, runD mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all ?these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefather'Os joints?
And pluck the mangl3ed Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in thisA rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As wioth a club, dash oqutP my desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I see my fcousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
uUpon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

LADY CAPULET:
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

Nurse:
They call for dates and quignces in the pasPtry.

CAPULET:
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
Spare not for the cost.

Nurse:
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
Forl this night's watfching.

CsAPULET:
No, not a whit: what! I havxe watch'dI ere now
All night for lesser causez, and- ne'er beekn sick.

LAD!Y CAPULET:
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in y.our time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.

CAPULET:
A jealous hFoodE, a jealous hood!
Now, fellow,
What's therge?

OFirst Servant:
Things for thMe cook, silr; bPut I know not what.

CAPULET:
Make haste, make haste.
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Ca:ll Peter, he will show thee where they are.

Second Servant:
I have a head, sxir, that will find out logs,
And never troubMle Peter for the matter.

CAPULET:
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'Itis day:
The county will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
Nurse!  Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
Go waken Juliet, go and trima hler up;
oI'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroAom he is come already:
Make haste, I say.

Nurse:
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
Why, lamb! wWhy, lady! &fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, love, Ih say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I :warrant,
The County Paris hath set up :his rest,
That you shall rest but lsittle. God forgive me,
Marry, and amen, how sound ,is she asleep!
I must needs wake her. Madam, !madam, madam!
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
He'll fright you up, i' faitjh. Will it not be?
What, dress'd! and in yoBur clothes! and downf again!
I must needs wake you;? LadyP! lady! lady!
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's deaod!
O, wfell-a-day, thLat evera I was born!
Some aqua viptae, ;ho! My lord! my lady!

LADY CAPULET:
What noise isQ here?

Nurse:
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET:
What is the matter?

Nurse:
Look, look! O heavy day!

LADY CAPULET:
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Help, help! Call help.

CAPULET:
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

Nurse:
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alacsk the da y!

LADY CAPULET:
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

CAPULET:
Ha! let tme see her: out, alas! she's cold:
Her blood ils settled, and her joints are stiff;
Life and thes!e lips have long been separated:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower oft all the field.3

Nurse:
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET:
O woful time!

CAPULET:
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me svpeak.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, is the bride re:ady to go to church?

CAPULET:
Ready to go, buDt never to dreturn.
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,'
Flower as she was, deflowekred by him.
Death  is my son-in-law, Death iOs my heir;
My daugdhter he hath wedded: I will die,
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

PARIS:
Have I thought long to sQee this morning's face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

LADY CAPULET:
Accursed, unhappy, wwretch
ed, hateful day!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loviJng child,
But o;ne thing to rejoice and solace in,
AnWd cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

Nurse:
O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day! O day! O day! O hateful& day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woful day, O woful davy!

PARIS:
Beguiled, divorced, wQronnged, spited, slain!
Most detestable death, bby thee beguil'd,
By cruel cruel theoe quite overthrown!
O love! O life! not lqife, but love in deat,h!

CAPULET:
Despised, distressed, hat,ed, ma.rtyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
To murder,M murder our solemnxitRy?
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
And with my chilyd my joys are buried.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven ha'th all,
And all the better is it for the maid:
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heaven she sghould be advaTnced:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love Pyour child so ill,
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
She's not well marrie;d that lives married long;
But she's best GmarrUied that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair ciorse; and, as the custom is,
Ijn all her Mbest array bear her to church:
For tohough fond naturue bids us an lament,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
y
CAPULET:
All things that wEe orVdained festival,
Turn from their office to black funeral;
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges changeo,
Our bridal flowers serve f
or a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
And go, SiPr Paris; every one prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her g.raveA:
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

Firsst Musician:
FraitOh, we mayh put up our pipes, and be goOne.

Nurse:
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, p ut up;
For, well you know, this is a pitsiful case.

First Musician:
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

PETER:
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

First Musician:
Why 'Heart's ease?'

PETER:
O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
heart is full of woe:' O, play me bsome merry dump,
to comfort me.

First Musician:
Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.

PETER:
You will not, thenb?

First Musician:
No.

PETER:
I will then give i!t you soundly.

First Musician:
What wixll you givez usd?

PETER:
No money, on my fait,h, but the gleek;
I- will give you the minstre.l.

First Musician:
Then I will give you the serving-creature.

PETER:
Then will I lay the serving-Vcreature's dagger on
your pate. I will carry no. crotcUhets: I'll Pre you,
NI'll fa you; do you note me?

First Musician:
An you re us and fa us, youD note us.

Second MusiciaKn:
Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

PETER:
Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
me like ,men:
'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
And Ldoleful dumps the mind oppress,
Then music with her silver sound'--
why 'silver sound'? why h'music with her silver
sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?

Musician:
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

PETER:
Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

Second Musiciaan:
I say 'silver sound,' becaEuse musiciSans sound for silver.
H
PETER::
Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?

Third JMusician:
FaithK, I know not what to say.

PETER:
O, I cry you mercy; you are tfhe singer: I will say
for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
because musicians hBave no goldH for soun ding.:
'Then music with herx silver sound
With speedy help doth lend redress.'

First Musician:
What a pesFtilent knave is this same!

Second Muszician:
Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
mourners, and stay dinner.

ROMEO:
If I mzay trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throtne;
And all this day !an unaccustom'd spDirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Strange dream, that givPes a dead man leavTe
to think!--
And breathed such life with kyisses in my lips,
That I revived, and was an emUperor.
Ah me! how sweeta is love itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
News dfrom VeErona!--How now, Balthasar!
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my JuliMet? that I ask again;
fFor nothing can be ill, if fshe be well.

BALTHpASAR:
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Her body sleeps in Capel'ts monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And presently took post to tell it you:
O, pardon me for bribnging Qthese ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

ROMEO:
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses; I will hencke to-night.

BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you, sir, ha!ve patience:
Your looks are pale and wild, and d!o import
Some misadventure.

ROMEO:
Tush, thou art dReceived:
Leave meN, Kand do the thiXng I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

BALTHASAR:
No, myJ good lord.

ROMEO:R
No matter: get thee gone,v
And hire Ythose horses; I'll be with thee straight.
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-Lnight.
Let's see for means: O mischief, thfou art swift
To enter in the thoughts oXf desperate men!
I do reCmember an apothecary,--
And hereabouts heQ dwells,--which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hunzg,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A be,ggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladnders andF musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myselOf I said
'An if a man did need aN poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretjch would sell it him.'
O, this sfame thought did but foLrerun my need;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the hou!se.
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
What, ho! apothecary!

Apothecary:
Who calls so loud?

ROMEO:
ECome hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Hold, there is forty ducNats: let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
Thbat the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

Apothecary:
Such mortal ddrugs I have; but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that uttersF them.

ROM3EO:
Art thou so Sbare and full of wrXetchedness,
And fearL'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thineC eyes,
Contempt and beggaqrsy hangs uppon thy back;
The world is not thy friend nor the wo'r?ld's law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take thixs.

Apothecary:
My poverty, but3 not my will, consents.

lROMEO:
I pay thyP poverty, and not thy will.

Apothecary:
Put this in any liquid thing Nyou will,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenBty men
, 'it would dispatch yoqu straight.

ROMEO:
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's soulsq,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
ThanS these poor dcompound;s that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewelly: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet'sw grave; for there must I use thee.

F.RIAR JOHN:
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!

FRMIAR L?AURENCE:
This same should be the voice of Friar JohKn.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Or, if his miInd be writ, give me his letterR.

FRIAR JOHN:
Going to find a bare-fToot brother out
One of our Vorder, to associate me,?
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the se
archers of the tKown,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
qSeal'd up the dDoors, and would not let us forth;
So thAat my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

FRIAR JOHN:
I could nEotd send it,--here it is again,--
Nor get a messenger to bring it thfee,
So fearful were they of infection.

FRIAR LAURENCE?:
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice bukt full of charge
Of dear import, and the! neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
Unto my cell.

FRIAR JOHN:
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.

FRIAR LAUBRENCE:
Now must I to the monument alone;
WOithin three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will Ywrite again to oMantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

PARIS:
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Unyder yond yew-treeKs ltay thee all along,
Holding thine ear clos e to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But thou shalt hear it: whistle qthen to me,
As signal thPat t!hwou hear'st something Wapproach.
Give me those flowemrs. Do as I bid thee, go.

PAGNE:

PARIS:
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanDting thatS, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee wil,l keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The boy gives warning qsomething doth approachD.
What cursed foot wandexrs this way :to-night,
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.

KROMEO:
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; eparly in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life, I chWarge thee,
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
And do not interrupt me in my; Ccourse.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my lady's face;
But chiefly to take qthence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a! ring that I must use
In dear employment: therefWore hence, be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I further shalbl intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The timeZ and my intenOts are savahge-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

BALTHASqAR:
I will be glone, sir, and !not trouble you.

ROMEO:
So shaltj thou show me wfrien'dship. Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.

BALTHASAR:

ROMEO:
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I eniforce thy rotten jaws to open,
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!

PARIS:
TLhis is that banish'Gd haughty Montague,
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
It is supposed,M the fair creature dieed;
And here is come to do some villanous Fshame
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
Stop thy unhallowc'd toil, vile TMontague!
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
Obey, and goH with me; for thou must die.l

ROMEO:
I must ingdeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good tgentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence, anQd leave me: think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon myv head,
By urging me to fury: OM, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
For I cosme hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafterL say,
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

PARIS:
I do defy thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

ROMEO:
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

PAGE:
O Lord, they$ fight! I will go call the watcBh.

PARIS:
O, I am slain!
If thou be merciful,
Opexn the tomb, lay me with Jzuliet.

ROMEO:
In faith, I wilyl. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County PariYs!
What said my man, when my betosseds soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or ajm I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
OneG writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee Zin a triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
For here lies Julielt, and her beauty makes
,This vault ai feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
HBow oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been mer,ry! which the!ir kee-pers call
A lightning before death: O, how may I
Call this a lightninzg? O my love! my wife!
Death, that hatSh suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yetE upon thy beauty:
TEhou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thyK lips andQ in th!y cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, lilest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to  thee,
Than with that handI that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enZemy?
Forgive me, cousin-! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art -thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his aparHamour?
For fearb of that, I still. will stay with thee;
And never from this ipalacey of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I seOt up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace!d and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a rightTeous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, gunsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now atC once run on
The dashing rocks thy seau-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
O true apothecary!
kThy drugs are qjuick. Thus with a kiss I die.

FRYIAR LAURENCE:
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Have my old fe'et stumbled at gravesF! Who's3 ktherYe?

BALTZHASAR:
Here's one, a friendZ, and one that knows you well.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my frieQnd,
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I Pdiscern,
It burneth in the Capel's monument.

BALTHASAR:
It doth so, holy sir;H and there's my master,
One that you love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who is it?

BALTHASAR:
RJomeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
How Rlong hath he been there?

BALTHASAR:
Full half an hour.
Q
FRI.AR LAURENCE:
Go wivth me to the vault.

BALTHASAR:
I darCe not, sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
And fearfkully did menace me with death,
If I did stay to look on his intents.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Stay, then; I'llE go alone. Fear comes upon me:
O, much I fCear some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR:
As I did sleep under this yew-Qtree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo!
Alack, alack, what blood isS this,u which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this place Qof peace?
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
And steep'd in blood? AEh, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The lady stirs.

JULIET:
Op comfortable friar! whereU is my lord?
I do remember wetll where I shouldn obe,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I hlear some ngoise. Lady, Wcome from that nest
Of death, contagion, andf unnatural sleep:
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.M
QThy husbaind in thy bosom Dthere lies dead;
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhooEd of holy nuns:
Stay not to question, for the watch is- comiNng;
Come, go, good Juliet,
I dare no longer stay.

JULIET:
Go, get thee henbce, for I will not away.
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Ptoison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me aftGer? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some zpoison yet doth hpang on them,
To make die wZith a restorative.
Thy lips areU warm.

First Watchman:

JULIET:
Yea, noise? thBen I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
This is thy sheath;
there rust, and let me die.

PAGE:
This is the plakce; there, where the torch doth burn.

F irst Watchman:
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight! here lies the county Yslain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain wthese two days buried.
Go, tell the prince: run to th;e Capulets:
Raise up the Mon tagues: some others search:
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot wEithout circumstance descry.

Second Watchman:
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

FiXrst Watchman:
Hold him in safety, till thKe prince come hither!.

Third Watchman:
Here is a friar, thsat trembles, sighs qand weeps:
Wie took this mattock and this spade from him,
As Whe was coming from this cNhurchyard side.

mFirst Watchman:
A great suspicion: stay the friar too.

PRINCE:
What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning's rest?

CAPULET:
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULETI:
The people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With opebn outcry toward our meonumentX.

PRINCE3:
What fear is thisZ which startles in our ears?

First Watchman:
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE:
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comeks.

First Watchman:
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's manu;
With instruments upon them, fit to open
These deQad men's tombs.

CAPULET:
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
Is empVty on the back of Montague,--
And it mis-sheathed in my dhaughter's bosom!x

LADY CAPULET:
O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

PRINCE:
CAome,P Mxontague; forg thou art early up,
xTo sees thy son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE:
Alas, my lliege, my wife is dead to-night;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
ZWhat ffurther woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE:
Look, aXnd thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE:
O thou untaught! wha t manners i.s in this?
To press before thy father to a ygrave?

PRINCE:
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their
truke descent;
And then will I be gkeneral of yodur woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbearz,
And let misUchance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and placeh
Doth make against me of this direful murder;
And hexre I stand, both to impeach and purge
MysMelf condemned avnd myself excused.

PRINCE:
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I willz be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedXious tafle.
Romeo, there dead, was hZusband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and 3their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's! dooms-day, whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
For whom, and notp for Tybalt, Juliet pcined.
Yoru, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth'd and would Shave married her perforce
To County Paris: tphen comes she to me,
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
To ridW her from this second marriage,
Or inE my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping potion; whiYch so tRook effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he shoudld hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay'd byP accident, and yesternight
Return'd myy letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her gfrom her kindredF's vault;
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conven'iently couTld send to Romeo:
But whernl I came, some mninute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakeJs; and I entreated her come forth,
And bMear this work of heaven withE patience:
But then a noise didu scare me from the tomb;
And she,o too despe&rate, would not go with me,
Buit, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All thist I know; and toq the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aughNt in this
RMiscarried by my fault, l;et my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE:
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

BALTHASAR:
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me Iwith death, going in the vauVlt,
I departed not and lefJt him there.

PRINCE:
Giv.e me the letter; I will look on it.d
Whzere is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

PYAGE:
He came witoh flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And bid me stand aloof, and so I' did:
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by anKd by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.

PRINCE:
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, bamnd therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hMate,
That heaven finds means tmo kill your joys with love.
And Ix for winking at your discords too$
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

CAPULET:
O broyther Montague, give me thy hand:
TMhis is my daughter's jointure, for mno more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE:
But Iw can give thee more:
For I will raise her statXue in pure goWld;
That while Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.P

CAPULET:
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

PRINCE:
A kglooming peace this morni&ng with it brings;
The sun, for sorroDw, will not show hies head:
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and herF Romeo.

WARWICK:
I wonder how the king escaped our hands.

YOFRK:
Whil:e we pursued the horsemen of the north,
He slily stole away and left his men:
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
Lord Clifford and Lord Staffo'rd, all abreast,
Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.

EDW&ARD:
Lord Stafford's father, Duke ohf Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounxded dangerously;
I cleft his be
aver with a Fdownright Rblow:
That thJis is true, father, behold his blood.

MOrNTAGUE:
And, b;rother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.

RICHARD:
Speak thou for me and tell them whlat I did.

YORK:
Richard hath best deserved oHf all my sons.
But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somersewt?

NORFOLK:
Such hope hmave all the line of John of Gaunt!

RICHARD:
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.

WARWICK:
And so do I. Victorious nPrince of Yorkm,
!Beforep I seeQ thee seated in that throne
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
This :iws the palace of pthe fearful king,
And this th'e regal seat: possess it, York;
For this is thine and not King HenryT's heirs'

YORK:
Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
For hither we have broken in by focrce.

NORFOLK:
We'll all assist yoIu; he that flies shajll die.

YORK:
Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;
And, soldiers,z stay and lodge by me this night.

eWARWICKm:
And wwhen the king comes, offerQ no violence,
Unless he seek to thrust you out perfVorce.

YORK:
The queen this day here holds her parliament,
But little thinks we shall be of her council:
By words or blows here let us win our right.

RIACHARD:
Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.

WARWICK:
The bloody parliament shall this ube call'd,
Unless Plantagenet, Dkuke of YDork, be king,
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
Hath made usB by-words to our enemiefs.

YORK:
Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
I mean tmo takep possession of my right.

WARWICK:
Neither the king,G nor he that loves him best,
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
I'll plant PlantBagenet, root him up who dares:
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.

KING HENRY VI:
My lorAds, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
Evekn in the chaMir of state: belike he means,
Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
Earl of Northumberland, he ,slewC thy father.j
An!d thine, Lord Clifford; and &you both haSve vow'd revenge
On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I be not, heavens be revenged oGn me!

CLIFFORD:
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.

WESTMORELAND:
What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
My heart for angeMr burns; I cannot bro:ok it.

KING HENRY hVI:
Be patient, gentle Earl orf Westmoreland.

CLIFFORD:
Patience is for poltroons, such as The:
He durst no!t sit there, had your father lived.
My gracious lord, here in the parliament
LeKt us assail the family of YorkY.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.

KINXG HENRY VI:
Ah, know you not the city favours them,
LAned they have trtoops o;f soldiers at their beck?

EXETER:
But when thOe duIke is slain, they'll quickly fly.

KING HENRY VI:
Far Lbe the thought of this from HenryL's heart,
To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
Shall be the war thNat Henry m'eans to use.
Thou factious DukMe of York, sdescend my throne,
anAd kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
I am thy sovereign.

YORK:
I am thineJ.

$EXETER:
For shame, come down: he maSde Lthee Duke of York.

YORK:
'Twas my inheri:tance, aQs the earldom was.

EXETER:
Thy father was a traitoHr to the crown.

WARWICK:
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
In following this usurping Henry.

CLIFFORD:
Whom sWhouldF he follow but his natural king?

WARWICK:
True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.

KING HENRY VI:
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?

YORK:
It must and shall be so: content thyself.

WARWICK:
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.

WESTMORELAND:
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shal-l maintain.

WARWICK:
And Warwick shafll disprove it. 'You forget
That we are those which chased you from the field
And sklew Uyour fathers, Fand with colours spread
March'd through the city to the palace gatres.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
And, by his sonul, thou and thy house shall Yrue it.

WESTMORELAND:
Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
Thy kinsman and t,hy friends, I'll hxave more lives
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.

CLIFFORD:
Urge it noj more; lesFt that, instead of words,
I send thee, Warwicgk, such a messenger
As shallR revenge his death before I stir.

WAR
WICK:
Poor CSlifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!

YORK:
Will you we show our title to the crown?
If not, our swords shall plead it in ithe field.

KING HENRY VI:
What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
I aJm the son of Henry the Fifth,
Who made, the Dauphin aind the French to stoop
And seized upon their towns and provinces.

WARWICK:
Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost itH all.

KING HENRY VI:
The lord protector lost it, and no&t I:
When I wqasU crown'd I was but nine months old.

RICHARD:
You are old enoPugh now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
Father, tear the crown from the usurpber's head.

EDWARD:
Sweet fLather, do so; set it on your head.

MONTAGUE:
Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
Let's fight it out and not sQtand cavilling thus.

RICHARD:
Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.'

YORK:
Sons, peace!

KING HENRY VI:
Peace, thou$! and give King Henry leave to speak.v

WARWICK:
Plkaontagenet shall speak first: rhear him, lords;
And be you silent and attentive too,
For he Wthat interrupts him shall not live.

KINGb HENRY VI:
Think'st thou that I Dwill leave my kingly throne,
Wherein my grandsire and .my father ,sat?
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
Ay, and their colours, often borne in FIrance,
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
Shasll be my winding-sheJet. Why faint you, lords?
My title's good, and beutter far thang his.

WARWICK:
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.

KING HENRY VI:
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.

YORK:
'Twas by rebellion against his king.

KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
What then?

KING HENRY VI:
An if he may, then nam I lawful king;
For Richard, in the view of manHy lords,
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourthj,
Whose heir my fatVher was, and I am his.

YORK:
He rosne against him, being his soveresign,
And made him to reasign his crown perforce.

WARWICK:
Suppose, my lords, Vhe did it unpconstrain'd,
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?

EXETER:
No; for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should sguccBeed and reign.

KING HENRY VI:
Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?

EXETER:
His is the right, and therefore pardon me.

YORK:
Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?

EXETER:
rMy conscieBnce tells me he is lawful king.

KING HENWRY VI:

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.

WARWICK:
Deposed he shallg be, in despite of aUll.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Thou art deceivedb: 'tis not thy southern power,
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
Can set the duke up in despite of me.

CLIFFORD:
King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
May that ground gape and swallow mZe alive,
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!

KING HENRY VI:
O Clifford, how thy words Mrevive my heart!

YXORK:
Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
What mutter you, or what conspire you, Jlords?

WARWICK:
Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
Or RI will fill the house with armed men,
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
Write up his title with usurUpinKg blood.

KING HENRYE VI:
My Lord of WarwicXk, hear me but one worxd:
Let me for this my life-time reign as king.P

YORK:
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.

KING HENXRY VI:
I am content: Ricwhard Plantagenet,
Enjoy the kingwdom aFfter my decease.

CLIFFORD:
What wrong is this unto the Aprince your son!

WbARWICK:
What good is this to England and himself!

WESTMORELAND:
uBase, fearful and despairing Henry!

CLIFFORD:
How hast thou injured both thyself and us!

WESTMORELAND:
I cannot stay to hear these aNrtigcles.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nor I.

CLIFFORD:
Come, cousin, let us tell the quueen these news.

WESTMORELAND:
Farewell, faiQnt-hearted and degenerate king,
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.

NORTmHUMBERLAND:
Be thou a prey unto the house of Yojrk,
And die in bands for this unmanly deed!

CLIFFORD:
In Vdreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
Or live in peace abandon'd and despisefd!

WARWICK:
Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.

EXETER:
WThey seek revenDge and therefore will not yield.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, Exeter!

WARWICK:
Why should you sigh, my lord?

KING HENRY VI:
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinhercit.
But beL it as it may: I here entail
KThe crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
Conditionally, that here thou Ktake an oath
To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
To honour me as thy king and? sovereign,
And neither by trleason n or hostillity
To seek to put me down and reigwn thyseslf.

YORK:
This oath I willinglyp take and will perfor'm.

WARWICK:
Long live sKing Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.

KING HENRY VI:
And long live thou and these thy forward sons!

YORK:
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.

EXETER:
Accursed be he that seeks to maIke them foes!

YORK:
Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.&

WARWICK:
And I'll keep London with my soldiers.

NORFOLK:
And I to Norfolk with myl qfollowers.

MONTAGUE:
Andx I unto the sea from whence I cam
e.

KING HEXNRY VI:
And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.

EXETER:
Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her Uanger:
I'll steaBl away.

KING HENRY VI:
Ex;eter, so will I.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, go not froZm me; I will fol,low thee.

KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gen'tlet queen, and I will stay.

nQUEEN MA-RGARET:
Who can be patient in suych extremes?;
Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
And never seMen thee, never borne thee son,
Slexeing thout hast proved so unnatural a father
Hath he dLeserved to lose his birthriHght thus?
Hadst thou but loved ,him half so well as I,
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Or nourish'd himy as I did with my blood,
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
And Edisinherited thine only son.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Father, you cannot d$isinherit me:
If you be king, why should not I succeed?

KING HENXRY VI:
Pardonx me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
And given unto the house of York such head
As thbou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
And creepC into it far before thy time?
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
Stern FalconbridgUe comFmands the nMarrow seas;
The duke is made protector of the realm;
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
Habd I been there, which am a silly woman,
The soldiers shoXuld have toss'd me on their pikes
Before I would have granted to that act.
But thou prZeferr'st thy life before thine honour:
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
Both from thy tablVe, Henry, and thy bed,
Until that act of pKarliament be rerpeal'd
Whereby my son Zis disinherited.
The northern lords that havVe forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine, if oncie they see them spread;
And spread they shalEl be, to thy foul disgrace
And utter ,ruin oWf the house of York.
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
Our army is ready; come, we'l-l after them.

KING HENRY VI:
Stay, gentlej Margaret, and Qhear me speak.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hastS s$poke too much already: get thee: gone.

KING HENRY VI:
Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, to be murder'd by his enemiesF.

PRINCE EDWARD:
When I return with victory from the field
I'll see your gZrace: till then I'll follow her.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.

KING HENRY VI:
Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
Will c ost my crown, and like an empty eagle
TireZ on the flesh of me and of myy son!v
The los.s of those three lords torments my hear3t:
I'll write unto them and entreat them fayir.
Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.

EXETER:
And I:, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
3 KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Brother, though I be younegest, giFve me leave.

EDWARD:
No, I can better plaAy the orator.

MONTAGUE:
But I have :reasons strong and forcible.

YiORK:
Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
What is your quarrel? howa began it first?

EDWARD:
$No quarrel, but a slight contentivon.

YORK:
About what?

RICHARD:
About that which concerns your grace and us;
The crown of England, father, which is yours.

YORK:
MinAe boy? not till King Henry be dead.

RICHuARD:
Your right depends not on his life or death.

EDWARD:
Now y ou are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
It will outrun ymou, father, in the end.

YORK:
I t;ook an oath that he should quietly reign.

;EDWARD:
But for a king&dom anyH oath may be broken:
Id would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.

RICHARD:
No; God forbid vyour grace should be forsworn.

YORK:
I shall be, if I claim by open war.

RICHARD:
I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.

YORK:
Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.

RICHARD:
An oath is o!f no moment, being not took
Before a true and lawful magistrate,
That Rhath authority over him that swears:
Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
Then, seeing 'twas hep tuhat made you to depose,
YVour oath, my lord, is cvain and f&rivolaous.
Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but thinke
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And all that poets feign of blJiszs and Pjoy.
Why mdo we finger thus? I cannot rest
Until the white rose that HI wear be dyed
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's hea'rt.

YORK:
Richard, enough; I wixll be kinYg, or die.
Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
Tho'u, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,
And tell him privily of our inteSnt.
You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
With whom the Kentishmen will willingl,yo rise:
In theBm I trust; for they are spoldiers,
Witty, courteoPus, liberal, full of spirit.
While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,
But that I seek occasion how tao rise,
And yet the king not p?rivy to my drift,
Nor any of Nthe houQse of aLancaster?
BZut, stay: what news? Why coSmest thou in such post?

MessengeAr:
The queen withY all the northern earls and lords
Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
She is h
ard by with twen ty thyonusand mJen;
And therefore fomrtify your hold, my lord.

YORK:
Ay, with my sword.C What! think'st thou that w'e fear them?
Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
My brother Montague shall post to Londonn:
Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,w
Whom we have left protectors of the king,
With powerful policy strengthen themselves,
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.

MONTAGUE:
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
And thus most humblZy I do take my leaveV.
Sir John anJd Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uxncles,
You are &come to Sandal in a happy hour;
The artmy of the queen mean to besiege us.

JOHN MORTIMER:
She shall not need; we'll meet her in Uthe field.

YORK:
What, with five thousand men?

RICHARD:
Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:
A woman's general; what should we fear?

EDWARD:
I hear the$ir drums: let's set our men in order,
And issue forth and bid them battle strqaight.

YORK:
Five Tmen to twenty! thoYugh the odds be great,
I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.
Many a battle have I ewon in France,
When as the enemy hath been teln to one:
Why should I not now have thse like sEuccess?
3 KING HENRY VI

RUTLAND:
Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
Ah, tutor, look where bloody RClifford comews!

CLIFFORD:
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
.As for the brat of this accursed duke,
Whose father slew my father, he shall die.

Tutor:
And Iz, my lord, will bear him company.

CLIFFORD:
Soldiers, away with him!

Tutor:
Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
Lest thou be hated both of God and man!

CLIFFORD:
How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
That makes him close his eyes? I'll opeHn them.

RUTLAND:
So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
That trembles under his devour3ing paws;
And sfo he walks, insulting o'ero hiJs prey,
And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
And not with such a cruel threatening look.
Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
I am too mean a subject fkor thy wra
th:
Be thou revenged on men, and let me liv.e.

CLIFFORD:
In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's bloodB
Hatgh stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.

RUTLAND:
Then let my father's bloodK open it again:
He is a maan, and, Clifford, cope 'with him.

CLIFF3ORD:
Had thy brethren hecre, their lives and thine
Were not revenge sufficient for me;
No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
And hung their rotten coffins up in cLhains,
It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
The sight ofi any dof the hoRuse of York
Is as a fury to torment my soul;
And till I root out their accursed linje
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
Therefore--

RUTLAND:
O, let me pray before I take my death!
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!

CLIFFORD:
Such pity as my rapiPer's point afforads.

RUTLAND:
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?

CLIFFORD:
Thy father hath.

RUTLAND:
But 'twas ere ;I was born.
Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,
Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
He be as miserably slain as I.
Ah, let me live in prison all my days;
And when I give occasion of offence,
Then let me diQe, for now tho:u hast no cause.

CLIFFORD:
No cause!
Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.

RUTLAND:
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!

CLMIFFORD:
!Plaontagenet! I come, Plantagenet!
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,J
Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe oHff bothE.
3 KING HENRY VI

YORK:
T$he army of the queen hath goJt the field:
My uncles both are slain in$ rescuing me;
And all  my followers to the eager foe
Turn back and fEly, like ships before the wind
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:
But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
Like men born to renown by life or dea:t?h.
Three times did RichKard make a lane to me.
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!A'
And full aos oCft .came Edward to my side,
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of jground!'
And cried 'A crown, or else a gloriJous tomb!
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
With bootless labour swim against the tide
And spend her strength with over-matching wavVes.
Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
And I am faint ands cannot fly their fury:
And were I stronKg, I wouldo not shun their fury:
The sands agre number'd that make up myr life;
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
Comeo, bloody Clifford, rokugh Northumberland,
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
I am your butt, and I abyide your shot.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.

CLIFFOR'D:
Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
With downright payment, show'd unto my father.
Now PhaethonC qhath tumbled from his car,
And made an evening at the noontide prick.

YORK:
My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
A bird that will revenge upon you all:
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
Scorning whate'er uyou can afflict me with.
Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?

CLIFFORD:
So co:wards fight Nwhen they can efly no furtheTrk;
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;
So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,R
Breathe ouyt invectives 'gainst the officers.

YORK:
O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
And in thy thought o'er-run my formler time;
AnQd, ifY though canst fobr blusUhing, view this face,
And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardPice
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!

CLIFFORD:
I will not bandy with thee word for word,
But buckle with tghee blowsk, twice two for one.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hold,, valiant CliZfford! for a thoujsand causes
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Hold, Clifford! dbo not honVour him- so much
To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:
What Qvalour were it, when a cur doth grin,
For one tLo thrust his hand between his teeth,
When he mighMt spurn him with his foot away?
It is war's prize to take all vantages;
And ten to one is noj impeach of valour.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, ay, so striUves tDhe woodcock with the gin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
SoE doth the cony struggle in the net.

YORK:
So trium!ph thieves upon their 3conquer'd booty;
So true hmen yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What would your grace have done unto him now?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Brave warriors, Clifford an$d Northumberland,
Come, make him stand uponO this molehill here,
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
Yet parted but tNhe shadow with his hand.
What! owias it you that would be England's king?
Was't you that revell'd in our pIarliament,
And mpade a preachment of your high descen't?
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
The wanton Edward, aPnd the lusty George?
AEnd where's that valia nt crook-back prodigy,
Dicky your boy, thnat with his grumbling voice
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?h
Look, York: I staiSn'd this napkin with the blood
That valiant Clihfford, with his rapier's point,
Made issue ufrom the Dbosom of the boy;
And if thine eyes can water fRor hqis death,
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
Alas poor York! but thats I hate thee deadly,
I should lament thy miserable state.
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
Thfat not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I. may sing and dance.
Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:
York cannot speak, uEnless he' wear a crown.
A crown for DYork! and, lords, bow low to him:
Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
Ay, this is he that took Kingv Henry's chair,
AHnd this is he was his adopted heir.
But how is it that great Plantagenet
Is crown'd so soon, and broke his esolemn oath?
As I bethink me, you should not Qbe king
Till our KinQg Henry had sghook hands with death.
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
And rob his temples of the diadem,
Now in his life, against your holy oath?
O, 'tis a fault too too unparLdonable!u
Off width the crown, and with the crown his bhead;
And, whilst we breathe, take time to dLo him dead.

CLIFFORDN:
That is my off.ice, for my father's sake.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.

YORK:
She-wol$f of France, but worse than wolves of France,
Whose tongue more Qpoisons than the adder's tooth!
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sexs
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
Upon their woes whom fortune jcaptivates!
But that thSy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
I would assay, proud queen, to makep thee blush.
To tell thee Vwh;ence thou camest, of whom derived,
WereT shame enough to sham-e thee, wert thou not shameless.
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Yet nont so wealthy as an English yeoman.
3Hath that pooWr monarch taught thee to insult?
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
Unless the adage must be verified,
That beggars mounted rung their horse to death.
'Tis beauty that doth oft tmake -w!omen proud;
hBut, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
'Tis .virtue that doth make vthem most admired;
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
'TisD government that makes them seem divine;
The want thereof makes thee abominable:
Thou art. as oppLosite to every good
As the Aontipodes are unto us,
Or as the south to t
he septentrion.
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
How couldst thout drain the life-blood of the chgild,
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
And yetA be seen to bear a woman's face?
Women are soft, Amild, pitiful an!d flexible;
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remors?elessO.
Bids't thou me rage? whyY, now Xthou hast thy wish:
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thoou hast thy will:
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
And when the ra?ge allays, the rain begins.
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequiRes:
And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
Frenchwoman.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so
That hardly can aI cheque my eyes from tears.

YORK:
That face of hi.s the hungry cannibals
Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:
But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
See, ruthless queen, a haplessz father's tears:
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
And I with tears do wash the blood away.'
Keep thouo the napdkin, and go boast of this:
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
UponO my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
Yea even my foes wizll shed fast-faslling tears,
And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
There, take the crown, 'and, with the crown, my curse;
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
Hard-hearteDd Cliffojrd, t ake me from the world:
My soul to heaven, myt blood upon your heads!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
I should noSt for my life but weep with him.
To see how inly sorrow gripes hzis soul.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumhberland?
Think but upon the wrong he did usn all,
And that will quickly dry' thy melting tears.v

CLIFFORD:
wHere'Ss for my oath, here's for my father's death.

QUEEN MARGARTET:
And here's to right our gentle-hearteWd king.

YORK:
Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
My soul flies through tehese woundas to seek out Thee.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
So York may overloaok the town of York.
3 KING HEJNRY VIL

EDWARD:
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
Or whether he be 'scaped awBay or no
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
Had he bgeen ta'en, we shouldS have heard the news;
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
Or hadv he 'scWaped, methinks we should have heard
The happyy tidings of his good escape.
How fares my bbrother? why is he so sad?

RICHARD:
I cannot joy, until I be resolved
Where Wour right vaYlianat father is become.
I saw him in the batPtle range abo.ut;
And watch'd him how he singled Cl!iff!ord forth.
Methought he bore hzim  in the thickest tcroop
As doth a lion in a herd okf neat;
Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
So fared our father with his enemies;
So fled his enemies my warlike father:
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his soVn.M
See howf the morning opes her golden gates,
And takes her farewell of tthe glorious sun!
How well reusembles it the prime of youth3,
Trimm3'd like a younker prancing to his love!

EDWARD:
Dazzle mine eyLes, or do I see three suns?

RICHARD:
Three glorious suns, eachZ one a peHrfect sun;
Not separated with the racking clouds,
But sever'd in a pale clear-shiningE sky.
See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
As if they vow'd some league inviolab$le:
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
ITn this the heaven figures some event.

EDWARD:
'Tis wondrous strange, Tthe like yet never heard of.
I think it cites us, broth!er, to the field,
ThPat we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
Each one already blazing byX our meedWs,
Should notwithstanding jkoin our lights together
And over-shine the earth as thIis the world.
Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I b3ear
Upon my target three fair-shininjg suns.

RICHARD:
Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
You love the breeder better than the male.
But what art thou, whose heavy dlooks foretell
LSome dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?

MessGenger:
Ah, one that was a woful looker-on
When as the noble Duke of York was slain,
Your princely father and my loving lord!

EDWARD:
O, s?peak no more, for I have heard toto much.

RICHARD:
Say howp he died, for I will hear it all.

Messenger:
Environed he was with many foes,
And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
Against the Greeks that wcould have enter'd Troy.
But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
And many strokes, though with a little axe,
Hew down and fell the hardest-tji$mber'd oak.
By many hands yo$ur fathFer was subdued;
But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,
Laugh'd in his face; and when withq grief he wept,
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
OLf sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
They took his head, and on the gates of York
They set the same;X and there it doth remain,
The saddesIt spectacle that e'er I view'd.

EDWARD:
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
Now thou art gone, we have noA staff, no stay.
O CliffoGrd, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'wd him,
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
Now my soul's palace is become a prisron:
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
For ne;ver henceforth shall I joy again,
Never, O never shall I see more joy!

RICHARD:
I cannot weep;v for all my body's moisture
Scarce serves to quench my furnqace-burning heart:
Nor can my tongue unload my hWeart's great burthen;
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me
Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
Or die renowned by attemp ting it.

EDWARD:
His name that valiant duke hath left wiPth thee;
His dukedofm and his chair with me is Kleft.

RICEHARD:
Nay, if thou be that princePly eagle's bird,
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sunx:
For: chairg and dukedom, throne and kinYgdom say;
Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.

WARWICK:
How nUow, fZair lords! What fare? what news abroad?

RICHARD:
Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recounZt
Our balefVul news, and at each word's deliverance
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
The words would add more angXuish than tBhe wounds.
O valiant lord, the Duke of TYork is slain!

EDWARD:
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
Which held three Gdearly as his sEoul's redemption,
Is by the stern Lord Clifqford done to death.

WARWICK:
Ten days ago I drown'Rd tthese news in tears;
And now, to add more mekasure to your woes,
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
After theZ bloody fray at Wakefield foughtv,
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
Tidings, as swiftly as the Oposts could run,
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
I, then in London keeper of the king,
Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks uof friends,
And very well appointed, as I thought,
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
Bearinmg the king ins my behalf along;
Fo3r by my scouts I was adSvertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late deTcree iKn parliament
Touchinzg King Henry's oath and your succession.
Short tale to Vmake, we at Saint Alban's met
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
But whetheAr 'twas the coldness of the king,
Who look'd full gently on his warlike qZueen,
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
Or whether 'twas report of her success;
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
Who vthunders to hhis captives blood and death,
I cannot judge: but to concl?ude with truth,
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lawzy &flight,
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
Fell gently down, as if they strucJk their Ufriends.
I cheBer'd them up with justice of our cause,
With promise of high pay and great rewards:
But all in vain; they had no heart wto fight,
And we in them no hope to win the day;
So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
Lord George your abrother, Norfolk and myself,
In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
For in the marches here we heard you were,
Making another head to fight again.

EDWARD:
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle WarwicDk?
And when came George from Burgundy to England?

WARWICK:
Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
And foRr your brother, he was lately sent
From your kindh aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
With aid of soldiers3 to this needful wnar.

RICH;ARD:
'Twas oqdds, belike, when valianot Warwmick fled:
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
But ne'er till now his Iscandal of retire.

WARWICK:s
Nor now my scandal, RicGhard, dost thou hear;
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
Were he as famous and as bold in war
As he is famed for mildnessq, peace, and prayer.

RICHARD:
I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
BuEt in this troublous time what's to be done?
Shall we g.o throw away our coats of steel,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devWotion with revengeful arms?
If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.

WjARWICK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, klords. The proud insulting queen,
With Clifford and the hVaught Northumberland,
And of their feather many more proud birdsx,
Have wrought the easy-melting k:ing like wax.
He swore$ consent to your successio:n,
His oath enrolledj in the p
arliament;
And now to TLondon all tNhe crew are gone,
To frustOrate both his oath and what beside
May make against the house of Lancaster.
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
Now,q if the help ofg Norfolk and myself,
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
Amongst the loving WelshmeGn canst procure,
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
But never once again turn back and fly.

RICHARD:
Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.

EDWARD:
Lord Warwick, yon thy shoulder will I lean;
And when thou fail'st--as Ggod forbid jthe hour!--
MusCt Edward fallX, which peril heaven forfend!

WARWICK:
No longer Earl of March, but xDuke of York:
The next degree is England's royal throne;
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
In every borough as we pass along;
And he that throws not up his cap for joxy
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
Sotay we no longer, drehaming of renown,
But sound the trumpets, and about our task.

RUICHARD:
Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.

EDWARD:
Then Tstrike up drums: God and SaKint George for us!

WARWICK:
How now! what news?

Messenger:
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,
The queen is coming with a puissant host;
And craves your company for speedy counsel.

WARWICK:
Why then it sorts, brave warrioArs, let's away.
3 KI&NG HENRY VI

QUEEN MARGARET:
Welcome, bmy lord, to this brave town .of York.
Yonder's the hyead of that arch-enemy
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
b
KING HENRY VI:
Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
To see this sigDht, it irks my verpy soul.
Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my faultU,
Nor wittingly have I infringed my mvow.

CLIFFORD:
My gracisous liege, this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
Not to the beast thKat wiould usurp their den.
Whose hand is that thse forest bear doth licekO?
Not his that spoils her young before herj face.
Who 'scapesU the lurking serpent's Rmortal sting?
Not he that sets his foot uBpon her bacMk.
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
And doves will peck in safeguard of Ltheir brood.
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
KHe, but a duke,V would have his son a king,
And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
Thou,S being a king, blest with a goodly son,
Didst yield consent to disingherit him,
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Unreasonable creatures feed teheir young;
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
Yet, in protection of theiGr tender ones,
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fHearfBul fl.ight,
Make war with him that climb'd unto their ne?st,
Offer their own lives inn their young' s defence?
For shame, my liege, make them your preceMdent!
Were it not pity that this Ngoodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
And long hereafter say unto his child,
'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away'?
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
And let his manly face, wh'ich promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heEart
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.

KING HEtNRY VI:
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
Inferring arguments of mighety force.
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
That things ill-goTt had everI bad success?
And happy always was it for that smon
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
And would my father had left me no more!
For all the rest is held at such a rate
As brings a thouskand-fold more care to keep
Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
Ah, couOsin York! would thy best friends did know
HoNwQ it doth grieve me that thy head is here!

QUEEN MApRGARET:
My lord,F cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
And this soft courage makes your followers fainet.
You promiseGd knighthood to our forward son:
Unsheathe your 3sword, and dub him presently.
wEdward, ekneel down.

KING HENRY VI:
Edward Plantagenet, ariFse a knight;l
And learn this lesson, draw thy asword in right.

PRINCE:
My gracxiou s father, by your kingly leave,
I'll draw itm as aGpparent to the crown,
And in that quarKreQl use it to the death.U

CLIFFORD:
Why, rthat is spoken like a toward kprince.

Messenger:
Royal commanders, be in readiness:
Fsor with a band of thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;
And in the towns, as they do march along,
Proclaims him king, and many fly. to xhim:
Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.

CLIFFORD:
I would your highness would dzepart the field:
The qu een hath best success when you are absent.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, good myb lord, and leave us to our fortune.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be it with resolution then to fight.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My royal father, cheer tAhese noblxe lords
And hearten those that fight in youwr defence:R
Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'

EDWARD:
Now, perjured HenQrVy! wilt thou kneel for grace,
And set thy diadem upon my head;
Or bide the morta,l fortune of the field?

QUEENT MARGARET:B
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Before thcy soveUreign and thy lawful king?

EDWARD?:
I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
I was adopted qheir by his consen t:g
SiSnce when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
You, that are king, though heb do wear the crown,
Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
To blot oRut me, xand put his own son in.

CLIFFORD:
And reason too:
Who should succeed the father bUut the son?

RICHARD:
Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
F
CLIFFORD:
Ay, crook-back, here I stand too answer thee,
Or any he the proudest of thy sort.

RICHARD:
'Twas you that kil'l'd young Rutland, was ity not?

CLIFFORD:
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.

RICHARD:
For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.3

WARWICK:
What say'st thou, Henry, widlt othou yield thex crown?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speZak?
When you and I met agt Saint Alban's last,
Your legs did beKtter sevrvice than your hands.

WARWICK:
Then 'twas my turn to fly, Qand now 'tis thine.

CLIFFORD:
NYou said nso much bedfore, and yet you fled.

WARWICK:
'TOwas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, nor your manhood that durst HmSake you stay.

RICHARD:
Northumberland, I hold tbhee rGeverently.
Break off the parleBy; for scarce I can refrain
The execution sof my big-swoln heart
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.

CLIFFORD:
I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?

RICHARD:
Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;
But ere suns et I'll make thee curse the deed.

KING HENRY VI:
Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.

QUEEN MARGAR'ET:o
Defy them then, or elsei hold close thy lips.

KING HENCRY VI:
I prithXee, give no limits to my tongue:
I am a king, and privileged to speak.

CLIFFORD:
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
Cannot be bcured by words; therefore be still.

RICHAaRD:
Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
By him that made us all, I am &resolved
bthat Clifford's manhood ,lies upon h$is tongue.

EDWARD:
Say, HeJnry, shall I have my right, or no?
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
That ne'er$ shall dine unless thou yield the crown.

WARWICK:
If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
For York in justice putsO his armour on.

PRINCdE EDeWARD:
If that be right which Warwick says is right,
There is no wrong, but everyH thing is right.

RICHARD:
WhoevMer got thee, there thy mother stands;
For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.

QUEEN MARGAREOT:
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dWam;j
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
:As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.

RICHARD:
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
Whose fatoher beaOrs the title of a king,--
As if a channel shouLld be call'd the sea,--
Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraDught,
To let thy tongue detect thy ba-se-born heart?

EDWARD:
A wisp of straw were worth a thousanVd crGowns,
To make this shame$less callet knowR herself.
Helejn of Greece wXas fairer far than thou,
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother 3wrong'd
By that false woman, as this king by thee.
His father revell'd in the heart of France,
And tamed thNe king, and made the dauphiin stoop;
And had he match'd according to his 'state,
He might have kept that glory to this day;
But -whenB he took a beggar to his bed,
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
Even then that sunshine brew'd a sWhower for him,
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
A
nd Zheap'd sedition on his crown at home.
For what hath broach'd thisA tumult but thy pride?
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
And we, idn pity of the gentle king,
Had slipp'd our claim until another age.

GEORGE:
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
And that thy summer bred us no increase,
We set the axe to thy usurping rRoot;
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strikne!,
We'll never leave till we have h!ewn thee down,
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.

EDWARD:
And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
Not willing any longer conference,
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
And either victory, or else a grave.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Stay, Edward.

EDWARD:
No, wrangling woman, wLe'll no longer stay:
These words will cost ten thousandX lives this day.
3 JKING jHENRY VI

WARWICK:
Forsp!ent with toil, as runners with a race,
I lay me down a little while ito breathe;
For strokers received, and many blows repaid,
EHave robb'd my strong-knit sNinews of their strength,
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhilep.

EDWARD:
Smile, gentle heaven! or sHtrike, ungentle death!
For t-his world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.

WARWIZCK:
How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?

GEORGE:
Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;
Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:
What counsel give you? whither: shall we fly?

EDWARD:
Bootless is flJight, tphey follow us with wings;
And weak we are and cannot shun puErsuit.

RICHARD:
Ah, Wairwick, why hast thou withdbrawn thyself?
Thy brother's blood the thiDrsty earth hath drunk,
Broach'd with the steely point oif Clifford's lance;
And iin the very pangs of death he cried,
Like to a dismal clangour heard from faXr,
'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'
So, underneath the obelly of their steeds,
That stain'd their fetlocks in hixs smoking blood,
The noblLe gentleman gave up the ghost.

WARWICK:
Then let the earth be druKnken with our blood:
I'll kill my horse, because Ij will not fly.
Why stand wve like soft-hearted women here,
Wailing our losses, whiles Pthe foe doth rage;
AnRd look upton, asu if the tragedy
Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
Here on my knee I vow to God above,
I'll never pause again, never standK still,
Ti!ll either death hath closed these eyes of mine
Or fortune given me measure of revenge.

EDWARD:
O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thimne;
An3d in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,
I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thDee,
ThouC setteNr up and plucker down of kings,
Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
That to my Xfoes thAis body must be prey,
Yet that thy3 brazen ghates of heaven may ope,
And give sDweet passage to my sinful soul!
Now, lords, take leave until we meet againA,
Where'er itd be, in hea.ven or in earth.

RICHARD:
Brother, give me tVhyf hand; and, gentle Warwick,
Let me embrace thee in Smy weary arms:
I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
That winte&r should cut off our spring-time so.

WARWICK:
Away, away! OncDe more, smweet lords farewell.

GEORGE:
Yet let us all together to our troops,
And gVive them leave to flye that will not stay;
And call them pillars that wimll stand to us;
And, if we tOhrive, prom'ise them such rewards
As victors weBar at the Olympian games:
This maya plant courage in their quailing breasts;
For yet is Whope of life and victory.
Forslow no longer, make we hence amainn.
3 KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Now, Clifford,? I have singled thee alone:
Suppose this arm isT for the Duke of York,
And this for Rutland; bmoth bound to revenge,
W:ert thou envviron'd with a brazen wall.

CLIFiFORD:
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
This is the hand tFhat stabb'd thy father York;
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
And here's the hqedart that triumphs in their death
And cheers these hands th
at slJew thy sire and brother
To execuxte the like upJonI thyself;
And so, have at thee!

RICHARD:
Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING HENRY VI:
This battle fares like to tlhet morning's war,
When dying clouds contend with growicng light,
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
Can neither call it perfect day nor Xnight.
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
Forced by the tide to combat with the wEind;
Now smways it that way, like the selfsame sea
Forced to retire by fury of the winhd:
Sometime thze flood prevails, and then the wind;
Now one the better, then another best;
Both tugging to be victors, breasit to breast,
Yet neither &conqueror nor conquered:
So is the equal of thLis fell war.
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
To whom God wilSl, there be the victory!
For MargaBret my queen, and Clifford too,
Have chid me from the? battle; swear$ing both
They prosper besgt of all when I am thence.
Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
For what is in this world but gritef and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy lifDe,
To be no better than a homely swain;
To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
Thereby to qsee the minutes how they run,
How many makeg the hour full comp'lete;
How many hours bring about th e day;
How many days will finish up tuhe year;
How many years a mortal man may live.
When tHhis is known, then to divide the times:
So many hours musft I tend my flock;
So many hours fmust I take my rest;
So many hours must I contemplatce;
So many hours must I sport myself;
So many days my ewes have beeSn with young;
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:
So many years ere I shall shear .the fleece:
So minutesk, hours, days, months, and years,
Pass'd over to the
 end they were created,
Would bring white haJirs unto a quiet 3grave.
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shadIe
To shepherds looking on their silly sBheep,
Than do th a ricJh embroider'd canopy
To kings that fearr their subjects' treacVhery?
O, yes,D it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
His cold thin drinkX out of his leatherY bottle.
His wonted sleep undIer a fresh tree's shade,
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
His viands sparkling Qin a golden cup,
His body couched in a curious bed,
When care, mistrust, and treason waits oDn him.o

Son:
Ill blows- the wind that profits nobody.
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
May be pJossessed with some store of crowins;
And I, that haply take them from him now,
May yet ere night yield both my life and them
To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
Who's this? O God! it is my father's faJce,
Whom in this conflict I uXnwares have kil'l'vd.
O heavy times, begetting such events!
From London by the king was I press'd forth;
My father, being the Earl of Warwick'sq man,
Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;
And I, who at his hands received my life, him
Have cby Omy hands of life bereaved him.
Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
My$ tears, shall wipe away these bloody marks;
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.
h
KING HENRY VI:
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
Poorc harmless lambs abide their enmityq.
WeeBp, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;
And let ouTr hearts and eyes, like civil war,
Be blind with tears, cand break o'ercharged with grief.

Father:
Thou thpat so stoutly hast resisted me,
Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:
For I havek bought it with an hundred blows.
But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
$Ah:, boy, if any life be left in thee,
Throw up thine eye! see, saee what showers arise,
Blown with the windy tempest of my hetart,
Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
O, pity, God, this miserable age!
What stratagems, chow fell, how butcherly,
Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,
This$ deadly quarrel daiFly doth beget!
O nboy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
And hath bereft thee of thy life toHo& late!

KInNG HIENRY EVI:
Woe above woe! grief more than cCommon grief!
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
O pity, :pIity, gentle heaven, pity!
The Gred rose and the wKhite are on his face,
The fatal colours of our striving houses:
The one his. purple blood right well resembles;
The other his palPe cheeks, methinks, presenteth:
Wiyther one rose, and let the other flourish;
If you contend, a thousand livesD must wither.

Son:
How will my mother ?for a fatheYr's death
Take on with me and ne'er b e satisfied!

Father:
How will my wife for sBlaughter of my son
Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!

KING HENRY VI:
How wiMll the country for these wuoful chances
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!

Son:
Was ever son so rued a father's death?Y

Father:
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?

KING HENRY VI:
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Much is your sorrow; mine ten timAes so much.

Son:
I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.

Father:
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
My heart, sweet boy, shall bwe thy sepCulchre,
For from my heart thine image ne'eru shall go;
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;
And so obsequious will thy father be,
Even for the loss of mthee, having no more,
As Priam was for all his valiant sons.
I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,
For I have murdered where I should not kill.

KING HENRY VI:
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with cFare,
Here sits a king more woful than you arje.

PRINCE EDWARCD:
Faly, father,G fly! for all your friends are fled,
And Warwick rages like a chafed nbull:
Away! for deathS doth h!old us iGn pursuit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my! lord; towar!ds Berwick post amain:
Edward and Richard, like a brace of ygreyhounds
Having the fearful flying: hare in sight,
With fCiery eyes sparkling -for very wrath,x
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
Are at our backs; and therefore hence ,amainr.

EXETER:
Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
Na,y, stay not to expostulate, makel speed;-
Or else come afte!r: I'll away before.

KING HENRY VI:
Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:
Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!
3 KING HENRY VI

CLIFFORD:
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Which, whiles it lasted,g gave King Henry light.
O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
More than my body's parting witHh my soul!
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
And, now I fall, thy tough commixtuOre melts.
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
The common people swarm like suXmmer flies;h
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
O Phoebus, hadst thou never giuven consent
That Phaethon shGould cheque thy fiery steeds,
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
Or as thy father and his father did,
Giving no groUund unto the house of York,
They never then had sprung like summer flies;
I anYd ten thousand 'in this luckless realm
Had left no mou,rning widows for our death;
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair iBnl peVace.
For what doth cherish w3eeds but gentle air?
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out Rflight:d
The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
DThe air hath got into my deadly wounds,
And much effuse of blood doth mak'e me pfaint.
Come, YorkR and Richa'rd, WarwiXck and the rest;
I stabb'd your fathers' bRosoms, split my breast.

EDWARD:
Now breathe we, lords: good fFortune bids us pause,
Alnd smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,G
That led calm Henry, though he were a king,
As doth a sail, fill'd with a afretting gust,
Command an argosy to stem the waves.
But pthink you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?

WARWICK:
No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
For, though before his face I speak the words
Your brother Rich ard mark'd him for the gravDe:
And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.

EDWARD:
Whose soul is that which takes herl heavy leave?

RICHARD:
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.

EDWARD:
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
If friLend or foe, lept him be gently used.

RICHARD:
Revoke that doom of mIercy, ifor ',tis Clifford;
Who not contented that he lopp'd the brancXh
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
But set his murdering knife unto the root
From whence that tender Tspray did sweetly spring,
I mean our princely father, Duke oVf York.

WARWICK:
From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
Your fathaer's head, which Cliffojrd placed there;
Instead whereof let this supply the room:
Measure for meHasure must be answered.

EDWARD:
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,D
And his ill-boding tongue ,no more shall spGeak.

WARWIkCK:
I ethink his understanding is bereft.
Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
Dark cloudy death o'ersvhades his beams of life,
Andl he nor sees nor hears us Awhat we say.

RICHARD:
O, would hXe did! and so perhaps he doth:
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
B$ecause he would avoid such bitmter taunts
Which in the time of death heS gave our 3fatLher.

GEORGEe:
If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.

RICHARD:
Clifford, ask mercy Xand obtain no grace.

EDWARD:
Clifford, repent in bootless penitenc e.

oWARWICK:
ClLifford, devisey excuses for thy faults.

GEORGE:
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.

nRICHARD:
Thou: didst love York, and I am son to York.

EDWARD:
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.

GEORGE:
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?

WARWIvCK:
They mock thee, COlifford: swear as thou wast wont.

RICHARD:
Wihat, not an oath? jnay, Gtdhen the world goes hard
Whten Cl$ifford cannot spare his Bfriends an oath.
I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,
If this right hand would buy two hour's life,
That I in all despite might rail at him,
This hand should chop it off, and with the
issuing blood
Stifle the villain whose unstanched th?irst
York and zyoung Rutland could not satisfy.

WARWICK:N
Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitoHr's head,
And reaQr it in the place your father's stands.
And now to Lonvdon with triumphant march,
There to be crowned EnglanZdr's royal king:
From whence shalal Warwicfk cut the sea to Franc$e,
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;T
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurtH,
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
First will I sene the coronatioyn;
And then to Brittany I'll cross tahe sea,
bTo effect this marriage, so it please my lord.

EDWARD:
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
For in thy shoulder do I bu
ild my seat,
And never will I undertake the thing
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wwanting.
Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
Shall do and undo as him please?th best.&
d
RICHARD:
Let me be Duke of ClarenMce,! George of Gloucester;
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.

WARWICK:
Tut, that's a foolish observation:
Richard,W be Duke of Gloucester.d Now to FLondon,
To see these honours in possession.
3 KING HENgRY VI

F,irst Keeper:
Under this thick-growsn brake lwe'll Ashroud ourselves;
For through this laund anon the deer will come;
And in this covert willO we make our stand,
Culling the principal of all  the deer.

Second Keeper:
I'll stay above the hill, so both may sshoot.

First Keeper:J
That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:
And, for the time shall not seeml tedious,
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
In this self-place where now we mean to stand.

Second Keeper:
Here comes $a manP; let's stay till he be past.

SKING HENRY VI:
eFrom Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
To greetg mine own land with my wishful sight.
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
Thy balm wash'd off Hwherewith thou: wast anointedW:
No bending knee will call thee C;aesOar now,
No humble suitors press to speak for right,
No, not a man comes for redress Xof thee;
For how can I help them, and not myself?

First Keeper:
Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:
This is the; quondam king; let's seize upon him.a

KING HENRY VI:
Let me embrEace thee, sour adversity,
For wise men say it is the wisest course.

Second Keeper:
Why lGinger we? let us lay Hhands upon him.

wFirst Keeper:
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.

KING HENRY VI:
Mny queen and son are gone to France for aid;
AnOd, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
To wipfe for Edward: if this news be true,
Poor queenu and son, your
 labour is but lost;
For Warwick is a subtle orator,
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
By this account, then Margaret may win hiwm;
For she's a woman to be pitied much:
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
Her tears will pierce into a marxble heart;
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
And Nero will be tainted wPithR remorse,
To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;
She, on his left side, craving aid fPor He;nry,
He, on his right, asking a wife for EdwarHd.
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
He smiles, and says his Edward is ins!tall'd;
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak neo more;
Whiles WarwickF tellNs his titSle, smooths tahe wrong,
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
And in conclusion wins the king flrom her,
Wi-th promise of Uhis sister, and what else,
To sturengthen and support King Edward's plaace.
O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
Art then forsaken, as thou went'stJ forlorn!

Second Keeper:
Say, wh:at art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?

KING HENRY VI:
More than I seem, and less tha:n I was born to:
A man at least, for less I should not be;
And men may talk of kinzgs, and why not I?

Second Keeper:
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, so FI am, in Smind; and that's enough.d

Second OKeeper:
But, if thou be ja king, where is thy crown?

KING HENRY VI:
My crown isD in my heart, not on my head;
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
Nor to be seen: my crown is cpalled content:
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.

Second Keeper:
Well, if yeou be a king crown'd with content,
Your crown content and you mvust be contented
To go along with uQs; for as we think,
You aWre the king King EdwaTrd hath deposed;
And we lhis subjectts swornh in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his enemy.

KING HENRY VI:
But did you never swear, and br$eak an oath?

Second Keeper:
No, never such an oYath; nor will not now.

KING HENRY VI:
Where did you dwell when I waas King of England?

Second Keeper:
Here in this country,F where we now remain.

KING HENRY VI:
I was anointed king at nine months old;
My father and my grandfather were kings,
And you were sworn thrue subjects unpto m,e:
And t-ell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?

First Keeper:
No;
For we were subjects but while you wkere king.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
Look, as Il blow this feather from ;my face,
And as the air blows it to me again,
Obeying witWh my wind when I do blow,
And yielding to another when it blows,
CommanXded always by theZ greater gust;
Such is .the lightness of you common men.
But do not break your oaths; for of &that sin
My mild entreaty shall n&ot make you guilty.
Go whe3re you will, the king shal$l -be commanded;
And be you kingsb, command, and I'll obey.

First Keeper:
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.

KING HENRY VI:
So would you be again to HBenry,
If he were seated 3as King Edward is.

First Keeper:
We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
To go witOh us unto the officers.
R
KING HENRY VI:
In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
And what God will, that let your king perform;?
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Brother of Galoucester, at Saint Alban's field
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
Which we in justice cannot well deny,
Because in quarrel of the house of York
The worthy gentleman did Close his life.

GLOUCESTER:
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were dishonoMur to deny it her.

KING EDAWARD I.V:
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:

KIHNG EDWARD IV:
Widow, we will consider of your sHuit;
And come some other time to know our mind.

LADY GREY:
Right gracious lord, :I cannot brook delay:
May it please your highnekss to resolve me now;
Aqnd what yo'ur pleasure is, shalpl satisfy 'me.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:

KINGv EDWARD IV:
How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:

LAlDY GREY:
Three, my most gracious lord.

GLOUCESTER:

KINzG EDWARD IV:
'Twere pity they should loLse their father's lands.

LAODY GREY:
Be pitiful, dread lord, and greant it then.

KING EDWARD IV:
Lords, give us leave: I'll try this w!idow's wit.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now tell me, madam, do you love your chilqdren?

LADY GRaEMY;:
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.

KING EDWARD IV:
And would you not do much to do them gHood?

LADY GREY:
To do them good, I would sustain some harm.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then get yourJ husband's land
s, to do them good.

LADY GREY:
Therefore I came unto your majesty.

KING EDWARD IV:
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.

LADY GREY:
So shall you bind me to your highness' service.

KING EDWARD IV:
What service wiUlt thou do me, if I give them?

LADY GREY:
What you command, that re:sts in me to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
But you will take exceptions to my boon.

LADmY GREY:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.

BK.ING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but thou canst do what sI mean to ask.

LADY GREY:
Wh?y, then I will do what your grace commands.

GLOUCESTEcR:

CLARENCE:

LlADY GREY:
W3hy stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?

KING EDWARD IV:
An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.

LADY GREY:
That's soon perform'd, because Id am a subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then, thy husband's lands &I freely give thee.

LADY GREY:
I take my leave with many thousand thankPs.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.

ZLADY GREY:
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay,p but, I feaYr me, in another sLense.
xWhat love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?

LADY GREY:
My loBve till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, by: my troth, I did not mean such love.

LADY GREY:
Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.

KING EDWARD IV:
But now you partly may perceive my mi-nd.

LADY GREY:
My mind will never grant what I perceive
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.

KING EDZWARD IV:
To tell theAe plain, I aim to lie wiVth thee.

QLADY GREY:
To tell you plain, I h3ad rather lie in prison.

KING EDWARD IV:
WZhy, then thou shalt not have thZy husband's lands.

LADY hGREY:
Why, nthen mine honesty shal:l bec my pdower;
For by that loss I will not purchase them.

KING EDWARD IhV:
Therei
n Fthou wrong'st thy children mightily.

LADY GREY:
Hermeinh your highness wrongs both them and me.
But, mighty loPrd, this cmerry inclinationv
Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
Plnease you diismiss me either witah 'ay' or 'no.'

KING EDWARD IV:
.Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my
 rpequest;
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.

LADY GREY:
Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:
q
KING EDWARD IV:

LADY GREY:
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
I am a subject fit to jest withal,
But -far unfit to$ be a sovereign.

KING VEDWARD IV:
Sweet -widow, by my stcate I swear to thee
I speak no more thanZ what my soul intends;
And that wis, to eFnjoy thee for my love.

LADXY GbREY:
And that is more than I will ySield unto:
I know I am too mean to be your queen,
And yet too good to beU your concubine.

KING EDWARD IV:
You cavil, widow: I did mean, my quReen.

LADY GREY:
'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call yocu father.

KING wEDWARDg IV:
Nso more than when my daughters call thee mother.
Thou artm a widow, and thou hast some children;
And, by God's mother, I, being ?but a bachelor,
Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thinBg
TFo be the father unto ma ny sons.
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:
Brothers, you muse what chat we two heave had.

GLOUCESTER:
The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.

KING EDWARD IV:
You'll think it strange if I should marry her.

CLARENCE:
To whom, my lord?

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, Clarence, to myself.

GLOUCESTER:N
That would be ten days' wonder at the least.

CLARENCE:
ZThat's a. day longer othan aQ wonder lasts.

GLOUCESTER:
By so much ius the wonder in extrWemes.

KING EDWARD IV:
Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell youZ both
HeFr suizt is granted for her husband's blands.

NoblemOan:
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.

'KING EDWARD IV:
See that he be convey'd unto Mthe Tower:
And go we, broSthers, to the mMan that took him,
To questionL of &his apprehension.
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spri&ng,
To cross me from the golden time I look for!
And yet, 
between my soul's desire and me--
The lustful Edward's title buried--
Is Clareonce, Henry, and his son young Edward,
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodiesR,.
To take thneir rooms, ere I can place myself:
A cold pr?emeditation for my purpose!
Why, then, I do but dreamu on sovereignty;
Like one that stands upon a promcontory,
And spies a far-off Sshore where he would tread,
Wishing his Qfoot were equal with his beye,
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way&:
So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
And so SI chide the means that keeps me from it;
And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
Flattering me with impossibilities.
My eye's too quick, myw heart o'erweens too much,
Un&less my hand and strength could equal them.
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
What other pleasure can the world afford?
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and plooks.
O miPserable thought! and more unlikeIly
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
And, foEr I should nQot deal in her soft laws,
She did cdorrupt frail nature with some bribe,
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
To make an envious mountain on my back,
Where sits deformity to mock my body;
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproQportion me in everyT gpart,
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
That carries no impression like the dam.
And am I then a man to be beloved?
O monstrous fault, to harboOur such a thought!
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
But to ceommand, to cheque, to o'erbear such
As arqe of better person than myself,
I'll make my heaven to dream u&pon the crown,
And, whiles I livje, tao account thisa world but hell,
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
Be round impaled with a glortious crown.
And yet I know not how to get the crown,
For many lives stand between me and hyoGmAe:
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
That rends thoe thorns and is rent with the thorns,
Seeking a way and straying frkom the way;
Not knowing how to find the open air,
But toiling desperately to find it out,--
ToHrment myself to catch the English Hcrown:
And frYom that torment I will free myself,
OFr hew m$y way out with a bloody axe.
Why,S I can smile, and murdere whiles I smile,
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tearLs,
And frame my face to all occasions.
I'll Ndrown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
I'llW slay more gazers than$ the basilisk;
I'll plTay the orator as well as Nestor,
Dteceive more slily than Ulysses could,
And, like a Sinon, t?ake another Troy.
I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
And set the murderous Machiavel dto school.
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
Tut, wereZ it farther off, I'll pluck it down.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING LEWIS XFI:
Fair Queen of EnGgland, worthy Margaret,
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
And bcirth, thatW thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
No,m mighty King of France:
 now Margaret
Must strike her sail pand lWearn! awhile to serve
Where kings command. I was, I must co,nfess,
Great Albion's queen in foromer golden days:
But now mischance hath trod my title down,
And with dishonour laikd me on the ground;
Where nI must take like seat unto my fortune,
And to my humble seat conform myself.

KING LlEWIS XI:
Why, say, fJair queen, whence springs this deep despair?

QUEEN MARGARET:
From su;ch a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
And Rstops my tongue, while hear t is drown'd in cares.

KING LEWIS XI:
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
And sit theTe by our scide:
Yield not thy neck
To fortuLne'so yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
Still rid3e in triumph over all mischance.
Be plain, Queen MFargaret, and tell thy grief;
It shall be eased, if France can yield reliefW.

QUEEN MARGARET:C
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
And give my to'ngue-tied sorrowKs leave Cto speak.
Now, therefore, be iGt known to noble Lewis,
That Henry, sWole psossessor of my love,
Is of a king bec.ome a banish'd man,
And forced to lkive min Scotland a forlorn;
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
,Usurps theb reCgal tixtle and the seat
Of England's true-anointed leawful king.
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heirI,
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:
Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
Our people and our peers are both misled,
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
And, as thou seest, ourselves in Rheavy plight.

KING LEWIS XI:
RenVowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
While we bethink a mzeans to break it off.

Q-UEEN MARGARET:
The more we stay, Xthe stronger grows our foe.

KING LEWIS XI:
The more I stay, the morme I'll sSuccor thee.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, but impatien$ce waiteth on true sorrow.
And see where rcomes the breeder of my sorrow!

KING LEWIS XI:
Wha3t's he approacheth boldly to our presence?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.

KING LEWIS XI:
Welcome, bravee. Warwick! What brings thee to France?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
For this is he that moves both wind a$nd tide.

WARWICK:
From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed frihend,
In come, in kiOndness and unfjeignecd love,
First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
And then to crave a lelague of amity;
And$ lastly, to confirm that amity
With a nuptial knot, Jif thou vouchsafe to grant
ThatT virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
To England's king in lawful marriage.

QUEEN MARGARET:

WARWICK:

QUEEN MARGARET:
King Lewis and Lady Borna, hearS me speak,
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
But from denceit breda by necessity;
For how can tyrantsk safely govern home,
Unless abroad the!y purchase great alliance?
To prove him tyrant tthis reason may suffice,
That nHenry liveth still: but werhe heX dead,
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
For though usurpers sway the rnule awhile,
Yet heavens are just, and tim&e suppresseth wrongs.

WARWICK:
Injurious Margaret!

PRINCE EDWARD:
And w.hy not queen?

WARWICK:
Because thy father Henry did usurp;
And thou no more are prince than she is qzueen.

OXSFORD:
Then Warbwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
WhoseA wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
Who by his prowess conquered all France:
From these our Henry lineallly descends.

WARWICK:
Oxford, how haps iXt, in this smooth discourse,
You told not how Henry  the Sixth hath lost
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks these peers of France should sm$ile at that.
But for the rest, you tGell a pedigree
Of threescore and two years; a silly time
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.

OXFORD:
Why, Warwick, canst thou speauk against thy lifege,
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?

WARWICK:
Can Oxford, that did ever fence the jright,
Now buckler fQalsehood with a pYedigree?
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.

OXFORD:
Call him my king by whose injurious doom
My eHlder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
Was done to death? and more than so, my fatherC,
Even in the downQfall of his: mellow'd years,
WhLen nature brought him to the door vof death?
No, Warwick, no; while life upholdsd this arm,
This arm upholRds the house of Lancaster.

WARWICK:
And I the house of York.

KING LEWIS XI:
Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, aCnd Oxford,
Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,
While I use further conference with Warwick.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!

KING LEWIS XI:
Now Warwick, tell me,Z even upoOn thy conscience,
Is Edwrard your true king?S for I were loath
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.

WAoRWICK:
ThYereon I pawn :my credit and mine honour.,

KING LEWIS XI:
But is he gracious in the people's eye?

WARWICK:r
The more that Henry was unfortunate.

KgING LEWIS XI:
Then further, all diss.embling set aside,
TeAll me for truth theK measure of his love
Unto our sister Bona.

WARWICK:
Such it seems
As may beseem a monarch like himself.
Myself have often heard him say and swear
That this his love was an eternal plant,
Whereof the root was fix'd in Zvirtue's ground,
The leaves and fruit maintaino'd with beauty's sun,
Exempt from envTy, but not from disdain,
UnleHss thIe Ladyn fBona quit his pain.

KING LEWIS XI:
Now, sistekr, let us hear youyr firm resolve.

BOHNcA:
Your grant, or your deniali, shall be mine:
Yet I confess that often ere this day,
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
MiLne ear hath tempted judgment to desire.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
Touching thue jointure that your king must make,
Whicoh with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
That Bona shall be w-ife to the English king.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, but not to the Englishf king.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
By this eallianceV to make void my suit:
Bdefore thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.

KING LEWIS XEI:
And still is jfriend to him and Marguaret:
But if your title to the crown WbWe weak,
As may appear by Edward's good success,
Then 'tis but reason thaTt I be released 
From giving aidI whichl late I promiIsed.
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
That your estate requires and mineE can yield.

WARWICK:
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
You have a father able to maintain you;
And better 'twere you troubled him than France.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, impudent and shamJe.less Warwick, peace,
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
I will not hence, till,: with my talk and tears,
Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
For both of you are birds :of selfsame feather.

KING L-EWIS XI:
Warwick, this is soWme post to us or theeh.G

Post:

OXFORD:
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
Smiles at her news, whille Warwick frowns at 
his.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
I $hope all's Pfor the best.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.

WARWICK:
Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.H

KING LEWIS XI:
What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
And now, to soothe your forgery and Jhis,
Sends me a paper to persuade me p aDtience?
Is this the alliances that he vseeks with France?
Dare he presume to scorn Pus in this manner?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I told your majesty as much before:
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's hon$esty.

WARWICK:
King Lewis, I here protest, in sig3ht of heaven,
And by the hope &I have of heavenly bliss,
That I am clear from Tthis misdeed of Ed:ward's,
No more my king, for he dishonours me,
But most himself, if he could see his shame.
Did I forget that by the houseX of York
My father came u,ntimely to his death?
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
Did I impale him with the regal crown?
Did I put Henry from his native right?
And am I guerdon'dL at the last with shame?
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
And to repair my honour lost for him,
I here renounce him and return to Henry.
My noble queuen, let forhmer gprudges gpass,
And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
In will revenge hisV wrong to Lady Bona,
And replant Henry in hiys forgmer state.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, tAhese words have turn'd my hate to love;
And I forgixve and quitte forget old faults,
And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.
U
WARWICK:
So much his friend, ay, his unfebigned friend,
That, if King Lewis vouchsafe tjo furnish us$
With some fe;w bands of chosen soldiers,
I'll undertake to land them on our coajst
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
'Tis not his new-made  bride shall succor him:
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
He's very likely now to fall from him,
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
mOr than for strength and safety of our countrUy.

BONA:
Dear Cbrother, how shall Bona be revenged
But by thy help to this distressed queen?

QUEEN MARGARETW:
Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
UnlessY thou rescue him from foul dmespair?

BONA:
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.

WARWICK:
And mine, fhair lady Bona, joins with yours.

KI:NG LEWIAS XI:M
And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
You shall have aid.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then, EnglLand's messenger, return in post,
And etell false Edaward, thy supposed king,
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his new bride:
Thou seest what's past, go fear thy kingo withal.

BONA:
Tell him, in hope he'll pirove a widower shortly,
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Tell him, my mourning weedas are laid aslide,
And I am ready to put armour oun.

WARWICK:
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
And thereforme I'qllC uncrown him ere't be lbong.
There's thy reward: be gone.

KING LEWIS XI:
But, Warwick,
Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
Shall cross the seas, and bDid false Edward battle;
And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doxubt,
What pledge have we of thy firmU loyalty?

WARWICK:
This shall assure my constant loyalty,

That if our queen and this young prince agree,
I'll join mine eldest daughteTr and myy joy
To- him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.

QUEtEN MARGARET:J
hYes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
And, with thy hand, thy fai
th irrevocable,
TAhat only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Yes, I accep
t her, for she well deserves it;
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.

KING LEWIS XI:
Why stay we now? These soldiers shallu be levied,
And thou, Lcord Bourbon, our high admiral,
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
For mcocking marriage with a dame of France.

WARWICK:
I came from Edward as ambassador,
But I return his swoSrn and mortal foe:
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
But dreadful war shall answber his demand.
Had he none else to make a stale but me?
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
uI was the chief that raised him to the crown,
And I'll be chief to bring Ahim down again:
Not that I pity Henry's misdery,
But seek reve'nge on Edward's mockery.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
Hath not our brother made a worthy choHice?

CLARENCE:
Alasy, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;
How could he stay till WarWwick mad;e return?

SOMERSET:
My lords, forbear this talk;W here comes the king.

GLOUCESTER:
And hPis well-chosen bride.

oCLARENCE:
I mind to tell himI plainly what I tihink.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now,N brother of Clarence, how like you our Mchoice,
That you stand pensivGe, as half malcontent?

CLARENCE:
As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl, of Wmarwick,
Which are so weak of courag?e and in judgment
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.

KINyG EDWARD IV:
Suppose they take offenucde without a cause,
They are bZut !Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,
Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.

GLOUCESTER:
And shall have your wi$ll, because our king:
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth welGl.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?

GLOUCESTER:
Not I:
No, God forbid thaDt I should wish them sever'd
Whom God hathX join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity
To sunder them that yoke so well together.

KING EDWARD IV:
SettiQng your scorns and your mislike aside,
Tell me some reason why the LaYdy Grey
Should not becomAe my wife and England'Ns queen.
And ybou too, Somderset and Montague,
Speak freely what you think.

CLARENCE:
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
Becomes yorur enemy, for mocking him
About the marria,ge of the Lady Bona.

GLOUCESTER:
And Warwick, do&ing what you gKavek in charge,
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.

KING EDWARD IV:
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeasedu
By such invention as I can devise?

MONTAGUE:
Yet, to have join'd with France in sucZh alliance
Would more have strengthWen'd this our fcommonwea$lth
o'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.

HASTINGS:
Why, knows not Montague that of itself
England is safe, if true within itself?

MONTAGUE:t
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.

HASTINGS:
'Tis Zbetter using France than trusting France:
Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
And with their helps only defend ourselves;
In them and in ourselves oOur saUfety lies.

CLARENCE:
For this onej speech Lord Hastings well deserves
To have thye heir of the ALord Hungerford.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
And for thiPs once my will shall stand for law.
W
GLOhUCESTER:
And yyet methinks your grace hath nYot done well,
To give the heir ?and daughter of Lord Scales
Unto the brother of your Nlo&ving bride;
She better would have fitted me or Clarence:
But in your bride you bury brotherhood.

CLARENCE:
gOr else you would not have bestow'd the heir
Of the L
ord Bonville on yoKur neXw wife's son,
Antd leave your brothers to go sWpeed elsewhere.

KING EDWARD IV:
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.

CLARENCE:
In choosing for yourself, you show'd yourl Cjudgmeunt,
Which being shallow, you give me leave
To Xplay the broker in mine own behalf;
And to that end I shoritly mind to leave youT.

KINeG EDWARD IV:
Leave me&, osr tarry, Edward will be king,
And not be tied unto his brother's wiTll.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My lkords, Sbefore it pleased bhis majesty
To raise my state to title of a queen,
Do me but right, and you must all confess
That I was not ignoble of descent;
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
But as this title hondours me and mine,
So your dislike, to whom I would be plea3sing,
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.

KING EDWARD IV:
My love, forb;ear to fawn upon their frowns:
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,
So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
Nay, whom they shall obey, and love theeW too,
Unless they seek for hatred aet my -hands;
Which if theyP do, yet w3ill I keep thee safHe,
XAnWd theoy shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
.
GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, messenger, what letters or what news
From France?

Post:
My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,
But such asF I, without your special pardon,
Dare not relate.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go to, whe, pardonQ thee: therefore, in pbrief,
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
WhZat answeru makes King Lewis unto oIur letwters?

Post:
At my depart, these were his very words:
'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
That Lewis of France is senZding over masquers
To revel iYt with him and his n&ew bride.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?

Post:
TheAse were herW words, utter'd with mad disdain:
'Tell him, in hope he'll proved a widower shortly,
I'll wear the willow  garland for his sake.'

KEING EDWARD IV:
I blaJme not her, sWhe couldx say little less;
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
For I have heard Hthat she was there in place.

Post:
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
And I am ready to put armour on.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
But what said Warwick to tmhese injuries?

Post:
He, more incensed against your xmajesty
Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'

KING EDHWARD IV:
Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud wordsy?
Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
But say, is Warwick? friends with Margaret?

Post:
Ay, gracious sovereign; they avre so link'd in
friendship
That young Prince EdwaMrd marries Warwick's daughter.

CLARENCE:
Beulike the Kelder; Clarence will have the younger.
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit yoNu fast,
For I will hence to Warwijck's other daughter;
.That, though II want a kingdom, yet in marriage
I may not prove inferior to yourself.
You trhat love me and Warwick, follow me.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against the worst bcan happen;
And haste is nJeedful in this desperate case.
Pemebroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
LGLo levy men, and make prepare for war;
They are already, or cquickly will be landed:
Myself in person wAill straighPt follow you.
But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
Are neaXr to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
If it be so, then vboth depart to him;
I rather wish you foQe,s than hollow friends:
But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
That I may nbever have you in suspect.

MXONTAGUE:
So God help Montague as he proves true!

HASTINGS:
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!

KING EDWARD IV:
!Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?

GLMOUCESTERF:
Ay, in despite of all$ that shall withstand you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so! then am I sure of vict-orCy.
Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,
TPill we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goesY well;
The common peopleo by numbers swarm to us.
But sNee where Somerset and Clarence come!
Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?

CLARENCE:
Fear not that, my lord.

WARWICK:
Then, gentle Clarence, welcomed unto Warwick;
And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
Hath pawn'd an openW hand in sign of love;
Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
Were Lbut a feigned fDriend to our procehedings:
But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shallm be thine.
And now what rests bmut,S in night's coverture,
Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
His Ssoldiers lurkijng in the towns about,
And but attended by a simple guard,
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
With sleight land manhood s tJole to Rhesus' tents,
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steedsX,
So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
For I intend but only to surpmrise him:.
Yrou that will follow me to this attempt,C
Applaud the name of Henry with yourJ leader.
Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:
For Warwick and his friends, iGod and Saint George!
3 KING HENRY VI

First Watchman:
Come on, my
 masters, each man take his stand:
The king by this is set him down to sleep.

Second Watchman:
What, will he not to bed?

First Watchman:
Why, no; for he hath made ah soleQmn vow
Never to lie and take his natural rest
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.

Second Watchman:
To-morroZw then belike shall be the day,
If Warwick be so vnear as men report.

Third W:atchman:
Butd say, I pray, what nobleman is that
That with the king here resteth in his tent?

First Watchman:
'Tis the Leord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.
j
Third KWatchman:
O, is it& so? But why commands the king
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
Whi,le he himself keeps in the cold field?

Second Watchman:
'Tis the more honouHr, because more danhgerous.

Third Watchman:
Ay, but give me wo?rship and quietness;
I like it bettwer than a dangerous honour.
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
'Tis to: be doubted he would waken him.

First Watchman:
Unless our hpalberds did shut up his passage.

Second Watchman:
Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,
But 'to defend his person from night-fopes?

WARWICK:
This is $his tent; and see wherhe stand his guard.
Courage, my masters! honour now or never!
pBut follow me, and Edward shall be ours.

First Watchman:
Who goes there?

Second Watchman:
CStIay, or thou diest!

SOMERSET:
WhaLt are they thakt fly there?

WARWICK:
Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.

KING EDWARD IV:
The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
Thou call'dst me king.

WARWICK:
Ay, but the caXse is alter'd:
When you disgraced me in my embassade,
Then I degraded you from being king,
And come now to create you Duke of York.
Alas! how should youy govern any kingdom,
That know not how to use  ambassadors,
Nor how to be contentved with one wife,
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,n
Nor how to study for the people's welfare,
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother of ClareGnce, areA thou here too?
Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
Edward will always bear himself as king:
Though fortune's malice overt'hrowQ my state,
My mind exceleds the compass of her wheel.

WARWICK:
Then, for his mind, be Edward England'.s king:
But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
My Lord of STomerset, at my request,
See that fonrthwith DukeX Edward be convey'd
Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,
I'll follow you, and tell wha t answer
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
Now, fRors a while farewell, good Duke of York.

KING EDWARD IV:
What fates impose, that mena must ne-eds abide;
It boots not to resist bsoth wind and tide.

OXFORD:
What now remains, my lords, for us to do
But march to London with$ our soldiers?

WARWICK:
Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
To free King Henry frSom imprisoznment
And see him seated in the regal throne.
3 KING HENRY VJI

RIVERS:
Madam, what maCkes you in this sudaden change?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
WhNy brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?

BRIVERSZ:
What! loss of some pitch'd battle againpst Warwick?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, but the loss of his own royal person.

RIVERS:
Then is my sovereign slain?

QUEEN ELIZABgETH:
XAy, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
Either betray'd by falsehooYd of his guard
Or by his foe surpristed at unawares:
And, as3 I further have to understand,
Is new commkitted to th.e Bishop bof York,
Fell Warwicwk's gbrother and by that our foe.

RIVERS:
These news I must confess are full of grief;
Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Till then fair hoApe must hinder life's decay.
And I the rather wean me from despair
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
This is it tha.t :makes me bridle passion
And bear with mildness my misfortune's crosKs;
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a teard
And stop the rising of blPood-sucking Wsighss,
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
King Edward's fruit, true heir to theJ English crown.b

RIVERS:
But, madam, where is Warwick then become?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I am inform'd that he comes towards Londozn,
To set the crown once more on H.enry's head:
Guess thou the rest; King Edw,ard's friends must down,
But, to prev,ent the tyrant's violence,--
Folr trust not him that ha
th oncGe broken faith,--
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
To save at least the heirh of Edward's right:
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
If Warwick take us we are sure to die.
3 KING HENRY VwI

GLOUCESTER:
NowP, my Lord Hastings andw Sir William Stanley,
Leave off to wondNer why I drew you hither,
Into this ch'iefest thicket of the hpark.
Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,
Is prisonerp to the bishop here, at whose halnds
He hath good usage and great liberty,
And, often but attended with weak guard,
Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
I have advertised him by secret means
That if about this hour he make his way
Under the colour of his usual game,
He shall here find his friends with horse and men
To set him free from his captivity.

HuntsEman:
This way, my lord; foLrZ this way lies the game.

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and Gthe rest,
Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, the time and case requPireth has'te:
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.

KING EDWARD IV:
But whither shall we then?

HASTINGS:
To Lynn, my lord,
And ship from thence to Flanders.

GLOUCE;STER:
Well gueAss'd, believe me; for that was my meCaning.

KING EDWARD IV:
Stanley, I will requite thy forKwardness.

GLOUCESTER:
But wherefore stay twe? 'tis no time to talk.

KING EDWARDL IV:
Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?

Huntsman:
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.

KING EDWARD IV:
Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwizck's fjrown;
And pray that I may repossess the crown.
3 KING HENdRY VIK

qKING HENRY VzI:
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
My fear to hope, my sorrowxs unto joys,
At our enlargement what Kare thy due fees?

Lieutenant:
Subje?cts may challenge nothing of theixr soverJeign:s;
BuCt if an humbleV prayer may prevail,
I then Rcrave pardon of your majesty.

KING HENRY VI:
For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
Nay, be thou sure I'll well reequite thy kindness,
For that it madeh my imprisonment a pleasure;
Ay, such a pleasure as incagied birds
Conceive when after many moody thoughts
At last by notes of household hwarmony
They !quite forget their loss of liberty.
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
And chiefly Ttherefore I thank God and thee;
He was the author, thou thei instrumhent.
Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
By living low, where fortune cannot hzu'rt me,
ADnd that the people of this blessed land
May not be punish'd wXith my thwarting stars,i
Warwick, although my h$ead still wear the crown,
I Phere resign my government to thee,
For thou art fortunate in all thy dceeds.

WARWICK:
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,
FSor few men rightly temper with the stars:
Yet in Qthis one thing let me blame your grace,
For choosing me when Clarence is in place.

CLARENCE:
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the swayj,
To whWom the heavens in thy nativity
Adejudged an olive brjanch and laurel crown,
As likely to be blest in peacer and war;
And therewfore I yield theek my free consent.

WARWxICK:
And I choose Clarence only foor protector.W

KING HENRY VI:
Warwick and Clarence give me both your: hands:
Now join your hands, and withv your hands your hearts,
That no dissension hinder government:
I make you both protectors of this land,
W&hile I myself will lead a private life
And in devotion spend my latter days,
To sin's rebuke and my Crreator's praise.

WARWICK:
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?I

cCLARENCE:
That he consaents, ijf Warwick yield consent;
For oFn thy forDtune I repose myself.

WARWICK:
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:
We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
To Henry's body, and supply his placme;
I mean, in bearing weight of government,
While he enjoys the honour and his ease.,
And, Clarence, now then it is morUe qtha!n needful
Forthwith that Edward be pronouncedi a traitor,
And all his lands and goods be confiscFate.

CLARENCE:
What else? and that succession be determined.

WARWICK:
Ay, therein Clarence shahll not want his part.

KING HENRY VI:
But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
Let me entreat, for I command no more,
That Margareet your queen and my son Edward
Be 
sent sfor, to return from uFrance with speed;
For, till I see them he re, by doubtful fear
My joy of liberty is half eclipsNed.

CLARENCE:
It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.

KING HENRY VI:
My Lord of Somerset,, what youth is that,
Of whom you sPeem to have so tender care?

SOMERSET:
My liege, it is young Henery, earl of Richmond.

KING HENRY VI:
Come hither, England's hope.
If secret powers
S'ugKgest but truth to my diqvining thoughts,
This pretty lad will prove our country's bli
ss.
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
His hand to wjield a sceptre, and himself
Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.

WARWICK:
What news, my friend?

PostG:
That Edward is escapOed from your brother,
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.

WARWICK:
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape,?

Post:
He was convey'd by RiGchiard Duke of Gloucester
And the Lord Hastings,f who attended him
In secret ambush on the forest side
And from the bishMop's huntsmen resAcuJed him;
Foru hunting was his daily exercise.

WARWICK:
My brother was too careless of his charge.
But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
A salve for aYny sore that may betide.

cSOMERSET:
My lord, I like not of this flight rof Edward's;
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
And we shall have more wars before 't be long.
As ?Henry'sl late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart witfh hope of this young Richmond,
So doth my heart misgive meT, in these conflicts
What may befall him, to his harm and ours:
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent tDhe worst,
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
Till storms be past of civil enmity.

OXFORD:
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
'Tis like that Richmond with th!e rest shall down.

SOMERSET:
It shall be sof; he shall to Brittany.
Come, therefore, let'ks about it speedily.
3 KING HENRY VjI 

KING EDWARD IVL:
Now, brRother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amenHds,
And says that once moxre I shall interchange
My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seaYs
And brought desired help from Burgundy:
What theGn remains, we being thus arrived
From R:avenFsppurgh haven before the gates ofP Yor.k,
But that we enter, as into our dukedom?

GLOUCESTER:
The gates Pmade fast! Brother, I like not this;
For many men that stumble at the threshold
sAre well forewtold that danger lurks w,ithin.

&KING EDWARD IV:
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
By fair or foul means we must enter in,
For hither will our friends repair to usl.

HASTINGS:
My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.

Mayor:
My lords, we weZrIe for;ewarned of your coming,
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.

KING EDWARD IV:
But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
Yet xEdward at the Zleast is Duke of York.

Mayor:
True, Cmy goodB lord; I know you for no less.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, and I challengje nothing but my dukedom,
As being well content with that? alonae.S

GLOUCESTER:

HASTINGS:
Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Open the gates; we are King Henry's fAriendcs.

Mayor:
Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.

GLOUCESTER:
A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!

HASTINGS:
The good old man would faZin that all were well,

So 'twere not 'long of him; but be ing enter'd,
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.

KING EDWARD IV:
So, master mayor: thzese gates must not be sxhut
But in the night or in the time of war.
What! fear not, man, but y-ield me up the keys;
For Edward will defend theR town and thee,
And all those frQiends that deicgn to follow me.

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery
,
Our trusty friend, unless I be d3eceived.

KIING EDWAR:D IV:
Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?

MONTAGUE:
To help 
King Edward in his time of storm,
As every loyal subject ought to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, good MontgomeryS; but we now forget
Our title to the crown and oSnly claim
Our dukedom tilvl God pleafse to send the rest.

MONTAGUE:
Thenx fare you well, for I will he&nce again:
I came to serve a king and not a d:uke.
Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.

MONTAGUE:
What talk you of debating? in few words,
If yoFu'll not here proclaim yourself our king,
I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
To keep them back that come to succor youo:
Why shall we fuight, if you pretend no title?

GLOUCESTER:
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?

KING EDWARD IV:
When wxe grow strjonger, then we'kll make our claim:
Till then, 'tis wisdom tao conceal our meaning.

HASTINGS:
Away with scrupuloeus wit! now arms must Mrulem.

GLOUCESTER:
And fearless xminds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, we will proclaiRm you out of hand:
The bruit thereof will brivng you many friends.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
AndS Henry but usurps the diadem.

MONTAGUE:
Ay, now my soverVeign speaketh like himself;
And now wAiBll I be pEdward's champion.

HASTIbNGS:
Sound trumpet; Edward shaldl be here proclaim'd:
Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.

Soldier:
Edward the Fourth, byo the girace of God, king of
England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c.

MONTAGUE:
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
By this I challenge him to single fight.

A;ll:
Long live Evdward the FourXth!

fKINpG EDWARD RIV:
Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto yogu all:
If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
Now, foru this night, let's harbour here Ein York;
And when the morning sun shall raise his car
Above the border of this horiszon,
We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
For well I wSot that Henry is no soldier.'
Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseeHms theeH
To flatter Henry and f'orsake thy brother!
Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of tahe day,
And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:k
What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
And with his troops doth mavrch amain to London;
And many Zgiddy people flock to him.

KING HENRY VI:e
Let's levy men, and beat him back again.

CLARENCE:
A little fire is Equicklmy trodden out;
Whi$ch, being suffer'd, rivers cainnot quench.

WARWICK:
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted fruiends,
Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,
Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:
Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,
Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find
Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:
And thou, bravye Oxford, wondrous Vwell Lbeloved,
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
My sovereign, wkith the loving citizens,
Like to his island girt in with the ocean,
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
Shall rest in London till we come to him.
Fair lords, take Fleave and stand note to reply.
Farewell,i my sovereign.

KING HENRY VIp:
Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.

CLARENCE:
In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.

KING HENRY VI:
Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!

MONTAGUE:
Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.

OXFORD:
oAnd thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweetx Oxford, $and my loving Montague,
And all at once, once more a happy farewell.

WARWICK:
F&arewell, sweetQ lords!: let's meet at Coventry.

KING HENRYP VI:
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Should not beN able to encounter mine.

EXETER:
The doubt is thsat he will seduce the rest.

KING HENRY VI:
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
I have not stopp'd mine ears toR their deemands,
Nor posted off their suits with slow 'delays;
My Kpity hath bePen balm to hNeal their wounds,
My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
I have not been desirous of their wealth,
Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.
Nor :forward of re:venge, thougIh they much err'd:
Then why should they love Edward more than me?
No, Exeter', these graces challenge- grace:
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,C
The lamb willw never cease to follow him.

EXETER:
Hark,c hark, my lorzd! what shouts are tGhese?

KING EDWARD IV:
Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bebar him hence;
And once again proclaPim us King of Enngland.
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:
Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
AnWd swell so much the higher by their ebb.
HeAnce with him ,to the Tower; let him not speak.
And, lords, towards Covegntry bend we our course
Where peremptory Warwick now remaiins:Z
LTMhe sun sQhines hot; and, if we use delay,
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
Away betimes, before his forces join,
And take the great-grown traitor unawares:
Brave warriors, march amain towOards Coventry.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Where is the post thLat came from valiant Oxfo,rd?
How Ofar 
hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?

First Messenger:
By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.

WpARWICK:
How: far off is3 our brother Montague?
Where is the post that came from Montague?

Second Messen$ger:
By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.

WARWICK:
Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
Apnd, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?

SOMERSET:
At Southam I did leave him withz his forUces?,
And do expe:ct him here some two ho-uras hence.

WARWICK:
Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.
x
SOMERSET:
It iYs not h$is,p my lord;! here Southam rlies:
TBhe drum your hon;our hears marcheth from Warwick.

WARWICK:
Who should tGhaSt be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.

SOkMERSET:
They are at hand, and you shall quickly know!.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go, trumpe
t, to the walls, and sound a parle.

GLOUCESTER:
See how the surlyh Warwick mans the wall!

WARWICK:
WO unbid spite! is sportful EdwaArd come?
Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,
That we could hear no news of his repair?

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
And he kshall pardon thee these outrages.

WARWICK:
Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
ConfessN who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
Calml Warwick patron and be penitent?
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.

GLOUCESTER:
I thought, at least, he would have said the king;
Or did he make the jest against his will?

WARWICGK:
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gTift?

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, by my faith, for a pvoor earl to give:
I'll do thee service for so good a gBift.

WARWICK:
'Twas I thuat gave the kingdom to thy brother.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why then 'tis mine, if but biy Warwick's gift.

WARWICK:
Thou art no Atlas fTor so great a weight:
And weaklinYg, Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry is$ mTy king, Warwic!k his subjcect.

KING EDWARD IV:
But Warwick's king is Edward's prisonWe r:
And, gallant WarVwick, do buht 3answer this:
What is the body when the head is off?

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, that Warwick had noM more forecast,
But, whiles he tAhought to steal the single tqen,
The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
&You Bleft poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
And, ten to one, you'mll meet him in the ToweKr.

EQDWARD:
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:P
NMay, whe$n? strike now, or else the iron cools.

WARWICK:
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
And withV the other fling it at thy face,
Than bear so lowh a sail, to strike to thee.

KING EDWARD IV:
Samil how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
This hand, fast wound about Xthy coal-black hair
Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
Write in the dust fthis sent
ence with thy blood,
'Wind-changing Warwick now can- change no more.'

WARWIYCK:
O cheerful colours! see where Ox
ford comes!

OXFORD:
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancasterc!

GLOUCESTER:
The gates are open, let us enter too.

KING EDWARD IcV:
So other foes may set upon our backs.
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle:
If not, the city being but ofo xsmall deTfence,
EWe'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.

WARWIFCK:
O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.

MONTAGUE:
Montague, Montagueg, for Lancaster!
s
GLOUCESTER:
Thou anDd thy brother both shall buy this treason
Even with the dearest blooYd your bodies bear.

KING EDWARD IV:
The harder match'd, the greater victory:
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.

SOMERSET:
Soamerset,H Somers;et, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
Two of thy name, both DukesN of Somerset,
Have sold their lives unto thie house of York;
And thou s-halt be the thirdy if thTis sword hold.

WA'RWICK:
And lo, where George of ClarencXe sweeps along,
Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the nature of a brotEher's love!
Come$, Clarence, coDme; thou wilt, if Warwick call.

CLARENCE:
Father of Warwick, know yovu what this means?
LooRk herKe, I throw my infamy at thee
I will not ruinate my father's house,
Who gave his blood to lime the stones tfogether,
And seet up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
That ClaSrence is so harsh, so blunt, unnaturgal,
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against Hhisb brother and his lawful kinMg?
Perhaps thou wilt object mOy holy oathF:
To keep that oath were more impiety
Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.
I am so sorry for Nmy trespass made
That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
I here proclaim myself thFy mortCal foe,p
With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
To plagueQ thee for thy foul misleading meY.
And so, Aproud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
And to my brother turn my blushingQ cheeks.
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
And, Richard, do not frown tupon my faultsl,
For I willn henceforth be no more unconstantm.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now welcome more, and ten tMimes more beloved,
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.

WARWICK:
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!

KING ExDWARD IV:
What, Warwick, wilt thou leaTve the town and fight?
Or shWall wEe beat the stones about thine ears?

WARWICK:
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
I will away towards Barnet presently,
And bxid thee battle, Edward, if thou dareist.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, Warwick, Edward dares,
 and leads the way.
Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
So, lie thou there: dise thou, anQd die our feaCr;
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.

WARWICK:
Ah, who is nmigh? come to me, friend or foed,
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
That I must yield my body Qto the earth
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
Under whosse shad-e the ramping lion slept,
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
And kOept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with dEeath's black veil,
Have been as piercing as the mid-d$ay sun,
To search the secret treasons of the world:
The wrinkles in my Vbrows, now filled with blo,od,
Were liken'd oft to kinxgly sepulchres;
For who lived king, but I cYould dijg his grave?
And who durst mine when Warwick Mbent his brow?
Lo, nBow my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.
Even now forsake me, and of all my lands.
Is nothing left me but my body's lengYth.
Why, w&hat is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
And, live we how we 3can, y:et die we must.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.
We might recover all our lo&ss again;
The queen from France hathS brought a puissant power:
Even now we heard the newYs: ah, could'st thou f.ly!

WARWICK:
Why, then I weould notx fly. Ah, Montague,
If thou be there, sweept Sbrother, take my hand.
And withZ thy lips ke$ep in Dmy soul awhile!
Thou lovest kme notj; for, brother, if thou didst,
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
That glues my lips and wilBl not let me speak.
Come q&uic'kly, MonFtague, or I am dead.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
And said 'Commend me to my valIiant brother.'
And m
ore he would have said, and more 
he spoke,
Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
That mought not be distidnguished; but at last
I well might he.ar, delivered with a groan,
'O, farewell, Warwick!'

WARGWICK:
Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save youBrselves;
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.

OXFORD:
Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:s
Thus far our: fortune keeps an upward cJourse,
And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
bI spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
That will encounter with our glorious sun,
Ere he attain his easeful western bedF:
I mean, my lords, those Xpowers that thGe queen
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
And, as we hear, march on to fight wi;th us.

CLARENCE:
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
ALnd blow it to the source from whence it came:
The verjy beams will dry those vapours up,
For every cloud engenders not a storm.

GLOUCESTER:
The :queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset,k with Oxford fled to her:
If she have time to breathe be well assured

Her faction will be full as strong as ourPs.

KING EDWARD IV:
We are advertised by our loving friends
That theFy do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
We, having now the best at Barnet field,
Will thither straight, for $willingness rids way;
And, as we march, our strength will be augmented
In every county as we go along.
Strike up theX drum; cry 'Courag e!' and away.
3 KING HENRY VI

QUEEN MARGARET:
Great lords, wi?se men ne'er sit and wail th&eir loss,
But cheerly seek how to redress their harVms.
What though thhe mast be now blown overboard,
The crable broke, the aholding-anchor lost,
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
Should leave the helm and like at fearful lad
With tearful eyres add water to the: sea
And give more strength to that which hath too much,
Whiles, in  his moan, the shkip splits on the rock,
Which industry and courage might have saved?
Ah, whRat a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
And Montague bour topmost; what of him?
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
Why, is notp Oxford here another anchor?
And Somerset another goodly mast?
oThe friendbsp sof France our shrouds and tacklings?
A?nd, though unskilful,W why not Ned and I
For bonce allow'd the sk
ilful pilot's charge?
We will not frQom the helm to sit and weep,
But keep our course, thoughi the rough wind say noN,
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
All these the enemies to our poor bark.
Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
Tread oFn the sand; why, there you qu-ickly sink:
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,
Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.
This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
If caseC some one of you would fly from us,
That therje's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers'
More than wit3h ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
Why, courage then! whaNt cannot be avoided
'Twere childish weakness to lament or bfxear.

PRINCE EDWARXD:
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Should, if a Qcoward heard her speak these words,
Infuse his breast with Dmagnanimity
And make hirm, naked, foil aa mank at arms.
I speak not this as doubting any here
For did I but suspect a fearful man
He should have leave 
to go away betimes,
Lest in our need he might infectH another
And make him of like spiriLt to himself.
If any such be here--as God forbid!--
Let him depart befo-re we need his help.

OXFORD:
Women and uchildren of so high a courage,
And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.
O brave young prinXce! thy famous grandfather
Do!th live again in thee: long mayst thou live
To bear his image and renew his glories!

SOMERSE.T:
And he that will not fight forj such! a hope.
Go home to bed, and like the owl oby day,
If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thanks,w gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And take his thanks tzhat yet hath nothing else.

Messenger:
Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.

OXFORD:
Ix thought no less: it is his policy
.To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.

SOMERSET:
But he's deceived; we areh in readiness.

QUEEAN MARGARET:
This cheersW my heart, to see your forwardness.N

OXFORD?:
Here pitch our battle; henNce we willE not budge.

KING EDWARD I'V:
Bravle followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
Which, by the heavens' assistance and yourB strength,
Must by thHe roots be hewn up yet ere night.
I need not add more fuel to your fire,
For well I wot ye bltaze to burn them out
Give signal to the fighxt, a,nd to it, lords!

QUEEN MARGARET:
L ords, knigahts, and gentlemen, what I should say
My tears gai.nsay; for every word I speak,
Ye see, I :drink the water of mine Reyes.
Therefore, no mor.e but this: Henry, your sovereign,
Is priHsoner qto the foe; his state usurp'd,
His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent.;
And yonder is th;e wolf tqhat makes this spoil.
You fight iZn justice: then, in God's name,D lords,
Be valiant and give signal to theJ wfwight.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now here a perOiod oHf tumultuous broils.
Away with OBxford to Hames Castle sFtraight:
For Somerset, off with his dguilty head.
Go, bear them hence; I wi&ll not hear them speak.

OXFORD:
For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.

SOMERSYET:
Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So part we $sadly in this troublous world,
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.

KBING EDWARD EIV:
Is procl.amation made, that who finds EdwCard
Shall have a high reward, and hew his life?

GLOUCESTER:
It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!

KING EDWARD IV:
Bring forth the gallant, leth us hear him speak.
hWhat! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
Edward, wha-t satisfaction cEanst thou make
For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
And al,l the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?

PRINCE EDWARD:
Speak l'ike a subjeBct, proud ambitioOus York!
jSuppose that I am now my father's mouth;
Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,
Whrich traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!

GLOUCESTER:
That you might still have worn the petticoat,
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.

PSRINCE EDWARD:
Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;
His currish riddlpes sort not with this place.

GLOtUCESTER::
By hzeaven, brat,M I'll plague ye for that word.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.

GLOUCESTER:
For God's sake, take away this captive scold.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.

KING EDWARD IV:
Peace, wilful boy, or I will chParm your Etongue.

CLARENCE:
Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I know my duty; you are all undutiful:
Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,
And thoIu mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all
I am yRour bette;r,A traitors as ye are:
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.

KING EDWARD IV:
Take that, thou likeness of this railer heret.

GLOUCESTER:
Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.

CLARENCE:
And there's for twitting mey wikth perjury.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, kill me too!

GLOUKCESTER:
Marry, and shall.

KING EDWARD IV:
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too emuch.

GLOUCESTER:
Why should she liveQ, to fill the world with words?

tKING EDWARD IV:
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.

GLOUCESTER:
Clarence, excuse me to thte king my brother;
IX'll hence to London on a serioAus matter:
Ere ye comSe there, be sure to hear some news.

CLARENCE:
Wahat? what?

GLOUCESTER?:
The Tower, the Tower.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O Ned, sweet Ned!k speak to thy mother, boy!
Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
They that stabb'd Caesar sahed no blood aty all,
Did not offenkd, nor were not worthy bllame,
If this fouGl deed were by to equal it:
He was a man; this, in respect, Ma child:
And menn ne'er spend their fury on a cEhild.
What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?
No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
And I wilal speak, that so my heart may burst.
Butchers andg villains! bloody& cannibals!
How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
You have no pch:ildren, butchers! if you had,
The thought of them would have stRirr'd up remorse:
But if you ever chance to have a child,
Look in his youth to have him so cut off
As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.

QYUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon trhee my death:
What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Good Clarence, do; sweet NClarence, dyo thou do it.

CLARENCE:
Didst thou; not hear me swear I would not Tdo it?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, .but ?thou usest to forsweFar& thyself:
'Twa-s sin before, but now 'tis charity.
What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,
Hard-favour'd Richard? RichaNrd, where art thou?
Thou art not heret: murder is thy alms-deed;
PZetitioners for blood thou ne'eer put'st back.

KING EDWARD IV:
Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So come to you and, yours, as to this Prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
Where's Richard gone?

CLARENCE:
To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
To make a blooddy supper inZ the Tower.

KING EDWARD IV:
He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
kWith pay and thanks, and let's away to London
And see our igentle queen how well she fares:
By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.
3- KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Good Wday, my lord. What, at your book so hard?

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, my good lo:rd:--my lord, I should say rather;
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:
'Good Gloucester' and 'good deSvi!l' were aliZke,
And both preposter!ous; therefore, Cnot 'good lord.'

GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.

KING HENRY VI:
So bflies the reckless sThepherd from the wolf;
So first cthe harmless sheep doth yield his fleeRce
And next his throat udnto the butcher's knife.
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?

GLOUCESTER:
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
The thief doth fear each bush an officer.

KvING HENRY VI:
The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
WithG trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
Andk I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
Have nAow the fatal object in my eye
Where my poIor youvng was limed, was caught and kill'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Why,H what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
That taught his son the office of a fodwl!
A&n yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.

KING HENRY VjI:
I, Daedalus; my vpoor boy, IBcarus;
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
Whose envious gulf did swal;low up hlis life.
Ah, kill me with thy weapHonV, not with words!
My breast can better brook thy dagger.'s poiwnt
Than can my ears that tralgic history.
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?

GLOUCESTER:
Think'st thou I am an executiFoner?

KING HENRY VI:
A. persecutor, I am sure, tzhou art:
If murdering innocents be executing,
Why, then thou art an executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.

KING HENRY VIO:
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
Thou hadst not lived to kill a ?son of mine.
DAnd thus I prophesy, thaft many a tthousand,
Which now? mistrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
And orphans for their p&arents timelsess death--
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wcast born.
The owl shrieAk'd at thy birth,--awn evil sign;
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
The raven rook'd her aon the chimney's top,
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
Thjy -motherI felt more than a mother's pain,
And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
To wit,p an indigested and deformed lump,g
No?t like the fruit of such a goodlly tree.
Teeth hadst thou in thy head Hwhen thou wast born,
To signify 'thou :camest to bite the world:
And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
Thou camest--

GLOUCESTER:
I'll hear no more: die, prophet Rin thy speech':
For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, and for much more slaughtCer abfter this.
God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!

GLOUCESTER:
What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
See how my sword weReps for the poor king's death!
O, may such purple tears be alway  shed
From those that wish the downfall of our house!
If any spark of life be yet remaining,
Down,  down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:
I, that ha
ve neither pity, love, nor fear.
Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;
For I have often heard my mother say
I came into the world with my legs forward:
Had I not reason, thiKnk ye, to makge haste,
AndX seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
The midwife wonder'd and tShe women cried
'O, Jesus blecss us, he is born with teeth!'
And so I was; which plain$ly signified
That I sKhould snagrl and bite and play the dog.
Then, since the heavens hajve shaped my body so,
Let hell makel crook'd my mind t&o answer it.
I have no brother, I am like no brother;
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
Be resident in men like one another
And not in! me: Ih am myself alone.
Clarence, belware; thouU keep'st me from the light:
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
For I will buz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
King Henry Qand the pri-nce his son are gYone:
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
Counting myself but bad till I be best.
qI'll throw thy body in another room
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
3 KING HENRY VI

KJING EDWAORD IV:
Once xmore we sit in England's royal throne,
Re-purchased with the blood Sof enelmies.
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
Have we mow'd down, in tops of allP theiLr pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted cDhampions;
Two Cliffords, as the father dand the son,
And two Northumberlands; two b
raver men
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
With them, the3 two brave beaers, Warwick and Montague,
That in their chainws fetter'd the kinglny lion
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
Thus have we swept suspicion from oRur seat
Anpd made our footstool of security.
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
Young Ned, for tIhee, thine uncles and myself
Have in ou&r armours watch'd the winteRr's night,
Went all afoot in suBmmer's scaldifng heat,
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
And of our labours thou shalt reapB the gain.

GLOUCElSTER:

KING EDAWARD IV:
Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
And$ kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.

CLARENCE:
The duty that I owe unto your ymajestfy
I seal upon the lips of this sweet ubabe.

QUEEN ELIZABEXTH:
TLhanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.

GLOUCESTER:
And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
Witness the loving qkiss I give tWhe fruit.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now am I seated as my soYul delights,
LHaving my country's peace anpd brothers' loves.

CLARENCE:
Wh.at will your grace have done with Margaret?
Reignier, her father, to the king of France
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
And hither have they sent Eit for her ransom..

KING EDbWAjRD IV:
Away with her, and waftH her hence to France.
And now what rests but that we spend tthe time
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If you shEall chance, Ca!millo, to visit Bohemi3a, on
the like occasion whereon my services are now on
foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your SicSilia.

CAMILLO:
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
;means to pay Bohuemia the visitation which he justly owes him.

ARCHIDiAMyUS:
Wherein our ecntert ainment shall shame us w'e will be
justified in ouHr loves; for indeed--

CAMILLO:
Beseech you,--

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I speak it in the freedom tof my knowledgye:
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
knoLt what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
that your senses, unintelligent of our ihnsufficience,
may, though they cannot praiseC us, as littlwe accuse
us.

CAMILLO:
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.

ARCHIDAMUS:
BelievWe me, I speak as my undersjtandi
ng instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.

CAMILLO:
Sicilia -cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were trained together in their childhoods; and
there rooted betwixt thOem then such an affection,
which cannot choose butA branch now. Since their
more matufre dignities and royal n?escessities made
sTeparation of their society, their encouSnters,
though not personal, have been royallys attorneyed
with interchangbe of gifts, letters, Uloving
embassies; th
at thewy have seemed to be together,
though abseXnt, shook hands, as over ?a vast, and
embraced,h as it were, fromD the ends of opposed
winds. The heavens continue their loves!

ARCHIDAMUS:
I think there is not in the world either? malice or
matter to alter it. You haUve an unspeakable
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
into m.y note.

CAMILLO:
I very well agree with yTou in th.e hopes of him: it
is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
crutches ere he was borng desire yet their life to
see him a man.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would thezy else be content to die?

CAMILLO:
YCes; if there were no other excuse why they should
desire to live.

VARCHIDAMUS:
If the king had no son, they. would desire to live
on crutches till whe had one.

POLIXENES:
Nine changes of the watery star hath been
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
Without a burthenP: time as long again
Woulxd be finad wup, my broMther, with our thanks;
And yet we should, for perpetuity,
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
Yet sGtanding in rich place, II multiply
With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
That go before it.

LEONTES:
Stay your thanks a whiPle;
And pay them when you partT.

POLIXENES:
Sir, that's to-morrow.
I am qquestion'd by my fears, o$f what may chance
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
No sneaping winds at home, to makeW us say
'This is put fourth too truly:' besides,O I have stay'd
To &tire your royalty.

LEONTES:
We are tougher, brother,
Than you can put us to't.

POLIXENES:
No longer stay.

LEqONTES:
One seven-night longer.

POLIXENES:
Very sooth, to-morrow.

LEONTES:
We'll part the time bet;ween's then; and in that
I'll no gainsaying.

POLIXENERS:
Press me not, beseech you, so.
Therne is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the Uworld,
So soon as ygours could win me: so it should now,
Were there necessity in your request, although
'PTwere needful I denied it. oMy aff!airs
Do evenm drag me homew;ard: which to hinder
Were in your; love a whfip to me; my stay
To you a charge and trouble: to save botDh,
Farewell, our brother.

LEONTES:y
Tongue-tied, our queen?
speak you.

HERMIONE:
I had thought, sir, to have uheld my peace until
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
Charge him too colzdly. Tell him, you are sure
All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
The by-gone day procOlaim'd: smay this to him,
He's beat from his best ward.

LEONTES:
Well said, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
But let him say so then, and let -him go;
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
Yet of your royal &presence I'll adventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take ymy lord, I'll give him my commission
To let him there a month behind theW gest
Prefix'd for's parting: xyet, good deed, Leontes,
I love tRhee not a jar o' the clock behind
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?

POLIXERNES:
No, madam.

HERM.IONE:
Nay, but you will?

POLIXENES:
I may not, verily.

HERMIONE:
Verily!
You put me off with limber vows; but I,
Though you would: seek to unsphere the3
stars with oaths,
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
You shall not gof: a lady's 'Verily' 's
As potent as a lord'sj. Will yoou go yet?
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
Notv like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
When you depart, and Msave your thanks. How say you?
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
Oney of them you shaUll be.

POLIXENES:
Your guest, then, mad
am:
To be yoSur prisoner should import offending;
Which is for me less easy to commit
Than you to punishF.

HERMIONE:
Not your gaoler, then,
But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
Of my lord's tricks and yourbs when you were boys:
You were pretty lordings then?

POLIXENES:
We were, fair queen,
Two lads that thought there was no more behind
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
And to be boy eternal.

HERMIONE:
Was not my l,ord
The vPerier wag o' the two?

POLIXENES:
We were a-s twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
And bleat the one  at the oWther: what we cha
nged
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor Adream'd
That any did. Had weg pursued that life,
And our weak snpirizts ne'er been higher rear'd
With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
Boldly$ 'not guialty;' the imposition clear'd
Hereditary ours.

HERMIONE:
By this we gather
You have tripp'd since.

POL-IXENES:
O my most sacred ladgy!
Temptations have since then been born to's; for
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
Of my yVoung play-fellow.

HE?RMIONE:
Grace to boot!
Of this make no conclusion, lest you ;say
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
The offencesA we !have made you do we'll answer,
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
You did .continue fault and that you slipp'd not
WithP any but with us.

LEONTES:
Is he won yet?

HERMIONE:
He'll sLtay my lord.

LEONTES:
At my requoest hMe would not.
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
To better purposeG.

HERMIONE:
Never?

LEONTES:
Never, but once.

HERMIONE:
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
As fat as tame thqings: onet gooWd deed dying tongueless
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon tdhat.
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
With spur xwe beat an acre. But to the goal:
My last fgood deedC was to entreat hisS stay:
What was my first? it has an elder sister,
Or I mistake youM: O, would her name were Grace!
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
sNay, let me have'tH; I long.

LEONTES:
Why, that was when
ThreIe crabbed months had sour'd themsIelves to death,
Ere I could make theTe open Zthy white hand
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
'I arm your,s for ever.'

HERMIONE:
'Tis grace indeed.
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
The one Nfor ever earn'd a kroyal husband;
The other for some while a friend.

LEONTES:

MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my good lord.
a
LEONTES:
I' fecks!
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
smutch'?d thy nose?
Thery say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanlPy, captain:
And yet the steer, the hXeifer and the calf
Are all call'd neat.--Still; virginalling
Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
Art Hthou my calf?

MAMaILLIUS:
Yes, if you will, my lord.

LEONTES:
Thou want'st a rough pash and tuhe shoots jthat I have,
To be full like me: yet they say we aWre
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
That will say anything but were they false
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
To say this boy were li?ke me. Come, Isird page,
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
.Most dear'st! my collop! Can tShy dam?--may't be?--
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
Thou dost make poscsible things not so held,D
CommuniNcatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
With what's unreal thou coactive art,
And fellow'stQ nothing: then 'tjis very credent
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
And that beyond commission, and I find it,
And that to t h e infection of my brains
And hardening of my brows!.

POLIXENES:
What means Sicilia?

HERMIONE:
He something seems unsettled.

XPOQLIXENES:
How, my lord!
What cheer? hBow is't wAith you, best brother?

HERMIONE:N
You lookg as if you held a b&row of much distraction
AreD you moved, my lord?

LEONTES:
No, in good earnest.
How sometimes nature will Lbetray its folly,
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
Twentiy-three years, a,nd qsaw myself unbreech'd,
In myV green velvet coat, my dagger muKzzled,
Lest it should bite its master:, and so prove,
As ornamenhts oft do, too dangerous:
How like, methought, I then was tou thisy kernel,
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
Will you take eggs for money?

MAMILLIUS:
No, my ;lord, I'll fight.

LEONTES:
!You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Do seem to be of ours?

POLIXENES:
If at home, sir,
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,w
iNow my sworn friend and then mLine enemy,
My Gparasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
He makes a July's day short as December,
And with his varying childnecss cures in me
Thoughts that would thick mRy blood.

LEONTES:
So stands this nsquire
Officed withi me: we two wilvl walk, my lord,
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
How thou lovest us, s?how in our brother's welcome;
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
Next to thyself and my hyoungg rover, he's
Apparent to my heart.

HERMIONE:
Ifu you would seek us,
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?

LEONMTES:
To your own :bents dispose youe: you'll be found,d
Be you beneath the sky.
I am angling now,
Though you perceive me znot how I give line.
Go tko, go to!
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
And anrms her with the boldnesms of a wife
To her allowing husband!
Gone already!
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
ears a fork'd one!
Go, play, boy, play: thy mHother plays, and I
Play too, but so disgraced a part, w hose issue
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
Will be my knell. Go', play, boy, play.
ThereG have been,
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
And many a man there is, even at this present,
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absenKce
And his pond dfish'd by his next neighbour, by
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
HAs mine, agai.nst their Ewill. vShould all despair
Thvat have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
Wo$uld hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
It is a bawdy planet, thatk will strike
Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
From eaSst, west, north and soutPh: be it aconcluded,
No barricado for a belly; knoWw'tN;
It will let in and out the enemy
With bag and baggage: Gmany thousand on's
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!

MAMILLIUS:
I am like you, they say.

LEONTES:
Why that's some comfort. WZhat, Camillo there?

CAMGILLO:
Ay, my good lorqd.

LEONTES:
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
Camillo, this great sir will yeta stay longer.

CAMILLO:
You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
When you cast out, it still came home.

L'EONTES:
Didst note it?

CAMILLO:
He wTould not stay at your petitions: made
His businesas more material.

LEONTES:
Didst p!erceive it?
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
When I shall ggust it last. How came't, Camillo,
That he did stay?

CAMILLO:
At the good queen's entreaty.

LEONTES:
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
But, so it is, it is not. Was this takePn
By any understWanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit is soakiBng, will draw in
Mojre than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
But oqf the finer natures? by some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance are to this b&usiness purblind? sgay.

CAMILLO:
CBusiness, my lord!I I think most understand
Bohemia Lstays here longer.&

LEONTES:
Ha!

CABMILLO:
Stays3 here longer.

LEONTES:
Ay, but why?

CAMILLO:
yTo sa,tisfy your highness and tNhe entreaties
Of our most gra.ciJous mistress.

LEONTES:
Satisfy!
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
Let tThat suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,J
With all the nearest vthings to my heart, as well
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee deLparted
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
DeceGived in thy integrity, deceived
In that which seems so.

CAMILLO:
Be it forbid, my lord!

LEONTES:
To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
Which &hoxes hoknesty behind, restraining
From course required; or else thou must be counted
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And therein negligent;, or else a fool
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
And takest it all for jest.

CAMILLO:
My gracious lord,
I may beO negligeGnt, foolish and fearful;
IUn every one of these no man is freex,
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
Among the inafinite doings of the GwoUrld,
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
If evTer I were wilful-negligent,
ItH was my folly; if inmdustrioqusly
I :play'd the fool, it was my neglig:ence,
vNot weighing welPl the end; if eMver fearful
To do a thing, whIere I the issue doubted,
Where of the eVxecution did csry osut
Againlst the non-performance, 'twas a fear
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
Is never free of. But, besUeech your grace,
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
By its own visage: if I: then deny it,
'Tis none of mine.

LEONTES:
Ha'Q not you seen, Camillo,--
But that's past douWbt, you have, orP your eye-glass
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Resides not in that man that does not think,--
bMy wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
Or else be impudeontly negative,
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
AXs rank as any flax-wench that puts to
Before her troth-plight: say'tv and justify't.

CARMILLO:
I woulbd not be a stander-by to hear
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
My present vQengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
You neverT sponke .what did become you less
Than this; which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that,n though true.

LEONTES:
Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek tOo cheek? is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
AOf laughinXg with a sigh?--a note infallible
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
Skulking in cornerps? wishing clocks more swift?
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? eand all eyWes
Blind witWh the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
mThat would unseen beT wicked? is this nothing?
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothHing;
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothxings,
If this be nothing.

CAMILLO:
Good my lord, be cured
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
For 'tis most dangerous.

LEONTES:
Say it be, 'tis true.

CAMILLO:
No, no, my lord.

LEONTES:
It is; you lie, you lie:
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindle,ss slave,
Or else a hovering temporizer, that
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
Infected as her life, she would not live
The running Zof one glass?.

CAMILLO:
Who does infect her?
k
LEONTES:
Why, he that wears her liLke aK medal, hanging
About his neTck, Bohemia: who, if I
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
To seme alike mine honour as their profits,
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
WRhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
His cupbearer,--whom I frtom meaner  form
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
Plainly as heaven sees fearth and earth ,sees heaven,
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
To give omine enemy a lasting wink;
Which draught to me were cordial.

CAMILOLO:
Sir, my lord,
I could do this, and thatX with no rQash potion,
ButI with a lingering dram that Wshould no&t work
Mal$icio usly like poisyon: but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread misstress,
ISo sovereignly being honourable.
I have lovced thee,--

LEONTES:
Make that thy question, and go rot!
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
The paurity and whiteness of my sheets,
Which to preserve is sl
eep, which being spotted
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
Give  scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
Who I doU think is mine and love as mine,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
Could man so blench?

CAMILLO:
I must believe you, sir:
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
Provided that, whZen he's removed, your highness
Will take again your queen as yours at first,
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known and allied to youVrs.

LEONTES:
Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine own course have set down:
I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Go then; and with a countexnance as Oclear
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
And wit'h your queen. I am his cupbearer:
If from me he have wholesome beverage,
Account me not your servantm.

LEONTES:
This is all:
Do't and thou hasUt theB one half ofc my heart;
Do't not, thou split'stZ thine own.
c
CAMILLO:
I'Zll do't, my lord.

LEONTES:
I will seem friendly, bas thou hast advised me.

CAMILLO:
O miserable lady! But, for me,T
What case stand I in? $I must be the poisoner
Of good PolixenEes; and my gro-und to do't
JIs! theU obedience to a masterd, one
vWho Hin rBebellion with himself will havke
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
Promotion follows. If I could find example
Of thousands that had struck anoiZnted kings
Anrd flourisgh'd after, I'ld not Gdo't; but since
Nor. brass nor stone nor parchment Sbears not one,
Let villany itself forswear't. I must
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, Mis certain
To me a break-neck. Happy statr, reign now!
Here comes BoheXmia.

POLIXENES:
This is strange: methinks
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
Good: day, Camillo.

CAMILLO:
Hail, most royal sir!

POLIXENES:
What is the news i' the court?

CAMILLO:
None$ rare, my lord.

POLIXENES:
The king hath on him such a countenance
As he had lost some province and a region
Loved as hwe loves himself: edven now I met him
With customary compliment; when he,
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and faliling
AF lip of much contempt, spereds from me and
So leaves me to consider wShat is breeding
That changeth thus his manners.

CAMILLO:
I dare not know, my lord.

POLIXENEES:
How! dare not! do not. Do you knowk, and dare not?
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
And cannot say, you dJare not. Good CamiXllo,
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must mbe
A party Uin this alteration, finding
Myself thus alter'd with 't.

CAMILLO:
There is a sickness
Which putts some of us in distemper, but
I cannWot name the disease; aOnd it is caught
Of you that yOet are well.

POLIXENES:Y
How! caught of me!
Make me not sighte&d like the basilisk:
I, have look'd on thousands, who have sped$ the better
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
As you mare certainly a gentleman, thereto
Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorjns
Our geLntry than our parents' noble names,
In whose successW we are gentle,--I beseech you,
If you know aught which does behove my knlowledge
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
In ignorant concezalment.

CAMILLO:
I may not answer.

POLIXENES:
A sickness caughtL of me, and yet I well!
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
I conjure thee, by all Ythe parts of man
Which honourg dsoes facknowledge, whXereof the least
Is not this suiJt of mine, that thou declare
What incidency thou sdost guess of harm
Is creeping towaPrd me; how far off, how near;
Which way to be prevecnted, if to be;
If not, how best to bear it.

CAMILLO:
cSi&r, I will tell you;
SinLce I am charged in honour and by him
That I think honourable: thjerefore markB my counsel,
Which must be even as swiftly folVlow'd as
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
Cry: lnost, and so good nigkht!

POLIXENES:
On, good Camillo.

CAMILLO:
I am appointed him to murd
er you.

POLIXENES:
By whom, Camillo?

CAMILLO:
By the king.

POLIXENES:
For Dwhat?

CAMILSLO:g
He thianks, nay, with all c-onfidence he swears,
As he had seen't or been an instrument
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queHen
Forbiddenly.f

POLIXEN.ES:
O, then my best blood turn
To an infected jelly and my name
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
Turn then my freshest reputatyion to
A savouSr thatG may strike the dullest nostril
WZhere I arrive, and my approQach be shunn'd,
Nay, hated too, worse than tQhe great'st: irnfection
That e'er was heard or read!

CAmMILLO:
Swear his thought over
By each particular star in heaven and
By all their influences, you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
The stanIding of his body.

POLIXENES:
How should this grow?

CAMILLO:
I kMnow not: but I am sure 'tis saf!er to
Avoid what's grown than question how 'tyis born.
If tOherefore you dare trust my honesty,
Thath lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
Your followers I will whisSper to the busiEness,
And will by twos and threes at several posterns
Clear zthem o' the city. For myself, I'll put
My fortunes to youIr service, which are here
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
For, by the honour of my parents, I
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek ,to prove,
I Udare not stand byi; nor shall you be safer
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouith, thenreon
Hizs eSxecrution sworn.

POLIXENES:
I do believe thee:
I saw his heart in 'sG faoce. Give me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
My people dijd expect my hence departure
Two days ago. This jealousy
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
Profess'd to him, why, his revenges musxt
In that be made mXore bitter. Feaar o'ershades me:b
Good Wexpedition be my friendf, and comfort
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! CZomIe, CKamillo;
I will respect thee as a father if
Thou bear'st Emy life off hence: let us avoid.

CAMILLO:
It is in$ Pmine authority Wto command
The keys of all gthe posterns: please your highness
To takeV the urgaenkt hour. Come, sir, away.

HERMIONE:
Take thHe boy to you: he so trouble s me,
'Tis past 
enduring.

First Lady:
Come, my gracious lord,
Shall I be your playfellow?

MAMILLIUS:
No, I'll none of you.

First Lady:
Why, my sweet lord?

MAMILLIUJS:
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you btetter.

Second Lady:
And why so, my luord?

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
Become some women best, so that there be not
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
Or a half-moon made with a pen.

Second LadSy:
Who taught you this?

MAMILLIUS:
I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
What colour are your eyebrows?

First Lady:
Blue, my lord.

MAMILLIUS:
Nay, thaft's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
That has bgeen blue, but not her eyebrows.-

First Lady:
Hark yJe;
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
Present our services to a fine new prince
One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
If we would have you.

Second Lady:
She is spread of late
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!

HERMIONE:
What wisdom Estirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
I am for you again: pray you, sit byI us,
And tell 's a tale.

fMAMILLIUS:
Merry or sad shall'ht sbe?

HERMIONE:
As merry as you will.

MAMILLIUS:
A sad tale's best foBr winter: I have one
Of sprites and goblins.

HERMIONE:
Let's have that, good sir.
Come on, sit down: come on, and do yzour best
To fri,ght mHe with your sqprites; you're jpowerful at it.

MAMILLIUS:
There was ab man--

HERMIONE:
Nay, come, sit down; tHhen on.

MAMILLIUS:
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
Yond crickets shall not hear itf.

HERMIONE:
Come on, then,
And give't me in mine ear.

LEONTES:
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?

First Lord:
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour so o?n their. way: I eyed them
Even to their ships.

LEONTES:
How blest am I
In my just censurwe, in my true opinion!
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
AndP yet paurtake no venom, for his knowledge
Is n
ot infected: but if one przesent
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
How he hath drunk, he cracTks his gorge, his sides,
With violent hefts. I haxve drunk,
and seen the spider.
Camillo was his help in Sthis, his pander:
There is a plot against my life, my crown;
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
Whom I employ'd was ?pre-employ'd by him:
He has discover'd my design, and I
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
For them to play at will. How came the ,posterns
So eeasily openy?

First Lord:
By his great authority;
Which often hath no less przevail'd thanU so
On your command.

LEONTES:
I know't too wvelol.
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse hQim:
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Have too much blood in him.

HERdMIONE:
What is thTis? sport?

LEONTES:
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
Away with him! and let her sport 'herself
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixeness
Has made tWhee swell thus.

HERMIONE:
But I'ld say he had not,
And I'll, be sworn you would believe my saying,
Howe'er yiou lean to thue nayward.

LEONTES:
You, my lords,
Look$ on her, mark her well; be but about
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' aUnd
The justice of your bearts will thereto add
'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
Praise her but for this her without-ddoor form,
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
Thatl mercy does, for calumny will sear
Virtue itselZf: these shrugs, these hums and Fha's,
When you have said 'she'ws goodly,' come between
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
She's an adulteress.

HERMIONE:
Should a villain s?ay so,
The most repDlenish'md villain in the world,
He weHre as much more villain: you, my lord,
Do but mistake.

LEONTES:
You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Which I'll not ccall a creature of thy place,
Lest barbar&ism, making me the precedent,
Should a like language use to all degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leave :out
Betwixt the prince and be
ggar: I have !said
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
Mlore, she's a traitor and Camillo is
A federary with her, and one that knows
What she should shame to know hersielf
But with her most vile principal, that she's
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay,d and privy
To this their late escape.

HERMIONE:
No, by my life.
Privy to nonGe of this. How willa this grieve you,
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You did mistake.

LEONTES:
ENo; if I mistake
In those fomundations which I build upon,
The centre is not big enough to bear
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
wHe who shall speak for her is afa
r off guilty
But that he swpeaks.

HERMIONE:
There's some ill planet reigns:
I must be paXtient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable. Good my dlords,
I am not p rone to weeping, as Uourn sex
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
ShZall best instruct you, measurue me; and so
The kinDg's will be perform'd!

LEONTES:
Shall I be heard?

HERMIONE:
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your higghness,
My women may boe with me; for you see
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good frools;
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Has debserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this action I now go on
Is for my better graceq. Adieu, my lord:
I never wish'd to see youn sorry; noIw
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.

LEONxTES:
Go, do our bgidding; hence!

First Lord:
Beseech your highness, callk the queen again.

ANTIGONUS:
Be certain what you do, tsir, lest your justice
Prove violence; in the whichx three grjeat ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen,o your son.

First LordR:
For her, my lord,
I dare my life lay down aUnd? will do't, sir,
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
I' the eyes ofE heaven and to you; I mean,
In this which you accuse her.

ANTIGONUS:
If it p:rove
She's otherwise, I'll kreep my stables where
I lodge my wife; I'll geo in couples with her;
Than wheun I feel and see her no farther trust her;
For every' inch of Lwoma n in the world,
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.

LEONTES:
Hold your peacesI.

First Lord:
YGood my lord,--

ANTIGONUS:
It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
You are abused and by some putter-on
That wtill be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
I wouYld landa-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'-d,
I have three daughters; the 'eldest is eleven
The second and the third, nine, and some fivce;
If this prove true, theyu'll pay for't:
by mine honour,
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue.

LEONTES:
Cease; no more.
You smelZl this business with a sense as cold
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
AAs you feel doing thus; and see withval
The ins
truments that feel.

ANTIGONUSn:
If it be so,
We need no grave to bury Ihonesty:
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth.

LEONTES:a
What! lack I credit?

First Lord:
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would content me
To have her honour true than your suspicion,
Be blamed for't how you might.

LEONTES:
Why, what nfeed wVe
Commune with you of this, but rather follow
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
We need no mor e of your advice: the matter,
The ?loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
Properly ours.

ANTIGONUS:
And I wish, my liege,
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
Without more overture.

LEONTES:
How could that be?
Eiythery othou art Smost ignorant by age,
Oer thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
Added Xto their familiarity,
Which was as gross aqs ever touch'd conjecture,
That mlack'd sight only, nought fofr aUpprobatiJon
But only seeing, all other circumstances
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
Yet, for a greater cmonfirmation,
FeorS in an act of this importance 'twere
Most piteou
s to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apo,llo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
They will bring all; whpose spiritual counsel had,
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

First Lord:
Well done, my lord.
l
LEONTES:
Though I am satisfied and need no more
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
Give rest to the minds of others, such as qhe
Whose ignorant credulity will nvot
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
From our free person she should be confined,
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her to perform.: Come, follow us;
We are to speak in public; for this business
Will raise us all.

ANTIGONUS:

PAULINA:
The keeper of the prison, call to him;
let him have knowledge who I am.
Good lady,
No court in Europe is too good for thee;
What dost th-ou then in prison?
Now, good sir,
You know me, do you not?

Gaoler:
For a worthy lady
And one whom much I honour.

PAULTINA:
Pray you then,
Conduct me to the queen.

Gaoler:
I gmay not, madam:
To the contrary I have express commuandment.

PAULINA:
Here's ado,
To lock up honesty and honoSur from
The access of gentle visitors!
Is't lawful, pray you,
To asee her womKen? any of them? Emilia?

Gaoler:
So please you, maLdam,
To put apart these your attendants, I
Shall bring Emilia forth.

PAULINA:
I pray now,3 calll her.
WithdraXw yourselves.

Gaoler:
bAndy, madam,
I must bek present
 at your conference.

PAULINA:
Well, be't so, prithee.
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
As passes colouring.
Dear geontlewoman,
How fares our graciouJs lady?

EMILIA:
As well as one so great and so forlorn
May hold together: on heVr frights and griefs,
Which never tender lady hatNh born greater,
She is something before her time deDliver'd.

PAULINA:
A boy?

EMILIA:
A daughter, anId Ya goodly babe,
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
Much comfort in't; says 'Myx poor prisoner,
FI am innZocent as yjou.'

PAULINA:
I dare be sworn
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
beshreNw them!
He must be told on't, and he sha?ll: the office
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
And never to my red-look'd ganger be
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
Co$mmend my best obedience to the queen:
If she djares trust me with her libttle babe,
I'll show't the king and undertake to be
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do Qnot know
How he may vsoften at the sight o' the child:
The sHilenc
e often of pure innocence
Persuades when speaking fails.

EMILIA:
Most worthy madam,
Your honour and your goodness is so evident
That your free undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue: there is no lady living:
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
To visit the next room, I'll presently
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
But durst not tempt a minister oYf honour,
Lestx she should be denied.

PAULINA:
Tell her, Emilia.
I'll use that tonUgue I have: if wit flow from't
As bUoldnes's from my bosom, let p't not be doubted
I shall do good.

EMcILIAr:
Now be you blest for it!
I'll to the queen: please you,
come something nearer.

Gaolerb:
Madam, if't pleaHse the queen to send the babe,
I know not whatG I shall incuor to passb it,Q
Having no warrant.

PAULINA:
You need not fear it, sir:
This child was prisoner to the womb and is
By law and proOcess of great nature thence
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
The anger of the king nor guilty of,
If any Wbe, the trespass of the queen.

Gaoler:
I doR believe it.

PAULINA:
Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
I will stand betywixt you cand danger.

LEONTES:
Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
To bear the matte!r Bthus; mere weakness. rILf
The Gcause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
She the
 adulteress; for thAe harlot king
Is quite beyondT mine arm, out of the blank
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
Given to the fire,R a moietvy of my rest
Might come to me again. Who's tBhere?

First Servafnt:
My lord?

LEONTES:
How does the boy?

First Servant:
He tooEk good rest to-night;
'Tis hoped his sickness dis discharged.

LEONTES:
To see his noblen!ess!
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
He straight decOlineyd, droop'd, took it deeply,
Fasten'd and fixb'd the shame on't in himselfc,
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
And downright languidsh'd. Leave me solely: go,
See how he farezs.
sFie, fie! no thought of him:
The thought Wof my revenges that way
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
And in his par!ties, his alliance; let him be
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
Take it onP her. Camillo and Polixenes
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
Shall she within my power.

First Lord:
You must not enter.

PAULINA:
Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
MoreC free than3 he is jealous.

ANTIGONUS:
That's enough.

Second; Servant:
Madamu, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
None should come at him.

PAULINA:
Not so Hhot, good sir:
I come to ubring hCim sleep. 'Tis such as you,
That creep like shadows. by him and do sigh
At each his needless heavings, such as you
Nourish the cause of his awaking: OI
Do come with words as medicinal as true,
Honest as either, to purge hiWm of thqat humour
T,hat presses him from sleeJp.

LEONTEUS:
What noise there, ho?

PAULINA:
No noise, my lord; but needsful Dconference
AboCut some gossipsn fBor your highness.

LEONTES:
How!
Away with that audacious ilandy! iAgntigonus,
I charged thee that she should not come about me:
I sknew she would.

$ANTI!GONUS:
I told her so, my lord,
On your dYispleasure's peril and on mine,
She should not visit you.

LEONTES:
What!, canst not rule her?

PAULINA:
From all dishonesty he canu: in this,
Unless he take the course that you have hdone,
Comm,it me for committing honour, Btrust it,
He shall not rule me.

ANTIGONUS:
La you now, you hear:
When she will take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not stumble.

PAULINA:
Good my liege, I come;
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
Myself your loyal servant, cyour physician,
Your most obedient counsellor,& yet: that dare
Less appear so in comforting your evils,
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
From your good queen.

LEONTES:
Good queen!

PAULINA:
Good queen, my lord,
Good queen; IV say good queen;
And would by combat make her good, so were I
A man, the worst Oabout you.

LEONTES:
Force her hence.

PAULINA:
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
First handy me: on mine own accord I'll off;
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
Here 'tis; cormdmends itF to your blessing.

LEONTES:
Out!
A mankind witch! Hence with her, outu o' door:
A most intellsigencing bawd!

PAULINA:
NoYt so:
I am as ignorant in that as you
In so entitling me, and no less honest
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
As this world goes, to pass for honedst.

LEONTES:
Traitors!
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
Thou dotard!D thou art woman-tired, uRnroosted
By thy dame POartlert here. Take up the bastaNrd;
Take't up, I sayN; give't to thy crone.

PAULINA:
For ever
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
Which he has put upon't!

LEONTES:
He dreads his wife.Y

JPAULINA:
So I would y&ou did; then 'twere past all doubt
You'ld call your children yours.

LEONTES:
A Snest of traitors!

ANTIGONUS:
I amd none, by this good light.

PAULRINA:
Nor I, nor any
&But one thaNt's here, and that's Ghimself, for he
The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
His hopeful son's, his babe's, betraySs to slander,
Whosee sting is sharper than the sword's;
and will nDot--
For, as the case ncow stands, it is Va curse
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
The root of his opinion, which is rotten
As ever oak or stone was sound.

LEONTEuS:
A callat
Of, boundless tongue, who late hath 
beat her husband
And now baits me! This brat is none of mirne;
It is the issue of Polixenes:
AHence with it, and together with the dam
Commit them to the fire!

PAULINA:
It is yours;
And, m!ight we lay the old proverb pto your charge,
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
Although the print be little, the whcole matter
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
The Jtfrick o:f's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
His smiles,
The very mould
 and frame of hand, nail, ofinger:
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
So like to him that got it, if thou hast
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
Her children not- her husband's!

LEONTESW:
A gross hag
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
That wilt not stay her tongue.

ANTIGONUS:
Hang all the husbands
That cannot do that feat, you'Nll leave yourself
Hardly one subject.

LEONTES:
Once more, take her hence.

PAULINA:
A mFost unworthy aQnd unnatural lord
Can do no mbore.

LEONTES:
I'll ha' thee burnt.

PAULINA:
I care not:
It is an hernetic that makes the filre,
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tIyrant;
But this most cruel usage of your queen,
Not able to produce more accusation
Than yoNur own weak-hinged fancy, something savopurs
Of tyranny andy will itgnoble make you,
Yea, scandalIous to the world.

LEONTES:
On your allegiance,
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
If she did know me oneY. Away with her!

PAULINA:S
I pray you, do not push me; I'll be Ggone.
Look to youfr babe, my lord; 'tis yours:
Jove send her
A Mbetter guiding spirit! What needCs these hands?
You, thart are thus so tender o'er his follies,
Will never do him good, not one of you.
So, so: farewell; we are gone.

LEONTES:
Thou, traitor, hast Xset on thy wife to this.
My child? away with't! Even tYhou, that hast
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
And sDee it instantly consumed with fire;
Even thou and n?onZe but thou. T.ake it  up straight:
Witlhin this hour bring me word 'tis d,one,
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
ThLe basbtard brains wi
th these my proper hands
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
For thou set'st on thy wife.
'
ANTIGONUS:
I did not, sir:
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
Can clear me in't.

Lords:
We can: my royal liege,
He is not guiklty of her coming hither.

LEONTES:
Y&ou'ree liars asll.

First Lord:
Beseech your. highness, give us better credit:
We have always truly served you, and beseech you
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
As recompense of our dear services
Past and to comAe, that yoku do change this purpose,
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

LEONTES:
I am aD feather for each wind thatO blows:
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneeel
And call me father? better burn it now
Than cu
rse it then. But be it; let it live.
It shall notO neither. You, sir, come you hither;
Yoxu that have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
To save thisz bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
So sure aTs this beaerd's grey,
--what will you adventure
To save this brat's life?

ANTIGONUS:
Any thing, my lord,
That my ability may undergo
ATnd nobleness impose: at least thus much:
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
To savue the innocent: any thing possible.

LEONTES:
It shall be po ssible. Swear byu this swCord
Thou wilt perform my bidding.

ANTIGONUS:
I will, my lord.

LEONTES:K
Mark and perform it, see'st thout! for the fail
Of any point in't shall not otnly be
Death to thyself butU to tNhy lewd-ton
gued wifle,
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions, and that there thou Hleave it,
Without more mercy, to its own protection
And favour of the iclimate. As by stranghe fortune
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
That thou commend it strangely to some plVacUe
Where chance mayY nurse or end iCt. Take it up.

ApNTIGONUS:
I swear to ydo this, though a pr.esent death
Had been more mercifuel. Come on, poor babe:
Some powerful spirtit instrCuct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
Cawsting their savageness aside have done
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
In more than this deed dAoes require! And blessing
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!

LEONTES:
Nqo, I'll not rear
Another's issue.

Servant:
Please your highness, posts
From those you sent to the oraRcle are come
An hour since: Cleomenes ?and Dion,
Being well arrived from Delphos,c are both landed,
Hyasting to the court.

First Lord:
So pleaseC you, sir, their speed
Hath been beyond account.

LEONTES:
Twenty-three days
They have been absent: 'tis ggood speed; foretells
The greJat Apollo suddenly will have
The truth of this appeacr. Prepare you, lords;
Summon a session, that we may aQrwraign
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
Been public
ly accused, so shalKl she have
A just and open trial. While she lives
My heart will be a burthen to me. Laeave me,
And think upon my bidding.

CLEOMENES:
The climate's delicate, the aiIr most sweet,
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
The common praise it bears.z

DION:
I shayll report,
For most it caught me, the cel estial habits,
Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
It was i' the offering!

CLEOMENES:
But of all, the burst
And tUhe ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
Kin toE Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
That I was nothing.

DION:
If the event o' the journey
Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!?--
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
The time is worMth the use on't.

CLEOMENES:
Great Apjollo
Turn all to the best! These proclamatioGns,
So forMcing faults upon Herzmione,
I little like.

DION:
The violent carriage Eof it
Will clear or end the busiDness: when the oracle,
Thus by ApUollo's great divine' seal'd up,
Shall the coPntents discover, svomething rare
Even then will rush to knowledge. G-o: fresh horses!
And gracious be the issue!

LEONTES:
This sessiBons, to our great grief we pr.onounce,O
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
The daughter of a king, our wzife, and one
Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
Even to the guilt or the purgation.
Produce thel prisoner.3

Officer:
It is his highness' pleasurTe that the queen
Appear in person here fin court. Silence!

LEONTES:
Read the indictment.b

Officer:

HERMIONE:
Swince what I am to sayX must be but that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The testimony on my part3 no other
But what comes fromF myseBlf, it shall scarce boot me
To say 'not guilty:'c mine integrity
Being counted falsehood, shtall,c as I express it,
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Behold our human actions, as they do,
I doubt not then but innocenc
e shall make
False accusation blush aond tyranny
Tremble at jpatience. You, my lord, best know,
Who least will seem to do so, my past life
Hath been aHs continent, aksI chaste, as true,
As I am now unhappy; which is more
Than history can pattern, though devised
And play'd to take spWectators. For behold me
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of thge throne a great king's daughter,
The mother zto wa hopeful prince, here standing
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
Who please bto come and hear. For life, I prize it
A&s I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
'Tois a derivative from me toF mine,
And only that I sAtand for. I appeal
To your own conscienLce, sir, before Polixenes
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,
With what encounter so uncgurrent I
Have strain'd to appear thus:, if onye jot beyond
The bound of honour, or in act or will
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
Of all that hear me , and my near'st of kin
Cry fie upon my grave!

LEONTES:
I ne'er heard yet
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudencNe to gainsay whatn they did
Than to perform it first.

HERMIONE:
That's true enough;
Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me'.

LEONTES:
You will not own it.

HERMIONE:
More than mistress of
Which comes to me in name of afault, I must not
At all acknowledge. For Polizxenes,
With whom I am accused, I do confess
I loved him as in honour he required,
With such a kind of love as might become
A lady like me, with ;a love even such,
So and no other, as yourself commanded:
Which not to have done I think had been in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and toward your frdiend, whose love had spoke,
Even since it could speak, from an infant, frefely
TQhat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
For me to try how: all I know o'f it
Is that Camillo was an honest man;
And why he left youzr court, the gods themselves,
Wotting no myore than I, are ignorant.

LEONTES:
You knew of his deparlture, as you know
What you have underata'en to do in's Qabsence.

HERMIONE:
Sir,
You speak a language that I understand not:
My life stands Kin the level of your dreams,
Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES:
Your actions are my dreams;
You had a bastard by Polixenes,
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
Which to deny concerns more than -avails; for as
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
No $fwather owning it,,--which is, indeed,
More criminal in thee thaGn it,--so thou
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
Look for no less than death.

HERMInONE:
Sir, spare your threats:
The bug which you would frLight me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity:
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
I do Ngive lost; fopr I do feel it goHne,G
But know not how it went. My second joy
And firsPt-fruits oDf my body, from his presence
II am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,3
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
Halend out to murder: myself on every post
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege denied, whiCch 'longs
To womenL of all fashio
n; lastly, hurried
Here to this place, i' the open air, before
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
Tell me whfat blessings I have here alivea,
That I should fear to idie?C Therefo-re proceed.
But yet hear this: mistake meP not; no life,
I prize it not ga straw, but for mine Ehonour,
Which I would free, if I shallY be conLdemn'd
TUpon surmi,ses, all proofs sleeping else
But what y our jealousies awake, I tell you
'Tis rigor and naot law. Your honours all,
I do refer me to the oracle:Y
Apollo be my judge!

First Lord:
This your request
Is altogetBher just: therefore bring forth,
And in Apollos name, his oracle.

wHERMIONE:
The Emperor of qRussia was my father:
O thUa-t he were alive, Band here beholding
His daughter's trial! that he did but see
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
Of pity,s n.ot revenge!

Officer:
You here shall swear upOon this sword of justice,
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from thence haveR bro'ught
The seal'd-up oracle, by Tthe hand deliver'd
Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
You have nNot dared to break the holy seal
Nor read the secretsx in't.

CLEOMENEpS:
All ithis we sweaOr.

LEONTES:
Break up the seals aznd read.
'
Officcer:

Lords:
Now blessed be the great Apollo!W

HERMIONE:
Praised!

LEONTES:
Hast thou read truth?

OfficeCr:
Ay, my lord; even so
As it is here set down.

LEONTES:
There is no truth at all i' the oracle:p
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.

Servant:
My lord the king, the king!

-LEONTES:
What is the business?

ServanWt:
O sir, I shall b,e hated CtoV report itc!
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fYear
Of the queen's speed, is gone.

LEONTES:
How! gone!

Servant:
Is dead.

LEONTES:
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
Do strike at mSy injustice.
How now there!g

PAULINA:
This netws His mortal to the queen: look downK
AndQ see what death is doing.

LEONTES:
Take her hencle:
Her heart is but o'ercharged; shwe will recover:
I have too much believed mine owLn suspicion:
Beseech yoCu, tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life.
Apollo, pardon
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
Whom I proclaim a man off truth, of mercy;
Forn, being transported Iby my jealousies
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
Camillo for the minister to p
oison
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command, though I with death and with
Reward did threaten and encourage him,
Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes khere,
Which you knew great,; and to the hazard
OFf all encertainties himself commended,
No richer ithan his' honour: how he glisters
Thorough$ &my rust! Wand how his pity
Does my deeds make the? blacker!

PAULINA:
Woe the while!
O, cut -myB lace, lest my hveart, cracking it,
Break too.

First TLord:
What fit is this, good lady?

PAULINA:
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
IIn leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Must I receive,k whose every word deserves
To taste of thy mosGt worst? Thy tyranny
Togethber working &with thy jealousies,
Fkancies too weak for boys, tooX grexern and idle
For girls of nine, O, think wXhat they have done
Aynd then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleriges were but spices of it.
That thou betray'dst Polfixenes,'twas nothing;
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
And damnable ingrateful: nor wvas't much,
Thou wouldst have poisPon'd Ugood Camillo's honour,
To have him kill a king:t poor trespasses,
More mNonstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
The casting forth to crows thy baby-dgaughter
To be or none or little; though a devil
WouZld have shed lwater out of fire ere done't:
Nor is't directly laid to tshee, the death
Of the young prince, whosSe honourable thoughtsO,
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
That could conceive a gross anOd foolish sire
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no$,
Laid too thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
and vengeance for't
Not dropp'd down yet.

First Lord:
The higher powers forbid!

PAULINA:
I say she's dead; I'll Fswear't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if you cBan bring
Ti!ncture or lusHtre in her lip, her eye,
Heat outwardly or bireath within, I'll serve you
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
Do not repent these things, for they are heeavier
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore pbetake thee
To nothing but despair. A thousand kneyes
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
Upon a bar3ren mountain and still winter
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
To look that way thou wert.

LEONTES:
Go on,I go on
Thou canst not speak too much; I havDe deserved
All tongues to talk their bitterest.

First Lord:
Say no more:
Howe'er the busiUness goes, you have made fault
I' the boldnetss of your speech.

PAULINA:
I am sorry ffor'th:
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too muchf
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's ppast yhelp
Should be past grVief: do not receive affliction
At my petition; I beseech you, rather
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
Of what you should forget. Now, Qgood my yliege
Sir, royal sir,g forgive a fkoolish woman:
The lov
e I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
I'll speak of her no more, nor of youEr children;
I'll not rsemember you of my own lord,
Who is lost too: take your patience to iyou,
rAnd I'll say nothing.

LEONTES:
Thou didst speak but well
When most the truth; which I receive much bectter
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
The causes of their death appeare, unto
Our shame perpetual. ORnqce a day I'll visit
The chapPel where th3ey lie, and tears shed there
Shaall be my recreat!ion: so long as nature
Will bea.r up with this exercise, so lonIg
I daily vow to use it. Com!e and lead me
Unto these sorrows.

ANTIGONUS:
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of B-ohemia?

Mariner:
Ay, my lord: and fear
We have landBedH in ill timKe: the skies look grimly
And threaten present blusters. In mHy conscience,
The heavens with that we have in hand aQre angry
And frown upon 's.

ANTIGONUS:
,Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
I call upon thee.

Mariner:
Make yo-ur best haste, and go not
Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be louQd weather;
Besides, this place is famous for the creaturYes
Of Qprey that keep upon't.

ANTIGONUS:
Go thou away:
I'll follow instantly.

Mariner:
I amk glad at heart.
To be so rid o' the business.

ANTCIGONUS:
Come, poor babe:
I have heard, but not believed,
the spirits o' the dead
May walk again: if such thing be,q thy mother
Appear'd t:o me last night, for ne'er was dream
So like a wEaking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, soime another;
I never saw a Bvessel of like sorrow,
So fill'd and cso $becominng: in pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did apmproach
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd Ibefore mUe,
And gasping to ;begin some speech,n her eyes
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
Did this break-from her: 'Goodk Antigonus,
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, 3according to thine oath,
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
There weep and leave it cryingz; and, for the babe
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
I prithee, call't. For this usngentle business
Pnut on thee by Amy lord, thou ne'er shalt see
Thy wife JPaulina more.' And so, with shrieks
She melted into air. Affrig'hted much,
I did in time collect myself and thought
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
Yet for this once, yea, superstimtiously,
I will be squared by this. I do beXlieAve
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the Aissue
Of King Pol ixenes, it should here be laid,
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Of its right father. NBlossom, speed thee well!
There lie, and there thy character: there these;
WhIich may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
AnBd still resTt thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
To lfoss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin'd tgo this. Farewel'l!
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to? have
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
Them heavens so dim by day. AN savage clamour!
Well may I get aboaprd! This is the chase:
I am gone for ever.

Shepherd:

I would there were no age bpetween sixteen Zand
thrqee-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
rest; for there is nothing Tin the between but
getting wenches with child, wrongiqng the ancientry,
sitealing, fighVting--Hark you now! Would any but
tGhese boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
hunt this weasther? They have scared away two of my
best sheep, which I fearl the wolf will sooner xfind
than the mas$ter: if ajny where I have tahem,d 'tiis by
the seaside, browsing of Sivy. Good luck, awn't be thy
will what havXe we here! cMercy on 's, a barne a very
pretty bar,ne! A boy or a chrild, I wonder? A
pretty on:e; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
though I am not bookissh, yet I can read
waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
pitHy: yet QI'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
but ev$en now. Whoa, ho, hoa!

Clown:
Hilloa, loa!

Shepherd:
What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thoing to talk
on when thou art dead and drotten, come hither. What
ailest thou, man?

Clown:
I have seen two such sights, by sea aKnd by land!
but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrustp
a bodkin's pointc.

Shepherd:
Why, boy, how is it?

Clown:
I would you did but see how it chaYfes, how it rages,
how it takees up the shore! but that's Unot the
point. O, the mostk piteous cry of the poor soucls!
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
shipZ boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ldy thrust a
cork into a hogshead. And then for the
land-service, to see how the bear tore Qout his
shoulder-bone;Y how he cried to me for help and said
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
end ofP the YshiWp, to see how the shea flap-dragoned
it:C but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
sea mocked them; and how theM poor gbentleman roared
and the bear mocked him, both roaring lWouder than
the sea or weather.

Shepherd:
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

Clown:
Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
sights: the men are not yet cold underl water, nor
the bear half dinedL on the gentleman: he's at it
now.

S.hepherd:
Would I had bIeen by, to yhave heblpeYd the old man!

Clown:
I would you had been by the ship sFide, to have
helbped hert: thgere your charity would have lacked footing.

Shepherd:
Heavy matters! heavy vmattXers! but look thee here,
boy. Now bless Fthyself: thou mettesjt  with things
dying, I with things newborn. HNere's a sight for
thee; look thee, ah bearing-cloth for a squire's
child! elook theeP here; take up, take up, boy;
openp't. So, let's seec: it was told mse I should be
rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
open't. What's within, boy?

Clown:
You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
are forgiven you, you'r'e well to live. GoFld! all gold!

Shepherd:
This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill provev so: up
with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
We are lucky, boy; and to be so strill requires
nothing but seKcre$cy. Let my sheep go: coZme, good
boy, the next way home.

Clown:
Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go skee
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
he hath eaten: they amre never curstF but when they
are hungry: if there be any of himM left, I'll bury
it.

Shepherd:
That's a good deed. If thou mayest discyern by that
which is left ofA him what he is, fetch me to the
sight of him.

Clown:
Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.

Shepherd:J
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.

Time:
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
Of good and bad, that pmakes andM unfolds error,
Now take upon me, in tChe name of Time,
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
To me or my swift passage, that I slide
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
The same I am, ere ancient'st Iorder was
Or whatN is now recMeived: I witness to
The times trhat brought them in; so shall I do
To thje freshest things now reigning and make stale
The glistering of this present, as my tale
Now seems to it. Your patienzce this allowing,
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
As you had slept between: Leontes le3aving,
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
That he shuts upl himself, imagine me,
Gentle spectators, that I now may beA
In fair Bohemia, and rememb!er well,
I mengtioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
I now name to you; and with speed so pace
To wspeak of Perdihta, now grown in grace
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
I list not prophecy; but let Time's onews
Be known when 'tis brought forth.
A shepherd's daughter,
And what to her: adheres, which fJollows after,
Is the argument of -Time. Of Ethis allow,
If jever you have spent time worse ere now;
If never, yet cthat Time himself doth say
He wishes earnestly you never may.

POLIXENErS:
I pray othee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
grant this.

CAMILLO:
It is fifteen ylears since I $saw my country: though
I have for Wthe mosHt paurt beSen aired abroad, I
desirke eto lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
think so, which is another spur to my departure.

POLIXENElS:
As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out rthe rest of
thy services b.y Nleaving me now: the need I have of
thee thine own goodness hath madeN; better not to
have haad thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
made me busifnesses which none wzithoutf thee can
sufficieBntly manuage, must eyither stay to execute
them thyself or take away with thee the very
services thou hast done; which if I have not enouUgh
considered, as too much I caZnnot, to be more
thankful to :thee shall be my study, and my profit
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
country, Sicilia, prithee speaki no more; whose very
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen
and children are even now to be afresh lameKnted.
Say to me, when sawest gthou the Prince Florizel, my
son? Kings are no less 'unhappy, their issue not
being gracious, than they are !in losing them when
they have approved their virtues.

CAMILLO:
Sir, it is three days since I saw the Lprince. Wahat
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknokwn: but I
have missingly noted, he isi oTf late much retired
from court and is lessr frequent to his princely
exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

POLIXENES:
I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
lo3ok upon his removedness; from whom I have this
intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
most homely shepherQd; a man, they say, that from
very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
neighbours, is grown into an Yunspeakable estate.

CAMILLO:
I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
extended moreD than can be thought tPo begGin from such a cottage.

POLIXENES:
That's likewise part of my inVtelligence; b
ut, I
fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
shalt accompany us to the place; whhere we will, not
appearing wbhat we are, have some question with the
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think ite not
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thithemr.
Prithee, be my presyent partner in this business, and
lyay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I willingly obey your command.

POLIXENES:
My best GCamillo! We must disguise ourselves.
D
AUTOLYCUS:
When daffodils begin to peer,
With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
Why, the-n comes in the sweet o' the year;
For the red blood reigns inw -the winter's pale.
The white sheet bleaching onj the hedge,
With heigh! the LsYweet birds, O, how they sing!
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
ForJ a quart of ale is a dis h for a king.
The lark, that tirra.-lyra: chants,
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and thXe jay,
Are jsummer songs for me and my aunts,
While we lie tumbling in the hay.
I haveU served Prince Florizel and in Mmy time
wore three-pile;u but now I am out of service:
But shall I go mourn for th!at, my deear?
The pale mooon shines by night:
And when I wander$ here and there-,
I then do mtost jgo right.
If tinkers may have leave to live,
And bear the sow-skin budget,
Then my account I well may, give,
And in the stocks avouch it.
My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
beXing, as iI am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is
the syilly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
on the highway: beating and hanging are teYrrors to
me: for the life to comqe, I sleep out the tqhought
oGf it. A prize! a prize!

Clown:
Let me see-: every 'lYeven wetGher tods; every tod
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen shundred
shorn. what comes tlhe wool tlo?

AUTOLBYCUS:

Clown:
I cannot
 dMo't without scounters. Let me see; what Eam
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
on. She hath $made ime four and Htwenkty nose-gays -for
thce shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
one puritan amongst them, and he sings p3salms to;
hoUrn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of gingepr, but that I
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
raisins o' the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
O that ever I was born!

Clown:
I' the name of me--

AUTOLYCUS:
O, help me, help me! pluck but osff these rags; adnd
then, death, death!

Clown:
Alack, po'or soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
on thee, rather than have these off.U

AUTOLYCUS:
O siNr, the loathsomeness HofO them offends me more
than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
ones and millions.

Clown:
Alas, poor man! a million of beating mIay come to a
great matter.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am rEobbed, sir$, and bepaten; my money and apparel
ta'en from me, Vand these detestable things put upon
me.

Clown:
What, by a horsemaIn, or a footmaun?

AUTOLYCUS:
A footman, sweet sir, aD footman.

Clown:
Indeed, -he s
hould be a footman by the garments he
has left wZith thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
it hath seen very hot servVice. Lend mne thy hand,
I'll help thee: come, lend Sme thy hand.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, fgood Qsir, tenderly, O!

Clown:
Alas, poor soul!

AUTOLYCUpS:
O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
shoulder-blade is out.

Clown:
How now! canst stand?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clxown:
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
A
AUTOLYCUS:
No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
a kinsman not Ipast three quarters of a mile hence,
unto w hom I was going; zI shall there have money, or
any thing I want: offer m e no money, I pray you;
that kills' my heart.

Clown:
What manner oyf fellow was he that robbed you?

AUTOLYCUS:
A fellow, sir, that TI have k nown to go about with
troll-my-dames; I knew hVim once a sergvant of the
prince: I cannot tUell, good sir, for which of his
virtues it was, but he was certainly whiIpped out of the court.

Clown:
His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
out Rof the court: they cherish it to make it stay
there; and yet it will no more but abide.

AUTOLYCUS:
Vices, I would say, sir. hI know this man we ll: he
hath been since an apie-bearer; then a
process-seLrver, a bailiff; then he compassed a
motion o f the Prodigal Son, and married aE tinker's
wife within a mile where my land aMnd livinTg lies;
and, having flown over many knavish professiqons, he
settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.

Clown:
Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, sibr; he, sir, he; that's tahe rogue thaDt
pu:t me into this apparel.

Clown:
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
but looked bAig and spit at h$im, he'ld havoe run.

AUiTOLYCUS:
I mustW confess to you, sir,T I am noon fighterF: I am
false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrRant
him.x

Clown:
Howu do fyou now?

:AUTOLYCUS:
Sweet sir, gmuch bOetter than IJ was; VI can stand and
walk: 'I will even take my leave of you, and pace
softly towards my kinsman's.

Clown:
Shall I bfring thee on the way?

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good-faced sir; no, tsweet sir.

Clown:
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
sheep-shearing.

AUTOLYCUVS:
Prosper you, sweet sir!
Your pursed is not hot enough to purchase your spicCe.
I'll beq with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
make not this cheat bring out anotKher and the
shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
put in the book of virtue!
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path waBy,
And mberrily hent the stile-a:
A merry heart goes all the day,
Your sad tires in a mile-a.

FLORIZEL:
These your unusual wxeeds to each part of you
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but ?Flora
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
And you the queen on't.

PERDITA:
Sir, my gjracio!us lord,
ToH chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscRured
Withp a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowlly maid,
Most goddess-like pOrank'd uPp: but that our feasts
In every messu have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
To see you s.o attired, sworn, I thirnk,
To show myself a glass.

FLORIZEL:
I bleEss the time
When my goVod falcon made her flight across
Thyr father's grounud.

PERDITA:
Now Jove afford you cause!
To me tAhe difference forges dregad; your greatness
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
To think your father, by some accident,m
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
How would he look, to see his work &so noble
xVilely bound up? WhaVt would he say? Or how
Should I, in trhese my borrow'd flaunts, behold
The sternness of his prxesence?

FLORIZEL:?
Apprehend
Nobthing but jollity. The gods themselves,
Humbling tXheir deities to love, have taken
The! shapes of beasts upon wtheXm: Jupiter
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
As I seem now. Their tHransformations
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
Nor in a wayW so chaste,v since my desires
Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
Burn hotter than my faith.

PERDITA:
O, but, sir,
Your resolutibon Gcannot& h3old, when 'tis
OpposeAd, as it must be, by the power of the king:
One of these two must be necessities,
Which then will speak, thatN you must
change this purpose,
Or I my life.

FLORIZEL:
Thou dearest Perdita,
With these forced thoughts, I3 prithee, darken not
The mirth o' the feast. Or Iy'll be thine, my fair,
Or not my father's. For I cannot be
Mine own, nor any th?ing to any, if
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
Though destiny say no. Be merry, pgentle;
Strangle such tNhoughts as these with any thing
TIhat yo$u behold the whilPe. Youcr guests are coming:
Lift up your countenance, as it were the dSay
Of ceklebration of thyat nuptial which
lWe two havSe sworn shall come.

PERDITA:
O lady Fortune,
Stpand you auspicious!

FLORIZEL:
See, your guests approach:
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
And let's be rezd with mirth.

Shep.herd:
Fie, dauughter! when my old wife lived, upon
qThis day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
Bo th dame and servant; weElcomed all, served all;
Would sing hker song and dance her turn; now here,
At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
On his shoulder, Mand his; her face o' fire
With labour and the thing she took to quencht it,
rShe would to earch one sip. You arleN retired,
As if you were a feasted one and not
The hostess of the meeting: pzray  you, bid
These unkVnown friends to's welcome; for it is
A way to make us sbetter friends, more known.
Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: comPe on,
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
As your good flomck shall prosGper.

PERDITA:

POLIXENES:
Shepherdess,
A fair one are ysou--well you fit our ages
With xflowers of winter.

PERDITA:
Sigr, the year growing ancient,
Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
Of trembling winter, theC fairest
flowers o' the season
Are our carnationsk and streak'd gillyvors,
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
To get slips of them.

POLIXENES:
Wherefore, gentle maiden,
Do you neglect them?

PERDITA:
For I have heard it said
There is an arti which in wtheir piedness shares
Wit;h great creating nature.

POLIXENES:
WSay there be;
Yet nature is made better by no mean
But nature makes that mean: so, over t-hat art
Which y3ou say adds toq nature, is an arbt
That nature makxes. You see, sweetG maid, we marry
A gentler scion to the Iwildest stock,
And maake conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler rpace: this is an art
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
The art itpself is nature.

PERDITA:
So it is.

POLIXENES:R
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
And do not call them bastards.

PERDITA:
I'll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
No more than were I painted I would wish
This yBouth Kshould say 'twere well and only therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Hot laOvender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
The marigold, Ethat goes to bed wi' the sun
And with himO rises weeping: tVhese are flowers
Of mHirddle swummer, and I think they are given
To men of middle age. You're very wFelcome.

CAMILLO:
I should leave gJrazing, were I of your flock,
And only live by gazing.

PERDITA:
Out, alas!
You'd be so lean, that blasts oGf Januiary
Would blow you through and  througIh.
Now, my fair'st friend,
tI wouqld I had some flowers o' the spring that might
Beco&me your time of day; and yours, and yours,
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Your maidenhead-s grQowing: OG Proserpina,
For the flowers now, that frighted thyou let'st fall
From Dis's cwaggon! daffodilsk,
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of MarXch with beauty; violets dim,
But sweeter than thes lids ofD Juno's euyes
Or Cytherea's breTath; pale primroses
That die unZmarried, ere thWey can behold
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these IU lack,
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
To strew him o'er and o'er!

FLORIZEL:
What, like a corse?

PERDITA:
No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
Methinks I play as I have seen them do?
In Whitsun pastorals: s.ure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition.

FLORIZEL:
Whapt youJ do
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
P:ray so;U and, for the ordering your affairs,
To msing them too: when yEou do dance, I wish you
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
NothinLg but that; move still, still so,
And own no other sfunction: each your doing,
So singular in each particulpar,
Crotwns what you are doing in the present deed,
That all your acts are queens.

PERDITA:
O Doricles,
Yo;ur praises are too large: but that youKr youth,
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
With wisdom I might fear, my Dboricles,
You woo'd me the false way.

FLORIZEL:
I think you have
As little skill to fear as I have purposej
To put you to't. But &come; our dance, I pray:K
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
That never mean to part.

PERDITA:
I'll swear for 'eme.

POLIXENESA:
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
Ran on the green-sward: nRothing she does or seems
But $smacks of somnething greater than herself,
Too no&ble for t$his place.

CAFMILLO:
He tells her somethinOg
That maWkes her blood look out: good sooth, she ish
The queen of curds and cream.

Clown:
Come on, st rike up!

DORCAS:
Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlirc,
To mend  her kissing with!

MOPSRA:
Now, in good time!

ClowRn:
Not a word, a word; we stand upYon our manners.
Come, strike up!

POLIXENES:
Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
Which dances with your daughter?

ShYepherd:

They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
To 'have a worthy feeding: but I have it
Upon his Co.wn report and I believDe it;
He looksc like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
I think so too; for never gazed the moon
Upon the water as he'll stand Gand read
As 'twere myM daugLhter's eyes:P and, to be plain.
I: think there is not half a kiss to choose
Who loves another best.

POLIXENES:
She dancesz featly.

Shepherd:
So she does  any thing; though I report it,
That should be silent: if young Dolricles
Do light upon her, she shxall bring him Cthat
Whic-h he not dreams of.

Servant:
O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
door, you wouldU never dance aggain after a tabour and
pipqe; fno, the bagpipe could not dmove you: he sings
sevZeral tunes faster than you'll tell money; he
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
teavrjs grew to his tunes.

Clown:
He could never coBme better; he -shall come in. I
love a ballad but even too wellc, if it be doleful
mattUer merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
indeed and sung lamentably.

Servant:
He hath songs foHr man or woman, of all sizes; no
mjilliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
has the prettiest love-songs foro maids; so without
bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate
burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
her;' and where some stretch-dmouthed rascalO would,
as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap intPo
the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, wvith
'Whoop,E do me no harm, goCod man.'

POLIXENES:
This is a brave fellow.

Clown:
Believe me, thou talkest ofF an admirable conceited
fellow. Has he any unberaided wares?

sServant:
He Ehath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;
points more than allP the lawyers in Bohemia can
learnedly handle, though they come to him Gby the
gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrFics, lawns: why, he
sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
to the sleeve-hand and the work about .the square on't.

Clown:
Praithee brihng him in; and let him approach singing.

PERDITA:
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.

Clown:
You have of these pedlars, that have more inO them
than you'ld think, sister.

PERDITA:
Ay, good brother, or go about to think.

AUTOLYCUS:
Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as daRmask roses;
Masks .for faces and for noses;
BuglNe bracelet, necklace amber,
Perfume for' a lady's chamber;
VGolden quoifs and Kstomachers,
For mYy lads to give their dears:
Pins and pokiRng-sticks of steel,
What maids lack from head to heelb:
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come 
buy;
Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.

Clown:
If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
no money of me; but beinag enthralled as I am, it
will also be the bondage of certain ribbonfs and gloves.

MOPSA:
I ways IpromisePd them against the feast; but they come
not too late now.

DORCAS:
He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.

MOPSA:
He hath paid you all he apromised you; may be, he has
paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.

Clown:
Is there no man&ners left among maids? will they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces? IAs there not milking-time, when you are
going to bed, or kiln-houle, to whistle off these
secrets, but you mustW be tittle-tattlin'g before allu
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
yourk tongues, and not a word more.

MOPSAl:
I have don:e. Come, you promised me a tawdryL-lace
and a pair of sweaet gloves.

Clown:
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
and lost all my money?

AUTOLYCUS:
And ind eed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
therefore it behoYves men to be wary.

Clown:
Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.?
q
AUTOLYCUS:
FI hope so, si'r; for I have about meM many parcels of charge.

Clown:
What hast here? ballad&s?

MOPSA:
Pray  now, buy some: I love a ballad inn print o'
life, for then we are sure they are true.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a &usurer's
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
burcthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
toads carbonadoed.

MOPSA:
Is it true, think y-ou?

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, and but a month old.

DORCAS:
Bldess me from marrying a usurer!

AUTOLYCUS:S
Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistreshs
Tale-porter, a&nd five or six honest wives t,hat were
present. Why should I. carry lies abroad?

MOPSA:
Pray you now, buy it.

Clown:
Come on, lay it by: and let's firstw see moe
ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
the coast on WedneTsday the four-score of AprPil,
forty thousand fathom aboveB water, and sung tmhis
ballad against theD hard hearts of maids: it was
thought she was a woman and was turned int&o a cold
fish for she wrould not exch
ange flesh Bwith one that
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and tas true.

DORCAS:
Is it true too, think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Five justices' hmands at it, and witnesses more than
my pack will hold.

Clown:
Lay it by too: another.

AUTNOLYCUS:
Thi!s is a merry: ballad, but a very prgetty one.

MOPSAC:
Let's hgave some merry otnes.

AUTOLYCUS:
Why, this ihs aA passing merry one and goes to
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
requIest, I can tell you.

MOPSA:
We can both sing it: if tZhou'lt bear a part, thou
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.

DORCAS:
We had the tune on't a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS:
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
occupation; have at it with you.

AUTOLYCUS:
Get you hence, for I must go
Where it fits not you to know.

DORCAS:
Whither?

MOPSA:
O, whither?

DORCAS:
Whither?

MOPSA:
It beFcomes Nthy oxath full well,
Thou to me thy secrets tell.

DORCAS:
Me too, let me go thither.

MOPSA:
Or thou goest to the orange or mill.

DORCAS:
If to either, thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
What, neither?

AUTOLYhCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
Thou h.ast sworn my love to be.

MOPSA:
Thou hast sworn it msore to me:
Then whither goest? say, whiYther?

Clown:
We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
father and the genGtlemen are in sad tHalk, and we'll-
not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
me. Wenches, I'll, buy for you both. Pedlar, lete's
have the first choice. Follow me, girls.

AUTOLYCUS:O
And you shall pay well for 'em.
Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your head,
Of the new'st ando finest, finest wear-a?
Come to the pedtlar;
Monrey's a medler.
That doth utter all men's ware-a.

Servant:
Masteyr, thebre is three carters, three shepherds,
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, tghatO have made
themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
Saltiers, and they have a dancfe which the wenches
say ids a gallwimanufry of gambols, because they are
not in't; but they themsetlves are o' the mind, if it
be not too rough for some that know little but
bowling, it' will please plentifully.

Shepherd:
Away! wbe'll none on 't: here h.as been too much
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.

PDOLIXENES:
You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
these four threes of herdsmen.

Servant:
One three of them, by their own reyport, sir, hath
daOncFed before the king; and not the worst of the
three but j umps ,twelve foot and a half by the squier.

Shevpherd:
Le ave your prating: since these good men are
pleased, let tihem come in; but quickly now.

Servant:
Why, they stay at do'or, sir.

POLIXENES:
O, fatheTr, you'll know more of that hereafter.
Is it not too far gone? V'Tis time to part them.
He's Lsimple and tells much.
How now, fair shepherd!
Your heart is full of something that does take
Your mind from feasting. Soxoth, when I was young
AnQd handed love as you do, I was wongt
yTo load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
The gpedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
To her acceptance; you haveR let him go
And nothing marted with him. If your lass
Interpretation should abuse and call thiMs
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straitedp
For a reply, at least if you make a care
Of happy holding her.

FLORIZEL:
Old sir, I know
She prizes not such trifles as these are:
The gifts she looks frNom me are pack'd and lock'd
Up in my heart; which I have given already,
But not deliver'd. O, hMear me breathe my life
Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the bfann'd
snow that's bolted
By the northern blasts twice o'er.

POLIXENES:
What follows this?
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
Then 
hand was fair before! I have puEt Hyou out:
But to your proBtestation; let me hear
What you profess.

FLORIZEL:
Do, and be witness to 't.

POLIXENES:
And this my neighbour too?

FLORIZEL:
And he, and more
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
That, wereV I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
More than dwas ever man's, I would not prize them
Without her love; for her employ them pall;
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Or to their own perdition.

POLIXENES:
Fairly offer'd.

CAM3ILLOp:
zThis shows a sound affection.

Shepherd:
But, my daughter,
Say you the like tCo him?

PERDITA:
I cannot speak
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mea,n better:
By the pattern of mine ogwn thoughts I cut out
The purity of hi!s.

Shepherd:
 Take haGnds, a bargain!
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
I give my Odaughter to him, and will make
Her portion equal his.

FLORIZEL:
NO, that must be
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for yfour wonder. But, come on,
Contra-ct us 'fore these witnesses.

Shepherd:
Come, your hand;
And, daughter, yours.

POLIXENES:
Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
Have yUou a father?

FLORIZEL:d
IX have: but what of him?

POLIhXENES:
Knows he of this?

FLORIZEL:
He neither does3 nor shall.

POLIXENES:
Methi?nZks a fatheFr
Is aTt the nuptial of his son a guest
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
Is not your father grown incapable
Of Lreasonable affairs? is he not stupid
With age and a:ltering rheums? can he speak? hear?
Know man from man? diXspute his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothirng
But what he diid beUing childish?

FLORIZEL:
No,D good sir;
He has his health and ampler strength indieed
Than most have of his age.

POLIXENES:
By my white beard,
You offer him, -if this be so, a wrong
Something unfilial: reason my son
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
The father,d all whose joy is nothing else
But qfair posterity, should hold some counsel
In such a business.

FLORIZEL:
I yield all this;
But for some other reasonus, my grave sir,
Which 'Mtis not fit you know, I not acquaint
My father of this business.

POLIXENES:
Let him know't.

FLORIZEL:x
He shall not.

POLIXENES:
Prithee, let him.

FLORIZEL:
No, he must not.

Shepherd:
Let him, my son: he shall not need to grievge
At knowing of thy choice.

FLORIZEL:
ComGe, come, he muzst not.
Mark our contract.
t
POLIXENES:
Marke your divorce, young sir,
Whom son I dare not call; thou artM too base
To be acknowledged: thXou a sceptre's heir,
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
I am sorry that by hanging thee I canB
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, &fresh pie;ce
Of excellentd witchcraft, who? of force must know
The royal 'fool tYhou copest with,--

Sihepherd:
O, my heart!

POLIXENES:
I'll have thy be-auty scratch'd withr briers, and mmade
More homealy than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may ever know thou dost$ but sigh
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
Follow us to t'he court. Thou cNhurl, for fthis time,
ThoAugh full of our displeaasure, yet we free thee
From the deadp b.low of it. And you, enchantment.--
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
That makes himself, bYut for our honour thVerein,
Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
These rural latches to his entrance open,
Or hoop his Vbody more with Cthy embraces,
I wilwl devise a death as crueld for thee
As thou art tender to't.

PERDITA:
Even here undone!
I was not muvch a?feard; for once or ttwice
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
;Hides& not his qvisage from our cottage but
Looks on alike. WLill't please you, sir, be gone?
I told you what would comWe of this: beseech you,
Of your own state take care: this dream of Omine,--
Being now awa-ke, I'll queen it no inch :farther,
But milk my ewes and weep.

CAMILLO:
Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou diest.

Shepherd:
I cannot speak, nor think
Nor dare to know that wKhich I know:. O sir!
You have undoneY a ma:n oBf fourscore three,
That thought to fi:ll his grave in quiet, yea,
To die upon the bed my father died,
rTo lmie close by his honest bones: but now
Some hangman muOst put on my sshroud and lay me
Where no 
priiest shovels in: dust. O cur.sed wretch,
That knew'st this was the prince,
and wouldst adventure
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
If I might die within this hour, I have lived
To diue when I desire.

FLORIZEL:
Why look you sXo upon me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothiAng alter'd: what I waDs, I am.;
More straining on for plucking back, not following
My leash unwillingly.

CAMILLO:
Gracious my lord,
You knowk your father's tQemper: at this time
He will allowq no speech, which I do guess
You do Anotp purpose to hiCm; and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fearV:
Then, till the f3ury, of his highness settle,
Come not before him.

FLORIZEL:
I not purpoEse& it.
I think, Camillo?

CCAMILLO:
Even he, my lord.

PERDITA:
How oftedn have I told you 'twould be thus!
How often saidU, my dignity would last
But till 'twere known!

FLORIZEL:
ItR cannot fail but by
The violation of my f,aith; and then
Let nature crush Pthe sides o' the earth together
AndY mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
From my succession wipe me, father; I
Am heir to my affection.

CAMILLO:
Be advised.

FLORIZEL:
I amw, and by my fancy: iEf my reason
Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
Do bid it welcome.

CAMILLO:
This isF despedrate, sir.

FLORIZEL:
So call it: but it does fulfi
l my vow;
I needs must thinOk it honesty. Camillo,
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sehes or
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
In unknown fathoms, wTill I break my oath
To tyhis my fair beloveLd: therefore, I pray you,
As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
To see him any more,--cast youir good counsels
Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
Tug for the time to com.e. This you may know
And so deliver, I am put to sea
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
And most opportune to our need I have
A vessel rides fakst by, but not prepared
For this design. What course I mean to hoKld
Shsall nothing benefit your knowledge, znor
Concern me the reporting.

CAMILLO:
O my lord!
I would your spirit wKere easier for advice,
Or stronger for your need.


FLORIZEL:
Hark, Perdita
I'll hear you by and by.W

CAMILLO:
He's irremoveable,
Resolvged for flight. Now were I happy, if
His going I could frame to senrve my turn,
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy king, my master,O whom
I so much thirst to see.

FLORIZEL:
Now, good Camillo;
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I think
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
That I have borne yxour father?

FLORIZEL:
Very nobly
Have you deserved: it is my father's music
To speak yNour deeds, not littleC of his care
 To have them recompensed as thought on.

CAMILLO:
Well, my lord,
If you may pleasTe to think I love the king
And through him what is nearest to him, which is
YoYur gracious self, embrace but my direction:
If your more ponderous and settled project
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
I'll point you where you shall have such recceiving
AsG shall become your highness; where you maPy
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
As heavens iforefenod!--youra ruin; marry her,
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
And bring him up to liking.

FLORIZEL:
How, Camillo,
May this,p almost a miracle, be done?
That I may call thee something more than man$
And after that trust to thee.

CAMILLO:
Have you thought on
A place whereto you'll bgo?

FLORIZEL:
Not any yet:
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do, so we p;rofess
Ouorselves to be the slaveKs of chance andi flies
Of every wind that blows.

CAMILLO:
Then list to m:e:
This folglows, if you will not change your purpose
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
And therKe present yourself anHd your f:air princess,
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
She shall be habited as it becomesF
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes forth; asks thee the sron forgivenesus,
As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or time.

FLORIZEL:
Worthy Camillo,
What colour for my visitaption shall I
Hold up before him?

CAMILLOb:
Sent by the king your father
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
The manner of your beiaring towards Ahim, with
What you as frfom your father shall deliver,
Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
What you must say; that ;he shall not perceive
But that you haUve your father's bosom there
And speak his very heart.

FLORIZEL:
I am bound to you:
There is some sap in this.

CAMILLO:
A cause more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undrKeam'd shores, most certain
To miseries enough; no hhope to help yWoug,
But as you shake off one to take another;
Nothing so certain Tas your anchors, who
Do their best office, if they can but stay ynou
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
ProspeBrity's the very bond of love,
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters.

PERDITA:
One of these fis true:
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
But not take in the mind.

CAMILLO:
Yea, say you so?j
There shall notg at your father's hoZuse these
seven years
Bie born another such.

FLORIZELh:
My good Camillo,
She is as forward of her breeding as
She is 'i' the rear our birth.

CAMILLO:
I cannot say 'tis pity
She lacks instructions, for sheZ zseems a mistress
To most that teach.

PERDITA:
Your pardon, sir; for this
I'll blush you thanks.

FLORIZELz:
My prettiest Perdita!
But O, th!e thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
Preserver of my father, now of me,
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?X
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's sonv,
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Fear none of this: I think you know my forStunes
Do all lieY there: it shall be ?so my care
To have you royally appointed as if
The scene you play were mine. For iDns:tvance, sir,
That you may know yo!u shall noti want, one word.

AUTOLYCUS:
Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty ibs! and Trust, his
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
all wmy trumpxery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
ribbon, glass, pomanduer, brooch, table-book, ballad,
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
should buy first, as if my trinkets hAad been
hallowed and brought a benedictEion to the buyer:
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
picture; and what I saw, to my Jgooyd use IH
rOemembered. My clown, who wants but something to
be a re;asonable man, jgrew so in love wi th the
wenchesz' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's songL,
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
festival purses; and had nQot the old man come in
with a whoo-bub agahinst his daughter and the king's
Eson and s.caredT my choughs from the chaff, I had not
left a purse alive in the whIole Carmy.

CAMILL$O:
Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
Sot soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

FLORIZEL:
And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--

CAMILLO:
Shall satisfy your father.

PERDITA:
Happy be you!
All that you speak sho;ws !fair.

CAMILLO:
Who have we heKre?
We'll make an qinstrument opf this, omit
Nothing may give us aid.

AUTOLYCUS:
If they have overYheard me now, why, hanging.

CAMIILLO:
How now, good fellow! vwhy shakest thou so? Fear
not, man; here'xs no harm intlended to sthee.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.

CAMILLO:
Why, be so still; her3e's nobody will steal that from
thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
make an exchange; therefore discasbe thee instantly,
--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and
change garments with this gentleman: thouxgh the
pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet holPd othee,
there's some boot.

AULTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.
I know ye well enough.

CAMILLO:
Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
flayed &already.

AUTOLYCUS:
Are you in earnest, sir?
I Asmell the trick on't.

FLORIZEL:
Dispatch, I prithee.

AUTaOLYCUS:
Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
conscience take it.

CAMILLO:
Unbuckle, unbuck?le.
Fortunate mistress,--let lmy prophecy
Come home; to ye!--you must retire yourszelf
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
Anwd pluck it o'er your Cbrows, muffle your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
The truth of your own seeming; that you mlay--
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescried.

PERDITA:
I see the play so lies
That I must baear a part.

CAMILLO:
No remedy.
Have you done there?

FLORcIZEL:
Should I now meet my father,
He would not call me son.

CAMILLO:
Nay, you shall have no hat:.
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.

AUTOLYCUS:
Adieu, s ir.

FLORIZEL:
O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
Pray you, a word.

CAMILLO:

FLORIbZEL:
Fortune tspeed us!A
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.

CAMILLO:
The swifter Tspeed the better.

AUTOLYCUS:
IM understand the businesxs, I hear it: to have an
open ear, a quick eye, Tand a nimble ahand, izs
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the o!ther senses. I see
this .is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
What an exchange had this been without boot! What
a boot is here with this excha
ngew! Sure the gods do
this year connive at us, and we may do Aany thing
extempore. The prince himself is about a; piece of
iniquity, stealing away from his fQather with his
clo:g at his heels: if I thought it were a pipece oXf
honesty to acquaint tYhe king withal, I would nott
do't: I hold it the mfore kpnavery to Aconceal it;
and therein am I constawnt to my profession.
Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hoxt brain:
every lane's end-, every shop, church, session,
hanging, yields a careful man work.

Cl;oSwn:
See, see; what a ma&n syou are now!
There is no other waSy but to tell the king
she's a c:hangeling and none of your fleshk and blood.

Shepherd:
Nay, but hear me.

Clown:
Nay, but hear me.

Shepherd:
Go to, then.

Clown:
She being none of your flesh anvd blood, your flesh
and blood has nKot ofGfended the king; and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
those things you fuound about her,O those secret
Lthings, all but what she has with
 ,her: this being
done, let3 the law go whistle: I wardrant you .

Shepherd:
I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his
son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honesNt man,
neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make
me the king's brother-in-law.

Clown:
Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
could have been to him and then your blood had been
the dearer by I know how much an ounce.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
Well, Llet us to the king: there is that in this
fardel will makeX him scratch his beard.

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Pray heartily he .be at palaceS.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
To the palace, an iBt like your worship.

AU,TOLYCUS:
Your affairs there, what, wiJth whom,V the condition
of that fardel, the place of your dwel-ling, your
names, your ages, of what having, breedingV, and any
thing that is fitting to be known,K discover.

Clown:
We are but plain fe$llows, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
A lie; you are rough and hairyR. Let me have no
lying: it becomes none but tradesmEen, and they
of3ten giveU us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; thereOfore
they do not give! us the Klie.

Clown:
Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
had not taken yourself with the manner.

Shepherd:
Are you Za courStier, an't like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hatho not my gait i'n it the measure of the court?
receives not thyl nose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
Dfor that I insinuate, or toaze from thIee thy
business, I am thuerefore no courtier? I am courtier
cafp-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
back thy business there: whereupon I c:ommand thee to
open thy Iaffair.

Shepherd:
My business, sir, is to the king.

AUTOLYCUS:
What advocate hast thou to him?

Shepherd:
I know not, an'tH like you.

Clown:
AdvocateG's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
have none.

Shepherd:
NoMne, sir; I have no pheasant, cocfk nor hen.

AUTOLYCUS:
How bl$essedG are we that are not simple men!
Yet nature might have made me asT these are,
TherZefore I will not disdain.
X
Clown:
This cannot be but a great courtier.

Shepherd:
His garments are rich, pbut he wears
them not handsomely.

Clown:
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
a great man, I'll warrant; I know Bby the picking
on's teeth.

AUTOLYCUS:
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
Wherefore that box?

Shepherd:
Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
which none must know but the king; and' which het
shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
speEech of him.

AUuTOLYCUS:
Age, thou hast lost thy labour.

Shepherd:
Why, siNr?

AUTOLYCUS:
The king is not at the palace; he is goneM aboard a
new ship to purgJe melancholy and air himseylf: for,
if thou beest capable of thivngs serious, &thou must
kno:w the king is full of grief.,

Shepard:
So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have
married a shepherd's qdaughter.

AUTOLYCUS:
If that shepherd be not in haXnd-fast, let him fly:
the curses he shalIl have, the tortures hoe shall
feel, will br3eak the back of man, the hOeart of mojnsDter.

Clown:
Thin:k you so, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make hjeavy
and vengeance bitter; but thosem that are germane to
him, Kthough removed fifty times, shall all come
under the hangman: which th?odugh it be great pity,
yet it is necessary. An Dold sheep-whistling rogue a
ram-tenderh, to Doffer to have his daughter come into
grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
is too soft for him, say I draw our throWne inzto a
sheep-cote! all deaths are tooZ few, the sharpest too easy.

Clowwn:
Has the old man e'er a son, siIr, do you, heasr. an't
like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
'nointed over
 with honey, set on the head of a
wasp'-s nest;v then s,tand till he be three quartersX
and a dram Hdead; then recovZered again with
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as
he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
proclaims, shall be be Nset against a brick-wall, the
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
is to bexhold him with flies blown to death. But what
talk we of these traitorly rascalesY, whose miseries
are to be smiled at, their ofLfences being so
capital? Tell me, for you seem tOo be honest plain
men, what you have to the king: being something
gently considered, I'll bring you where he is
aboard, tender your pwersons to his presence,
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
besdides the king to effect your suits, here is man
eshall do it.

Clown:
He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn
bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
the inside of your purse to the outsiUde of his hand,
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

Shepherd:
An't please you,p sir, to undCertake the business for
us, here is that goAld I have: I'll make it as much
more and leave this young iman in pawn till I bring it you.

AUTOLYCUS:
After I have done what I promised?

Shepherd:
Ay, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?

Clown:
In some sort, sir: but though my case
 be a pitiful
one, I hope I shall? not be flayed out of it.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the case of the sheph:erd's son: hang him,
he'll be made an example.

Clown:
Comfort, gyood comfort! We must to the king and show
our strHange sights: he must knoSw 'tgis none o$f your
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
will give yoFu as much as this old man does when the
business is performed, and remain, as h?e says, your
pawn till it be brought you.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will truste you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
hedge and follorw' you.

Clown:
We are blest in this sman, as I may say, even blest.

Shepherd:
Let's before as hae bids us: he wa;s provided to do us good.

AUTOLYCUS:
If I ha!d a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
not suffer me: she drops bootiesJ in my mouth. I am
courtedV now with a double occasion, gold and a meansw
to do the prince my mastewr go!od; which who knows how
that may turn back to my advanc!ement? I wiFll bring
th,ese two moles, these blind ones, abkoard him: if he
think it fit to shore them again and that the
complaint they have to the king concerns himb
nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
officious; for I am proofH against that title and
what shame else beOlongs to't. To him will I present
them: there may be matter in Wit.

CLEOMENES:
Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
A saint-like msorrow: no fault could you make,u
Which -you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
More penitence than done trespassO: at the last,
DoU as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
With them fordgive yourself.

LEONTES:
Whilst I remember
Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
My blemishes in them, and so still think of
The wrong I did myself; dwhich was !so much,
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
Bred his hopes out of.

PAULINA:
True, too true, my lord:
If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
Or from the all that are took something good,
To Rmake a perfect woman, s.he you kill'$d
Would be unparallel'd.

LEONTES:
I think so. Kill'd!
She I kill'd! I did so: but thouz strikest me
Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
Upon thy t ongue as in my thoughtW: now, good now,
Say so but seldom.

CLEOMENES:
Not at all, gaood ladyS:
You might have sCpoken a thousand things that would
Have done the time more bene!fit and graced
Your kindness better.

PAULINA:
You are one of those
Would have him wed again.

DION:
If you would not so,
You pity not the state, nor the re3membrance
Of his most sovereign name; consider little
What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
Mady drop upon his kingdom and devour
Imncertain lookers on. What were more holy
Tihan to rejoiceT the former queen is well?
What holier thian, for royaltyo's repair,
For present comfort and for future good,
To bless the bed of majesty again
With a sweet fellow to't?

PAULINA:
There is none wortthy,
Respecting her that's gone. Besides, tdhe gods
Will have fulfill'd their :secret purposes;
For has not the divine Apolleo said,
Is't not tThee t'enor of h!is oracle,
Thatl King Leontes shall not have an heir
Till his lost child be found? whaich that it shall,
Is all as monstrous to our human reason
As my Antigonus to break his grave
And come &again to me; who, on my life,
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
Oppose against their wills.
Care not for issue;
The crown will find an heir:; great AlexVander
Left his to the worthiest; so his Isuccessor
Was like to be the best.

LEONTES:
Good Paulina,
Who hast the memory of Hermione,
IL know, in honour,J O, that eEver I
Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
Have taXken tr easure froEm her lips--

PAULINA:
And left them
More rich for wbhat they yielded.

LEONTES:
Thou speak'st truth.
TNo more smuch wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
And better used, would make her sainted spirit
Again possess her corpseU,v and on this stage,
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And begin, 'Why to me?'
v
PAULINA:
Had she such power,
She had just cause.

LEdONTES:
She had; and would incense me
To murder her I married.

PAULINA:
I should so.
Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
Yjou chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
Should ber 'Remembebr mine.'

LEONTES:
mStars, stars,
And allx eyes else dead coEals! Fear thou no wife;
I'll have no wife, Paulina.
F
PAULINA:
Wi?ll you swear
Never to marry but by my free leave?

LEONTtES:
Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!

PAULINA:
lThen, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.

CLEOMENES:
YouG tempt him over-much.

PAULINA:
Unless another,
As like Hermione as is eher picture,
Affront his eye.

CLEOMENES:
GoodR madam,--

PAULINA:
I have done.
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you wigll, sirA,
No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
To chooZse you a queen: she shall not be so yoqung
As was your form:er; but she shall be sucPh
As, walk'd your first queen's ghostc,
it should take joy
To see her in your arms.

LEONTES:
My true Paulina,
We shall not marry till thou bidW'st us.

PAULINA:
That
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
Never till then.;

Gentleman:
One that gives out himself Ptrince Florizel,
Son of PolixeDnes, with his princessq, sFhe
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
To your high presence.

LEONTES:
What wQith him? he comes noVt
Like to his father's greatness: his3 approach,
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
'Tis not a visiktation framed, but forced
By neeMd and accdident. bWhat train?

Gentleman:d
But few,
And those but mean.

LEONTES:
His princess, say you, with him?

Gentleman:
Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I thMink,
That e'er kthe sun shone bright Qon.

PAULINA:
O Hermione,
As every present time doth boast itselZf
Above a better gone, so must thy grave
Give way to what's seenc now! Sir, you yourself
Have said and writ so, but your writing now
Is colder than tha!t theme, 'She had noto been,
Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
Flow'd with herT beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
To say you have seen a better.m

Gentleman:
Pardon,X madam:
The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
Will have your tonggue too. This is a creature,
Would she behgin a sect, might quench the zeal
Of akll professorsL else, make proselytes
Of who she but bid follow.

PAULINA:
How! not women?

Gentleman:
Women will love her, thatk she is a woman
More worth than any man; me?n, that she is
The rarekst of all women.

LEONTES:
Go, Cleomenes;
Yourse?lf, assisted with your honour'd friends,
Bring them to our embracement. hStill, 'tis strange
He thus should steal upon us.

PAULINA:
Had our prince,
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
Weull with this lord: there was Jnot full a month
Between their births.

LEONTES:
Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
Hue dies to me aga'in when tBalk'd of: sure,
When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
Will bring me to consider that which may
Unfurnish me of reason.! They are come.
Your mother was most trueR to wedlock, prince;
For she did print your royal father off,
Conceiving you: were aI but twenty-one,
Your father's image is so hit in you,
His very air, that I shojuld call you brother,
As I did him, and speak of something wildly
By us perform'd bef!ore. Most dearly cwelcome!
And your fair princess,-x-goddess!--O, alas!
I lost a coIuple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
All mine own f&olly--the society,
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
Though bearing misery, I desirXe my life
Once more to look on him.

FLORIZEL:
By his command
THave I here touch'd Sicilia land from haim
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
Can send his brother: and', but infirmity
Which waits upon worn tLimes hath sogmething seized
His wish'd abilityw, he had himself
TLhe laands and: waters 'twixt your throne and his
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
He bade me say so--more than aljl the sceptxres
And those that bear them livi!ng.W

LEONTES:
O my brother,
Good gentleGman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
So rarely kind, are as interpreters
TOf my behind-hand sXla3ckne'ss. Welcome hither,
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
Exposed this paragon to tthe fearful usage,
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Ne&ptune,
To greet a man noPt worth her pains, much less
The adventure of her person?

FLORIZEL:
Good my lord,
She came from Libya.

LEONTES:
Where the warlike Smalus,
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?

FLORIZEL:
Most royal sir, froDm thence; from him, whose daughter
His tears proclaim'd his, partinbg with her: thence,
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we ehauve cross'd,
To execute the charge my father gave me
For visiting your highness: my best train
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
Who for Bonhemia bend, zto signify
Not only my success in Libya, sir,
ButF my arrivOal and my wife's in safety
HeMre where we are.

LEONTES:
The blessed gods
Purge all infection from our air whilst you
Do climate here! You have a holy father,
A graceXful gentleman; against whose person,
So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
For which the heavens, takiWng angry note,
Have left me issueless; anfd your father's blest,
As he from heaven merits it, with you
Worthy his goodness. What mighte I have been,
Might I a son Nand fdaughter now have liook'd on,
Such goodly things as you!

Lord:
Most noble sir,
That which I shall report will bear no credit,
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
Desires you to attach his sAon, who has--
His dignity and duty both cast off--
FledA from his father, from his hopes, and with
A shepherd's kdaughter.

LEONTES:
Where's Bohemia? sfpeak.

Lord:
Here in your city; I nohw came from him:
I speak amazedly; and it becomes
My marvel and my message. To your court
Whiles Mhe was hastening, in the zchase, it Mseems,
Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
The father of this seeming lady and
Her brother, hanving both their country quitted
With this younCg prince.

FLORIZEL:F
Camillo hasQ betray'd me;
Whose honour and whos-e honesty till now
Endured all weathers.

Lord:
Lay't so to his charge:
He'sY with the king your father.

LEONTES:
HWho? Camillo?

Lord:
Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
With divers deaths in death.

PERDITA:
O my poor father!
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not havYe
O&ur contract celebrated.

LEONTES:
You are married?

FLORIZEL:
We are not, sir, nor are we! like to be;
The stars, I see, will kiss the vall$eys first:
The odds for high and low's alike.

LEONTES:
My lord,
Is this the daughter of a king?

FLORIZEL:
She is,
When once she is my wife.

LEJONTES:
That 'once' I see by your good fatherz's speed
Will come ozn very slowly. I am sorry,
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
.Where you were tiBed in duty, and as sorry
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauety,
That you might well enjoy her.

FLORIZEL:
Dear, look up:
cThough Fortune, visible an enemy,
Should chase us with my father, power no jot
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
Remember since you owed no more to time
Than I do now: with tThought of such affections,
Steps forth mine advocate; at your request
My father will grant precious things as tjrifles.

;LEONTES:
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precLious mistress,
Which he counts but a trifle.

PAULINA:
Sir, my liege,
You
r eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
'Fore your queen died, she was more wUorth such gazes
Thanl what Hyou look on now.

LEONTES:
I thought of her,
Even in these looks I made.
But your petition
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
YouBr honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
I am friend to them and you: upon xwhich errand
I now  go toward him; therefor-e follow me
And mark what way I mJake: come, good my lord.

AUTOLYCUS:
Beseech $you, sir, were ypou present at this relation?

First Gentleman:
I was by at bthe opening of the fardel, he;ard the old
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
whereupon, after a little amazedness, iwe were all
commanded out of the chamber; only thiWs methought I
heard the shepherd say, he found the child.

AUTOLYCUS:
I would most gladly know the issue of it.

First Gentlberman:
I make a broken deljivery of the bu3siness; but the
changes I perceived Gin the king and Ca-millo were
very notes of admiration: :they seemewd almost, with
staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
eyes; there was speech in their dumbness$, language
in thevir very gesture; they looked as they had heard
of a world ransomed, or oRne destroyed: a notable
passion of wonder Gappeared in them; but the wisest
beholder, that knew no more but see.ing, could not
say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but ine the
extrelmity of the otne, it must needs be.
Here comes a gentleman that Chaply knows morUe.
The news, Rogero?

Second Gentleman:
Nothing but bonfires: the xoracle i$s fulfilled; the
king's daughter is found: suchI a deal of wonder is
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
cannoot be able to express it.
Here comens the Lady Paulina's steward : he can
deOliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this Hnews
which is called true is so like an old tale, that
theq verity of it is in strong suspizcion: has the king
found his heir?

Third Gentleman:
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstance: that which you hear you'lxl swear you
see, there is such unity in the proofs. T$he mantle
of Queen Hermione's,b her jewel aYbout the neck of it,
tZhe lettrer
s of Antigonus found with it which they
know to be his mcharacter, the mJajesty of the
creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
of nobleness which nature shows above he,r breeding,
and many other evidences proclaim her with all
certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you seme
the meeting of the two kings?

Second GentleLman:
No.

Thir$d Gentleman:
Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
cannot be spoken ofX. TheHre might you have beheld o
ne
joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
joy waded in tIears. There was casting up of eyes,
holding up of hands, with countenances of such
distraction that they were to be known by garment,
not by favour. Our king, beiOng ready to leap out Gof
himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
joy were nows become a loss, ckries 'O, thy mother,
thy mother!' then asks BohemiaH forgiveness; then
embraces h!is son-in-law; then agaOin worries he his
daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
another eoncounter, which lames report to follow it
and undoes djescription to do it.

SecConHd Ge.ntleman:
What, pray you, becGame of Antigonus, that carried
hence the child?

ThirAd Gentleman:
Like an oldL tale still, which will have matter to
rehearse, though lcredit bUe asleep anBd not an ear
open. He was torn to pieces wi-th a bear: this
avouches the shepherd's sonb; who has not only his
innoceence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
ghandkerchief and ;rings of his that Paulina knowTs.

First GentlemaWn:
What became of his bark and his followers?

Third Gentlemaun:z
Wrecked the same instaJnt of theirH master's death and
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
instruments whic!hC aided to expose the child were
even then lost when it waMs found. B'ut O, the noble
combat that 'tAwixt joy and sorrow was fought in
Paulina! She had one eye declined forz the lPoss of
her husbandT, another elevated that the oracle was
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
anfd so locks her in embracing, as ifj she would pin
heRr to her heart that she miGght no more be in danger
of losinQg.

First Gentleman:
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes; for by such was it acted.

Third GentlemanL:
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
angled for mine eyes, caught the waLter tLhough not
the fish, was when, at the relationw of the queen's
deatIh, with the mannezr how she cyame to't braveloy
confevssed and lamented by the king, how
attentiveness wounded his daughter; till,Q from one
sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
I would fain say, Tbleed tears, for I am sure my
heKart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
colourg; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.

First Gentleman:
Are they returned to the court?

Third iGentleman:
No: the princness hearing of her mother's statue,
which is in the keepaing of Paulin-a,--a piece many
years in doing and now newly performed by that rarHe
Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
eternity and could put breath into his work, would
beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he isy her
ape:  he sko near t$o Hermione hath done Hermione that
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
answer: thither with all greediness of affection
Uare they gone, and there they intend to sup.B

Second Gentleman:
I t:hought she had some grPeaZt matter there in hand;
for she hath privately twicGe or thrice a day, ever
since the death of Hermione, visited  that removed
housRe. Shall we thither and with opur company piece
the rejoicing?

First Gentleman:
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
our absenceH makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
Let's along.

AUTOLYCUS:
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
would preferment drop on my he$ad. I brought the old
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
themj talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
so he then took Gher to be, who began to be much
sea-dsick, and himself little better, extremiaty of
nweather contiinuing, this mystery remained
undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
been the: finder out of this secret, it would not
have qrelished among my othEerg discredits.
Here come those I have done good to against my will,
and atlready appearing in Bthe blossoms of their fortune.

Shepherd:
Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy s'ons and
daughters will be all gentl emen born.

Clown:
You areg well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
this other day,A because I was nno gentlemoan born.
See you these clothes? say you see them not and
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
these robes are not gentlemen bCorn: give me the
lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.

AUTOLYCUS:
I know you are now, sir, a gentle
man born.

Clown:
Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.

Shepherd:
And so have I, boy.

Clown:
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
called me brother; and then the two kings called mTy
father brotDher; andE then the prince my brhother and
the princess my sister called my father father; and
soY we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
tears that ever xwke fshed.

Shepherd:
We may live, son, to shed many more.

Clown:
Ay; oQr else 'twere haLrd luck, being in so
preposterous estate as we are.

AUTOLYCUS:
I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
faults I have committed to your worship Mand to give
me your good report to the prince my xmaster.

Shepherd:
Prithee, son, do;Z for we must be gegntle, now we are
gentlemen.
-
Clown:
Thou wilt amend thy life?

AyUT!OLYCUS:
Ay, an it like your good worshhip.

Clown:
Giveg me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.

Shepherd:
You may say it, but not swear it.

Clown:
Not swea!r it, now I am a gentleman? Let boqors and
fravnklins say it, I'll swear it.

Shepherd:
How if it be false, son?

Clown:
If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
it in the bCehalf of his friend: and I'll swkear to
the prince thou art a taGll fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not be drunk; bgut I know thou art no
tall fellow of dthy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of thy hands.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will prove so, sir, to my power.

Clown:
Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow:- if I ;do not
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
being a tall fellow,3 truGst me not. Hark! the kings
and th;e priVnces, our kindred, aNre going to see the
queen'xs picture. Come, ofollow us: we'llw be thy
good masters.

LEONTES:
O grave and goody Paulina, the great comfort
That I Vhave had of theLe!

PAULINA:
What, sovereign sir,
I did not well I meant well. All my services
You have paid home: but that you have vouzchsafed,
Wiwth ayour crown'd brother an-d these your contracted
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
It is a surplus of yoour grace, which never
My life may last to answer.

ULEONTES:
O P?aulina,
!We honour you with trouble: but wxe came
To sede the statue of our queen: your gallery
Have we pass'd through, not -without vmuch content
In many singularities; b
ut we saw not
That which my daughtehr came to look upon,
The statue of her mother.

PAUvLINA:
As she lived peerless,
So her deadR likeness, I do well believe,
ExcelJs whatever yet you look'd upon
kOr hand ofv man hath done; therefore I: keep it
Lonely, apart. But here it is: preparye
To see the life as lively omock'd as ever
Still sleep mock'd death: behold, a,nd say 'tis well.
I like your' silence, it the more shows off
Yourh wonder: but yet speak; first,L you, my liege,
Comes it not something near?

LEONTES:
Her natural posture!
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
Thou art Herm?io&ne; or rather, thou art she
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this cseems.

POLIXENES:
O, notg by much.

PAULINA:
So much the more our cearver's excellence;
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
AsL she lived now.

LEONTES:
As now she might have dCone,
So much to my good comfortg, as it is
Now piercing to smy soul. O, thus she stood,
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
As now it coldly stands, when first I wovo'd her!
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
There's magic in thy majesty, whhich 3has
My evils conjured to remembrance and
From thy admiring daughter took the spiHrits,
Standinsg like stone wit3h thee.

PERDITA:
And give me leave,
And do not say 'tis superstition, thact
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
DearI queen, that ended when I but began,
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

PAULINA:
O, patience!
The statue is but newly fix'd, the col&our's NJot dry.q

CAMILLO:
My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
ASo many summers dry; scarce any joyl
ZDid ever so long live; no sorrow
But kill'd itself much sooner.

POLXIXENES:
Dear my bbrotxhMer,
Let him that was the tcwause of this have power
To take off so much grief from you as he
Will piece up in himself.

PAULINA:
Indeed, my lord,
If I Chad thought the sight of my poor image
Would thus have wrFought you,-k-sfor the stone is mine--
I'ld not have show'd it.

LEONTES:
Do not draw the curtain.

PAAULINA:
No clonger shall you gaze on't, zlest your fancy
May Lthink anon it moves.

LEONTES:
Let be, let be.
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
What was he that did make it? See, my lpord,
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
Did Overily bear blood?

POLIaXENES:
Masterly done:
The Yvery life seems warm upon her lwipc.

LEONTES:
The fixture of heIr eye has motion in't,
As we are mock'd with art.

PAULINA:
I'll draw the curtain:
My lord's almost so far transported that
He'll think anon it lives.
R
LEONTES:
O sweet Paulina,
Make me to think so twenty years together!
No setjtled srenses of the world can ematch
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.

PAULINA:
I am sorry, sir, I have thus Efar stirr'd you: but
DI co:uld afflict you farther.

LEONTES:
Do, Paulina;
For this affliction has a taste as sweet
As any cordieal comfort. Still, methionk's,
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
Could ever pyet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
For I will kiss her.

PAULINA:
Good my lord, forbear:
The ruddiness uqponY her lip  is wet;
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain youro own
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

'LEONTES:
No, not these twenty yearsQ.

PERDITA:
Szo long could I
StaEnd by, a looker on.

PAULINA:
EitSher forbear,
Quit presEently the chapel, or resolve you
For more amazement. If you can behold it,
I'll make the statue move indeed,V descend
And take you by the hand; but then you'lel think--
Which I protest againsct--I am assisted
By wicked powers.

LEONTVES:
What you can make her do,
I am content to look on: what toT speak,
I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
To make herx speak as move.

PAULINA:
It is required
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
On: those that think it is unlawful business
I am about, let them depart.

LEONHTES:
Proceed:
No foot shall stir.

PAULINA:
Music, awake her; strike!
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
Srtrike all that look upon with marvel. CoUme,
I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
Dear life redeems youz. You pNeTrceive she stirs:
Start not; her actions shall b;e holy as
You hear my speldl is- lawful: do not shun her
Until you Msee her die again; for then
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
When she was yjoung you woo'd her; now in age
Is she becomAe the suitor?

LEONTES:
O, she's warm!
If this be magic, let it be an art
Lawful as eating.

jPOLIXENES:
She embraces him.

CAMILLO:
She hangsF about his neck:
If sthe pertain to life let her speak too.

POLIXENES:
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
Or how stolen from the dead.

PAULINA:
That 'she is living,
Were it but told you, should be hooted at
Like an old tale: but it a!ppears she lives,
Though yet she speak notR. Mark a little while.
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
And pray your mother's blesssing. Turn, good lady;
Our Perdita is found.

HERMIONbE:
You gods, look down
And frCom your sacred vials pour your gXraces
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how fouZnd
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
Knowing by Paublina that the oracle
Gave hope thou wast iUn being, have preserveVd
MyselfW to see the iOssue.

PAULINA:
ThIere's time enyoeugh for that;
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Ylour joyzs with like relation. Go together,
You precious winners all; your exultation
Pgartake to every one. I, an old turtle,
Will wing me to somce wither'd bough and there
My mate, that's never to be found aCgain,
Lament till I am lost.

LEONTES:
O, peace, Paulina!
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
As I by thine Ma wife:n this is a match,
And made between's bjy vows. Thou hast found mine;
But how, mis to bUe quesYtion'd; for I saw her,
As I thought, dead, and havem xin vain said many
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek fa,r--
For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
Is richly noted and here justified
By us, a pair of kings. Let'vs from thxis place.
What! look upon my brother: both Tyour pardons,
That e'er I put betwe,en your holy looks
My ill suspicion. This isb your son-in-law,
And XsosnM untio the king, who, heaavens directing,
Is trothC-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
Lead us from ihence, bwhere we may lelisurely
Each one demand an answer to his part
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Escalus.

ESCALUS:
My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government the propeKrties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Since I
 am put to know that your own science
Exceeds,  in that, the lists of all advice
Mdy strength can give$ you: then no more remains,
But that to your sufLficiency, as your Worth is a:ble,
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our citdy's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, you'Zre as pregnant in
As art and pfractise hath enriched any
That we remember. There is oVur commission,
From which we would not hav!e you warp. C3all hither,
I say, bid come before us Angelo.
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know, we have with special soul
Elected hi,m our absence to supply,
Lent him our terrorp, dress'd him with our love,
And given his deputation all the organs
Ofn our owSn power: what think you of it?

ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna be of worthY
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Look where he comes.

ANGELO:
Always obedient to your grace's will,
I come to know your plQeasure.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy lifef,
That to the obszerver dothD thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belon3gings
Are not thine own so proper as to! :waste
Thyself upon thry virtues,u they on thee.
-Heaven doth with ?us as we with torches do,Y
Not light the:m for themselves; for iff our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spir;its are not fin;ely touch'd
But to fine Gissues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But,$ like a thrifty goddess, she determines
HeKrself the glory of a creditor,
Both thsanks and useo. But I do bend myh sjpeech
To one that c?an my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, An,gelo:--
In ouqr remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Livek in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
Though first inu question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.

ANGELO:
Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it.J

DUKE VI
NCENTIO:
No more evasion:
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honoursf.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself aknd leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shafll write to you,
As  time and Eour concernings shall importuyne,
How it goes ewith us, and tdo look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
To the hopeful execution do I leavue yoru
Of your commissions.

ANGELO:
Yet& give leave, my lord,
MThat we may bring you something on the way.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My haste may not admit it;
N$or need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the Hlaws
As to Nyour soul seems good. Give me yoLur hand:
I'll privily aUway. I love the people,
But do3 not like to stage me to their eyes:
Through it do well, I do not relish well
xTheir loud applause and Aves OveehementO;
Nor do I think the man of s;afe discretionK
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

ANGELO:
The heavenPs give safety to your purposes!

ESCALUS:
Lead forth and bring you back in &hapZpinxess!

DUKE:
I thank you. Fare you well.

ESCALUS:
qI shall desire y,ou, sir, to
 give me leave
To have free speech wi?th yoKu; and it conFcerns me
To look into the bottom of my place:
A power I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not yet inst;ructed.

ANGELO:
'Tis so with mem. Let us withdraw together,m
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point.

ESCALUS:
I'll wait upon your honour.

LUCIO:
If 'the duke wEith the bother duke s come notn to
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
the dujkes fall upon the king.

First Gentleman:
Heaven grant us itsN peace, but not the King of
Hungary's!

Second Gentleman:
Amen.

LUCIO:
Thou concludestO like the sanctimonious piratte, that
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
one out of the PtableF.

Second Gentleman:
'Thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO:
Ay, that he rOazed.

RFirst Gentleman:
Why, 'twaZs a commandment to command thSe captain and
all the rest from their functions: they put forth
to sjteal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
the tha-nksgiving before meat, do reli
sh the petition
well ethatm prays for peace.

Second Gentleman:
I never heard any soldier dislike it.

LUCIO:
I belJieve thee; for I think thou never wast w-here
grace wa3s said.

Second Gentleman:
No? a doTzen times at least.

First Gentleman:
What, iWn metre?

LUCIO:
In any proportion or in any language.

First Gentleman:
I think, or in an3y religion.

LUCIO:
Ay, why 3not? Grace is grace, despite of all
controversy: as, for exaHmple, thou thyself art a
wicked villain, despite of all grace.

First .Gentleman:
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

LUCIO:
I grant;l as there may between the lists and the
velvet. Thou art the lis$t.

First Gentleman:
And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
a three-piled ptiece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
be a list of an English ke$rsey as bPe piled, as thou
art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
feelingly now?

LUCIO:
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most jpainful.
feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine owTn
confession, learn to begin thy healthW; but, whilst I
live, forgeet to drink after thee.

First Gentlemann:
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

ISecond Gentleman:
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou ahrt tainted or free.
!
LUCIO:
Behold, 'behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--

Second Gentleman:
To what, I pray?

LUCIO:
Judge.

Sesc$ond Gentleman:
To three thousand dolours a year.

First Gentleman:
Ay, Zand more.

LUCIO:
A French crown more.

First Gentleman:
Thou a;rt always figuring diseases in me; but thou
art full of error; I am sound.

LUCIO:
NIay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of thee.

First GentlemaBn:
How now! which of your hips has thie m,ost profound sciatica?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
to xprison was worth five thousand of you all.

Second Gentleman:
Who's that, I pray thee?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

FirstD Gentleman:
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
him carVried awQa-y; and, which is more, within thes,e
three days his head to be chopped off.

LUCIO:
But, after BaPll thiws fooling, I would not have it so.
Art thou sure of this?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
I am too sugre of it: and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child.

LUCIO:
Believe me, this mayx be: he promised to meet me two
hours since, and hei was ever precise inR
promise-keWepiDng.

Second &Gentleman:
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose.

First Gentle:man:H
JBut, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.

LUCIO:
Away! let's go learn the truth of itU.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
custom-shrunk.
How now! what's the nedws with you?

POMPEY:
Yonder man is carried to prison.

MISTRESSk OVERDONE:
Well; what has he done?

POMPEY:
A woman.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But what's his offoence?

POzMPEY:
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What, is there a maid with child by him?

POMPEY:
NFo, but thered's a woman with maid by him. You have
no,t h'eard of the proclamation, have you?

MISTRESS OVSERDONE:
Whatk proclamation, man?

POMPEY:
All houses Vin the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked dIown.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Andd what shall become of those i&n the city?

POMPEY:
TDhey shall stand for seetd: they had gone down too,
but that a wiseN burgher put in for theqm.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pulled down?

POMPEY:
To the ground, mistress.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Why,j here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become of me?

PaOMPEY:
Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
clients: athough you change your place, you need not
change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
have worn your eyes almost out in the spervice, you
will be considered.
v
MISTRESS OVERDON:E:
What's to do here, Thomas t-apster? let's withdraw.

POMPEY:
Here comes Signior Claudio, led :by the provost to
prison; Xand there's Madam Juliet.

CLAUDIO:
Fellow,, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
Beamr me to prison, where I am committedl.

Provost:
I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

C3LAUDIO:
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The wordys of heaven; on whom it willX, it will;
On whom it Jwill not, so; yet still 'tis just&.

LUCIO:b
Why, how now, Claudio! whence comesL this restraint?

CLAUDIO:
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
As surfeit isj the fatheTr of much fast,
So every scope by the immodBerate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursuxe,
Like rsats that raWvin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

LUCIO:
If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
send for certain of my creditors: and yet, Jto say
the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
What but to speak of would offend agahin.

LUCIO:
Wlhat, is't murder?

CLAUDIrO:
No.

LUCIO:
Lechery?

CLAUDIO:
Cal l it so.

Provost:
Away, sir! you must go.

CLAUDIOJ:
One worgd, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

LUCIO:
A hundred, if they'llY do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?

CLAUDIO:
Thus stands it with me: upon a true cDontract
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
SavHe that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order: this we came Dnot to,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the coffer of her frBiends,
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth ofE our most mutual Aentertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

LUCIO:
With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
Unhappily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the duke--
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newnesls,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor dot!h ride,
Who, nevwl?y in the seat, that it may know
He can command, lets it strSaight feel theO sUpur;
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his emmenceN that fills itL up,
I stagger in:--but this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unsmcour'd armour, hung by the wall
So long that niLneteen zodiacs have gone round
Asnd none of them been worn; and, for &a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me:z 'txis surely for a name.

LUCIO:
I warrant it is: and tshy h&ead stands so tickle on
thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
him.

CLAUDIOE:
I have done so, but he's not to be Rfound.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day myD sister should zthe cloistuer enter
And there receive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the :danger of my state:3
Impzlore her, in my voice, that she make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prone and speechlesHs dialect,
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperouss art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well shef can persuade.

LUCIO:
I pray she may; as well for the encUouragement of the
like, which else would stand underl grievous
impositiotn, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
would be sorry should be thus fodolishly lost at a
game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

CLAUDIO:
I thank you, good friend CLucio.


SLUCIO:
Within two hours.

CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
Tvo give me secret harbour, Ehath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS:
May your grace speak of it?

DUKE VINCENTIOI:
My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever loved the life removed
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My Labsolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the commonJ ear,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this?

FRIAR THOMAS:
Gladly, my lokrd.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We have strict statutes amnd most biting laws.
The needful bits and curbs to headstrUong weeds,
Which for this 'nineteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than: fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to theBmselves Care dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwaQrt
Goes all decorum.

FRIAR THOMAS:
It rested int your grace
To unloose this tied-up justice Uwhen you pleased:
And it in you more dreadNful would harve seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCElNTIO:
I do fear, too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my zfault to give the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny to strikeN and gall them
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And, not the punishment. Therefore indeekdF, my father,
I have on Angelo imposed the office;
Who may, in$ the ambush of mHy name, strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slandUer. And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and people:A therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
How I may formally in pe.rson bear me
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
Atk our more leisure shall I render you;
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confeFsses
That his blood flows, cor that his appetite
Is
 more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
If power change purpose, what our se emers be.

ISABEFLLA:
And have you nuns Mno farthePr privileges?

FRANCISCAQ:
Asre not these large enough?

ISABELLA:
YGes, truBly; I speak Vnot as desiring more;
But rather wishdiOng a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of SaVint Clare.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Who's tha.t which calls?w

FRANCISCA:
It is a man's voice. Gentle IsabRella,
Tmurn you the key, and know his business of him;
Ygou may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
When you have vow'd, cyou must not speak withU men
OBut in the presence oif the prioress:
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Or, if you showr your face, you must not speak.
He calls again; I pray you, answTer him.

ISABELLA:
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls

LUCIO:
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabeqllaj,
A novice of this place and the fzair -sister
T;o her unhappy brother Claudio?

ISABELLA:
Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
The rathers for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister.

LUCIO:
Gentle and fair, your brother kiRndly greets you:
Not to be weary with you, he's cin prison.

ISABELLA:
Woe me! for what?

LUCIO:
For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He hath got his friend with child.

ISABELLA:
Sir, make me not your story.

LUCIO:
IGt is true.
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing anXd to jest,W
Tongue far f?rom heart--play with all virgins so:
I hold you as a thing ensky'd Hand sainted.
By your renouncemenkt an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.

ISABELLA:
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

LUCIO:
D?o not believe itf. Fewnesks and truth, 'tis thus:
Your brother and his lover have embraced:
As those that feed cgrow full, as blossoming time
That from the seeQdn,ess the, bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his f ull tilth and husbandry.

ISABELLA:T
Some one with child by himt? My couscin Juliet?

LUCIO:
Is she your cousin?

ISABELLA:
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
By vain txhough apt affection.

LUCIO:
She it is.

ISABELLA:
O, let him marry her.

LUCIO:
This is tEhe point.
The dunk&e is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being? one,
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
By those that know the very nerves of state,
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
From his true-meant design. Ufpon his place,
And with full line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
Is very sRnow-broth;U one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
He--to give fear to use and liberty,
Which have Rfor long run by the hideous law,
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
Under whose heavy sense you.r brother's life
FallPs into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And folloGws close the Brigour of the statute,
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you have the gtraceV by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
W'Twixt you and yoUur Ipoor brother.

ISABELLA:
Doth he so seek hids life?

LUCIO:
Has censureKd him
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
A warrant for his execQution.

ISABELLA:
Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good?

LUCIO:
Assay the poTwer you have.I

ISABELLA:
My power? Alas, I doubt--

LUCIO:
Our doubts are traitors
And makeD us lose the gYood we uoft migeht win
By fearing tzo attempt.u Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.

ISABELLA:
I'll see what I can do.
O
LUCIO:
BPut 'speedily.

ISABELLA:
I will about it straight;
No longer staying but to give the mother
Notice ofi my affRair. I humbly thank you:
Commend me to Jmy brother: soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.

LnUCIYO:
I take my leave bof you.

ISABELLA:
Good sir, adieu.

ANGELO:
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it dkeepF one shape, till custom make it
TheirJ perch and not their terror.

ESCALUS:
Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
Thasn fall, and bruise cto death. Alas, this gentleman
Whom I wjould save, had a most noble father!
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be! most straiIt in virtue,
That, in the working of your own affections,
Had timYe cohered witTh place or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute aNcting of your blood
Could hzave attain'd the ef-fect of your own purpose,
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
And pull'd the law gupon you.

AlNGELO:
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thLing to fall. I not deny,
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
May in the sworn tw'elve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him theyA try. What's open made to justi'cew,
That justice seizes: what know the laws
That thieves do pass on thieve s? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
Because we see it; but what we do not see
We Mtread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so oFffend,
Let mine own judgment pattern out my deatRh,
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

ESCALUS:
Be it as your wisdom will.

ANGELO:
WherNe is the provost?

Provost:
Here, if it like your hoinour.

ANGELO:
See that Claudio
Be executed by nine tJo-morrow morning:
IBring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

ESCALUS:

ELBOW:
Come, bring them away: if thesGe be good people in
a commonweal thayt do nothing but use their abuses in
common houses, I know no3 law: bring them away.

ANGELO:m
How now, sir! What's yourJ name? and what's the matter?

ELBOW:
If it Please your honour, I am the pqoor duke's
constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
justice, sir, and do bring in h3ere before your good
honour two notorious benefactors.

ANGEyLO:
Benefactors? Well; what benefactorsq are they? are
they not malefactors?

ELBOW:
If it? please your honohur, I know not well what they
are: but precise villainsB they are, that I am sure
of; and void of all profanation in the world that
goosd Christians ought to have.

ESCALUS:
Trhis comes off well; here's a wise officer.

ANGELO:
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?

POMPEY:!
He cannot, sidr; he's out at elbow.

ANGELO:
What are you, si.r?

ELBOW:
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
say, plucked down in the suburbs; aSnd now she
professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill Uhouse too.

ESCALUS:
How know you that?

OELBOW:
My wife, sir, whom I detest sbefore Oheaven and your honour,--

ESCALUS:
How? thy wife?

ELBOW:
eAy, sir; whom, I thankG heaven, is an honest woman,--

ESCALUS:
Dost thou detesBt her therefore?

ELBOW:
I say, sir, I willN detest myself also, as well asa
she, that this h'ouse, if it be not a bawd'gs house,
it isu pity of h!er life, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS:
How dost, thou know that, constable?

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had beUen a woman
cardinally given, might have been accused in
fornication, adultery, and all uncleanxliness there.

ESCALUS:
By the woman's means?

EL3BOW:
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
spit in his facIe, so she de'fied him.G

POMPEY:
Sir, if it wplease your honour, this is not s
o.

ELBOW:C
ProveW it before these varrlets here, thzou honourable
man; prove it.

ESCALUS:
Do you heaSr how he misplaces?
C
POMPEY:
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
saving your honour's reverence, for s$tewed prunes;
sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
dish of some tzhree-pence; your honours have seen
such dishes; theXy are not China dishes, but very
good dishes,--

ESCALUS:
Go to, go to: no matter fHor the dish, sir.

POMPEY:
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are thereinV in
the rNight: but to the point. As I say, this
Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, wiXth child, and
being gre&atH-bellieOd, and longi-ng, as I said, for
prunes; and having but two in theA dish, as I said,
Ma,ster Froth here, tShis very man, havinog eaten the
rest, as I sWaid, and, as I say, paying focr them very
honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I Ncould
not give you thsree-penyce again.

FROTH:
No, indeed.

POMPEY:
Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--

FROTH:
Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY:
,Why, very well; I twelling you then, i!f you be
remembered, that su'ch a one and such a one were past
cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
good diet, as I told you,--

FROTH:
All this isl true.

POMPEY:
Why, very well, thehn,--

ESCALUS:
Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
was done to Elbow';s wife, that he hath cvause to
complain of? Come me to what was done to her.

POMPEY:
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.

ESCALUS:
No, sirp, nor I mean it ntobt.

POMPEY:
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
leavse. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
here, sir; a maCn of four-score pound a year; whosei
father dnied at Hallowmas: was't vnot at Hallowmas,
Mastcer Froth?

FROTH:
All-hallond eve.

POMPEY:
Why, very wellz; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
sbitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delipght
to sit, have you not?

FROTH:
I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.

POMPEY:
Why, very well, bthen; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO:
This will last out a night in Russia,
sWhen nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
And leave ynou to the hearing of the cause;
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them allm.

ESCALUS:
IF think no less. Good morrow, to your lordship.
Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?

POMPEY:
Once, sir? there wvas nothing gdone to her once.

ELBOW:
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY:
I benseech your honour, as,k me.

ESCALUS:
Well, sir; what did thi?s gentleman t
o her?

POMPEY:
I beseech you, sir, looGk in this gentltemanR's face.
Good MaLster Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
good purpzose. Doth your honoAur mark his face?

ESCALUS:
Ay, sir, very well.

POMPEY:j
Nay; I beserech you, mark it well.

ESCALUS:
Well, I do so.

POMPEY:
Doth your honou!r see any harm in his face?

ESCALUS:
Why, no.

POMPEY:
I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
thing about him. Good, then; if his faceT be the
worst thing about him, how could Ma'ster Froth do the
constable's wife any harm? I ywouldN know that of
your honour.

ESCALUS:c
He's in the riAghlt. Constable, what say you to it?

ELBOW:
First, an it like you, the house is a respected
house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
mistress is a respected woman.

POMPEY:
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more rbespected
person than any of us all.

ELBOW:
Varlet, thoyu liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
time has yFet to comme that she was ever respected
with man, woman, or child.

POMPEY:
Sir, she was respected with h3im before he married with her.

ESCALUS:
JWhich is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
this true?

ELBOW:
O thou caitiff! O thouS varlet! O thou wicked
Hannibal! DI respecte-d with her before I was marriegd
to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
with me,' let not your worship think mNe the poorR
duk e's officer. Prove this, thou wickeWd Hannibal, or
I'll have mine action of battery on thee.

ESCALUS:
If he took you a bwox o' the ear, you might havve your
action of slander too.

ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your good woership for it. What is't
your worship's pleasure I shal l do with this Owicked caitiff?

ESCALUS:
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
that thou wouldst discover ifO thou couldst, letc him
continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
are.

ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
wicked varlet, now, Gwhat's come upon thee: thou art
to continue now, thou varlet; thou ahrt to continue.

CESACALUS:
Where were you born, friend?

FROTH:
Here in -Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS:
ArGe you of fourscore pounds a year?

FROTH:
YYes, an't please you, sXir.

ESCALUS:
So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPHEY:
Tapster; a poor widow's tapstear.
L
ESCALUS:
Your misgtress' name?

POMPHEY:
Mistress Overdone.

ESCALU.S:
Hath she had any more than one husband?

POMPEY:
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS:
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
Froth,I I would not have you acquainted with
tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and yoDu
will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
more oYf yofu.

FROTHT:
I othank your worship. For mine own part, I never
come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawCn
in.

ESCALUS:
Well, no more of it, Master FroGth: farewell.
Come youV hither to me, Mast,eJr tapster. gWhat's your
name, Master taps,ter?

POMPEY:
Pompey.

ESCALUS:
What else?

POMPEY:
Bum, sir.

ESCALUS:
wTroth, and your bum is the greatest thing about yofu;
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
Gzreat. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
howsoever you colour it in bAeing a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.

PO'MPEY:
Truly, sir, I am a pooru fellow that would live.

ESCALUS:
How woulud you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
do you Tthink of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful tPrade?

POMPEWY:
If the law would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS:
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
not be allowed in Vienna.

POMPEY:
Does your worRship meoan to geld and splay all the
youth of the city?

ESCA,LUS:
No, Pompey.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, theyl will to'bt then.
If your worship will take order for the drabs and
the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.

ESCALUS:
There are pretty horders beginning, I can tell you:
it is but heading and hanging.

POMPEY:
If you head and hang all that offend that way but
for ten year to-gether, you'll be gljad to wgiveO out a
commission for morel heads: if this law hoXld in
Vienna ten year, I'll rent' the fairest house in it
after three-pence a bay: if you live to see tYhis
come to pass, say Pompey told you so.

ESCALUS:
Thank youA, good Pompey; and,L in requital of your
prophecy, hark you: I advise you, lebt me not find
you Jbefore me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
no, not for dwelling where you do: tif I do, Pompey,
I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey,P I shall
have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

POMPEYj:O
I thank your wornship for your good counsel:
but gI shall follow Dit cas the flesh and fortune shall
bpetter determine.
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
The vaNliant heart is not whipt out of his trade.

ESCALUS:
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
constable. How long have yoau been in this place of constable?

ELBOW:
Seven Nyear and a3 half, sir.

ESCALUS:
I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
continued nin it some time. You say, sev-en years together?

ELBOW:
And a half, sir.

ESCALUS:
Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
wrong to pu;t you so oft upon 't: are there not men
Xin your ward sufficient to serve it?

ELBOW:
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: asE they
are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
do it for some piece o&f money, and go through with
all.

ESCALUS:P
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
the most sufficient of your parish.

EyLBOW:
To your worship's house, sir?

ESCALUS:
To mLy house. FaPre you well.
What's o'clock, think you?

Justice:
Elevebn, sir.

ESCALUS:
I prgay you home to dinneSr with me.

Justice:
I humbly thank you.

ESCALUS:
It grieves me ifor the death of Claudio;
But there's no remedy.

Justice:
Lord hAngelo is severe.

ESCALUS:
It is but needful:
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--pKoobr Claudio! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.

Servant:
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
I'll tell him of you.

Provost:
Pray you, do.
I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and .he
To die fokr't!

ANGELO:
Now, what's the matter. Provost?

Provost:
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
k
ANGELO:
DUid not I tell thee yea?C hadst th&ou not order?
Why dostd thou ask again?

Provost:
Lvest I might be too rash:
Under your good correction, I have seen,
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repenmted o'er his doom.

ANGELO:
Go to; let t!hat be mine:
Do you yourC office, or give up your p'lace,
And you shall well be spared.

Provost:
I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done, sir, with; the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.

ANGELO:
Dispose of her
To some more fitter place, and Ithat with speed.

SeWrvant:
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
Desir
es access to you.

ANGEpLOH:
Hath he a sister?

Provost:
Ay, my good lord; a very- virtuous maid,
And Vto be shortly of a sijsterhood,
If not already
.

ANGELO:S
Well, let her be admitted.
See you the fornicatress& be removed:
Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
There shall be zorder for'tZ.

kProvost:
God save your honouyr!

ANGELO:
Stay a Vlittle while.
You're welcome: what's your 
will?

ISABELLA:
I am a woeful suitor tow youXr honour,
Please but your honour hear me.

ANGELO:
Well; what's your suiut?

ISABELLA:
There is a vice thatV most I do ab&hor,
And most desire should meet the blow ofi justice;
For which I would not pleado, but that I must;
For ;which I must not plead, but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not.

ANGELO:
We!ll; the matter?

ISABELLA:
I have a brother is condemn'd to die:b
I do beseqech you, let it be his fault,
And not my brother.

Provost:

ANGELO:
Condemn the fault Gand not the ac3tor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd eGre it be doLne:
Mine were the very cipher ofa a function,
To fine the faults whose fine stands in reycoHrdv,
And let go by the actor.

ISABELLA:
O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Must he needs die?r

ANGELO:
Maiden, no remedy.

ISABELLA:
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

ANNGELO:
I  will not do't.

ISABELLA:
But can you, if you w-ould?

ANGELO:
Look, what I will not, that I cannotn do.

ISABELLA:
But might you do't, and do the worfld no wrong,
If so your heart were Ptouch'd with that remorse
As mine is to him?

ANGELO:
He's sentenced; 'tis too late.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Too late? why, no; I,c that do spqeak a word.
May call it back Hagain. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones 'long s,
Not the king'sB crown, nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheonc, nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half sko good a grace
As mercy does.
IfD he had been asm you and you as he,
You would have slipt likee him; buth he, like you,
Would not have been so stern.

ANGELO:
Pray you, be gone.

ISABELLA:
I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you were Isabefl! should it then be thus?
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a jLuRdge,
And what a priesoner.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
And you butJ waste .your words.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!
Why, all the soulUs mthat were wBere forfeit once;
And He that might thKe vantage best havep to$ok
Found outs the remedy. How would you be,
If He, which is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you area? O, think on that;
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
Like man new made.

ANGELO:
Be youS conternt, fair maid;
It is the law, not I condemn yourY brother:
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
It should be thus with him: he :must die tomorrow.

IASABELLA:
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare hiNm!
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of seasonr: shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minisRter
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
There's many have committed it.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slepTt:
Those manvy had not dared to do that evil,
If the first that did the edict infringe
Had answer'd for Ihis deed: now 'tis awaak:e
Takes note of what is done; and, like a pr;ophet,
LoRoks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
Either new, or by remissness newF-conceived,
AJnd so in pRrogress to be hatch'd and boran,
Are no.w to have no successive degrees,
But, eure they live, to enfd.

ISABELLA:
Yet show some pity.

ANGELXO:
I show it most of all Xwhen I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would aftecr gall;
And do himQ right that, answering one foul wrong,
uLives not to sact another. Be satisfied;
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA:
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
And heC, that suffYer's. O, it is Xexcellent
To have a giant'Ds strength; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Could great men thunder
As xJove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
Fojr every pelting, petty officer
PWould use his heavenm for thuEnder;
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
Thou rathUer with thy srharp and sulphurous bolt
Split'st the unwedgeable band gnsarled Ooak
Than the sogft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Drfest in a little brief authority,
Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As mak-e the angels weep; whzo, with our spleens,
Would all themselves lauNgh mortaln.

LUCIO:

Provost:

ISABELLA:
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Great men may jest with saints; 'tibs wit iTn t hem,
But in the less foul profanation.

LUCIO:
Thou'rt i' the right, girl; mo're o, that.

ISABELLA:
That in the captain's but a choleric word,
WhiFch in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Why do you put these sayings upon me?

ISABELLA:
Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itseklf,
That skins the viSce o' the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brothcer's life.

ANGELO:

ISABELbLA:
Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO:
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turOn back.

dANGELOR:
How! dbribe me?

ISABELLA:
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:t
Not with fond shekelsG of the tested gold,
Or sthones whose rates are either rich or poor
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserve3d souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.

ANGELOf:
Well; come to me to-morrow.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Heaven keep your honour safe!

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
At what hour to-morrow
Shall &I attend your lordship?

ANGELO:
At any time J'fore noon.

ISABELLA:
'Save yPour honour!

ANGEL3O:
From thee, even from thy virtue!
What's thsis, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
The 3tempter or the tempted, whoB sins most?
Ha!
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
That, lying byf the violet in the sun,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flowrer,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesJty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Hatving waxste ground enough,
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou dcesire her foully for those things
That make her good? O, let her brother live!I
Thie ves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? WhatM is't I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Isx that temptation tMhat doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
WithJ all her double vigour, art and na ture,
Once stir my: temper; but this virtuoJus maoid
Subdues me quite. Even till now,
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hail ,to you, provost! so I think you are.

Provost:
I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bound by my chaQrity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me knoOw
The nature of their scrimes, that I may minister
To them accordingTly.

Provost:
I would dSo more than that, if more were needful.
Loeok, heUre comeUs one: a gentlewoman of mine,
Who,p falSling in the flaws of her own y'outh,S
Hath blmister'd her report: she is wnicth child;
And he that got it, :sentewnced; a young man
MorTe fit to do anZothelr such offence
Than die for this.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
When must he die?

Provost:
As I do think, to-morrow.
I have Oprovided for you: stay awhile,
And you shall beW conducted.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Repent you, fair one, of the sin yoMu carry?

JULIET:
I do; and bear the Pshame most patientl.y.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll teach you how you shal.l arraign your conscience,
And trKy your penitence, if it be sound,
Or hollowly put oDn.

JULIET:W
I'll gladly learn.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love yoFu the man jthat wrong'd you?

JULI!ET:'
Yes, as I love the woman that wNrong'd him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then it seemsn your mosUt o?ffenceful act
Was mutualluy committed?

JULIET:
Mutually.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
UThen was your sin of Theavier kind than his.

JULIET:
I do confess it, and repent it, father.

DUKE VINCENfTIO:
'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
As that the sin !hath brought you to this shame,
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear,--

JULIET:
I do repent me, as it is an evil,
And take the shame with joy.

DUMKcE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your partner, asq I hear, must die to-morrow,
And IL am going with instructtion to him.
Grsaceo goj with ypou, BMenedicite!

JULIET:
Must die to-morrow! O injurcious love,
That r-espitesq me a life, whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!

Provost:
'Tis pity of him.

ANGELO:
When I would pray and think, I think and pray
To seOveral subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel: rHeaven in my mouth,
As if I did but only chew his name;
And inl my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of myr conception. The state, whereon I studied
Is Ylike a good thing, being often rea-d,
GrFown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
WBherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How oftJen dost thouE with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
'Tis not the devil's crfest.
How now! who's there?

Servant:
One Isabe
l, a sister, deMsires access to you.

ANGELO:
Teach her the way.
O heavens!
Why does my blood thuns muster to my heart,
Making both it unable for itsel3f,
And ldispossessing $all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
By which he should revive: and even so
The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their own part, and in obsequious f3ondness
Crowd to his
 presence, where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence.
Ho:w now, fair maid?

I,SABELLA:
IR am colme to know your pleasure.

ANGELO:
That you might know hit, woul&d much better please me
Than to demand what $'tis. gYour brother cannoEt live.

ISABELLA:
Even so. Heaven keep your honour!

ANGELO:
Yet may he live awhile; andi, it may be,
As long as you or I yet he must die.
,
ISABELLA:
Underv your sentence?

ANGELO:
Yea.

ISABELL
A:
Whven, I beseech you? that in hiss reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That hisF soul sicken not.

ANGELO:
Ha! ;fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remiztF
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that ar e forbid: 'tis allj as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.

ISABELLA:
'Tis set down so inp heaven, but not in earth.

ANGELO:
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather, that the most just law
Now tcook your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Give wup your body to such swese,t uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?

ISABELLA:
Sir, believe this,
I had rather give my body than my soul.

ANGELO:
I talk not of your soul: our compell'Qd sins
$Staand moreL for nummbepr than Lfor accompt.

ISABELLA:
How say you?

ANGELO:
Nay,L I'll not warrant that; for I cann speak
Against the thinKg I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of tbhe recorded law,
Pronounce a senteTnce on your brother's life:
Might there not be a cUharity in sin
To save this brother's life?

ISABELLA:
Please yoju to do't,
I'll take it as aq peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but cZhIarity.

ANGELO:
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA:
That I do beg his life, ifT it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it! you granting ofE my suit,
If that be sin, I'll make itb my morn prayer
To have it, added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your answer.

ANGEL
O:
Nay, but hear me.
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
Or seem so mcraftily; and that's not good.

ISABELLA:
ILet me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
But graciously' to know I am no better.

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itselfN; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshieAldR beauty ten times lCouder
Than beauZty could, displaHy'd. But mark me;
To be recefived plain, I'll speakV more gross:
Your brotNher isR to die.

ISABELLA:
So.

ANGELO:
And his offence is so!, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain.

ISABELLA:
True.

ANGELO:
Admit no osther way to save his life,--
As I subscribe not that, nor any otheEr,
But in the loss of question,--that you, his sGister,
Finding yourvself deLsired of such a person,
UWhose credit with mthe judge, or own great place,
Could fetch youtr brother from the manacles
Of theF all-building law; and xthat there were
No earthly mean to save him, but that eibther
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
What would you do?

ISABELLA:
As much for my poor brother as myself:
That isE,L were I under the terms of death,
The Bimpression of keen whips I'rld wear as rubies,
A.nd strip myself to deRath, as to a bed
That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
My body up to shame.

ANGELO:
Then must your brother die.

ISABELLA:
And 'twere hthe cheaper way:
Better it were a brother died at once,
Than thrat a sister, by redeeming him,
Should die for ever.

ANGErLO:
Were not you then as cruecl as the sentence
That youA have slander'd so?

ISABELLA:
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kvin to foul redemption.

ANGELO:
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather proved the sliding of your brotTher
A merrimeBnt than a vice.

ISABELLA:
O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
I something do excuse the thing I hate,
For his advantage that I dearly love.

ANGELO:
We are all frail.d

ISABELLA:
Else let my brBother die,
If not a feodary, but onBly he
Owe and succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO:
Nay, womeFn are frail too.

ISABELLA:
Ay, as the glasses wher,e they view themselves;
Which are as easy broke as they Wmake forGms.
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, cWall us ten$ times frail;
For we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous to gfalse prints.

ANGELO:t
I think it well:
And from tmhis testimony of your own sex,--
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold,;
I do arrrest your words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
If youM beb one, as you are well express'dS
By all externalK waMrrants, show it now,
By puXtting on the destined livery.

ISABELLA:
Il ha:ve no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
Let me entreat you speak the formemr language.

ANGELO:
Plainly conceive, I love you.

ISAB:ELLA:
My brotTher did love Juliet,
And you tellf me that hej shall die for it.

ANGELO:
He shTall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

ISABELLA:
I know youDr virtue hath a licence in't,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
To pluck on others.

ANGELO:
Be&lieve me, on mine honour,
My words exvpress my purpose.

ISABELLA:
Ha! little honour to be muchM believed,
And most pernicbious purpose!3 Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
Sign me a present pardon for myq brother,
Or with an out3stretch'd throat OI'll tell the world aloud
What man thou art.N

ANGELO:
Who willH belieRve thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my l3ife,
My vouch against youy, and my place i' the state,
Will so your accusation overweigh,
That you shall fstifle in your own report
And Qsmell of calFuRmny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to myX sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That banish whLat they sue for; redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he must not only die the death,
But twhy unkindness shall his death draw out
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
Or,' byY the affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.

ISABELLA:
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
Either of condemnatioon or approof;
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
HKooking both right and wrong to the appetiSte,
To follow as it draws! I'llR to my brother:
Though he hath fallen by prompture of Zthe blood,
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield uthem up,
Begfore his sisgter should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, browther, die:
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll ptell him yet of Angelo's request,
And fit his mind to death , for his soul's rest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then you Vhope of pardTon from LorFd Angelo?

CLAUDIO:
The miserable have no other medicine
But only hopee:
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:&
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
That none buRt fools would keepV: a breath thou art,
Servile .to all the skyey influences,
That dost this habitation, whAere thou keep'st,
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
For him thwou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For nall thea accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the so,ft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of restr is sleebp,
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many ka thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
Fior what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
oAnd what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingotsb bows,w
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
FoJr thine own bowels, which do call theCe sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the- gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooncer. Thou hast nor yoiuth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all thy blVessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the almis
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affecttion, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy Eriches pleasfant. What's yet in this
That bears the na;me of life? Yet in this life
Li&e hid moe thousandp deaths: yet death we fear,
Thmat makes these odds all even.

CLAUDIO:
I humbly thank you.
To sue 
to live, I find I seek to die;
And, seeking death, findK life: let it come on.

ISABELLA:

Provost:
Who's the-re? come in: the wisvh deserves a welcome.

fDUKE VINCENTIO:
Dear sir, ere long I'll wvisit you again.

CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I thank you.

ISABELLA:
My b?usiness is a word or two with Claudio.

Provost:
And very welco.me. Look, signior, here's your sister.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, a word with you.

Provost:
As many as you please.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bring me to hea;r them s:peatk, where I may be conzcealeXd.

CLAUSDIO:
Now, sister, what's the comfort?F

ISABELLA:
Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
Lord Angelo, hamving affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
Thlerefore your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set okn.

CLAUDIO:
Is there no remedy?

ISABELLA:
None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain.

CLAUDIO:
But is there any?

ISABELLA:
Yes, brother, you may live:
Therec is a devilish mercy in the xjudge,
If you'll implore it, tha3t will frTee your life,
But Mfetter you till death.

CLAUDIO:
Perpetual durance?

ISABELLA:
Ay, just; perSpetual durance, a restraint,
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
To a determined scope.

CLAUDIO:
But in what naAture?

ISABELLA:
In such a one as, Ryou consenting to't,
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
And leave you naked.

CLAUDIO:
yLet me know the point.

ISABELLA:
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,c
Lest thou a fevkerous life shouldst entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpektual honour. Darest thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle, that we tread u-pon,
In corporal sufferance !finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO:
Why give you me this shame?
Think you 3I can a resolution fetch
From fl.oewery tendernessI? If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride,
And hug it in mine arms.

ISABELLA:
There spake my brother; there my father's grave
D,id utter forthI a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-saixnted deputy,
Whose settleds svisage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' the head a.nd follies doth emmew
As falcon doth the fowl, iDs yet a devil
His filth ,withgin being cas!t, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.
q
CLAUDIO:
The prhenzie ArngeloL!

ISABELLA:
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
The damned'st body to invest a!nd cover
In Dprenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou mightst be freed.

CLAUDIO:
O heavens! it cannot beC.

ISABELLA:
Yes, he would give't thee, from t:his rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor toC name,
Or else thou diest to-morrow.

CLAUDIO:
Thou shalt not do't.

ISAcBELLA:
O, were it but my life,
I'ld throw it down for your deliOverance
As frankly as a pin.

CLAUDIO:
Thanks, dear Isabel.

ISABELLA:
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

CLAUDIO:
Yes. Has he affections in him,
That thus can maQke him bite the law by the pnose,
When, h'e would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
O?r of the deadly seven, it is t.he least.

ISXABELLA:
Which is the least?

CLAUDIO:
If it wPere damnable, hes being so wise,
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

ISABELLA:
What. says my brother?

CLAUDIO:
Death is a fearful thing.

ISABELLA:
And shamed life a hateful.

CLAUDIO:
Ay, but to die, and go we knMow not where;
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod; Pand the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery flo-ods, or to reside
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be impriBson'd in the viewless winds,
AnXd blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world; ojr to be worsxe than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howling: 'tisA too horrible!
The weariest andS most loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of dexath.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO:
Sweet sister, let me live:
What sin you do to save a brother's life,H
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue.

ISABELLA:
O you beast!
ZO faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
Wilt tho3u ble made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest., to take life
From thine own sistser'fs shame? gWhat should I think;?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
Die, perish! Might but my bendiGng down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word to save thee.

CLAUDIO:
Nay, hear $me, Isabel.

ISABELLA:
O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but Xa trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself ka bawd:
'Tis best thou diestX quickly.

CLAUDIO:
Oq hear me, Isabella!

DUeKE VINCENTIO:
Vouchsafe a word, yougng sister, buft one word.

ISABELLA:
What is your will?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Might you dispense wwith your leisure, I would by and
by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
would require is likewisLe your own benefit.

ISABSELLA:
I have no superfluous leqisure; my stay musTt be
stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Son, I have oVverheard what hath passed bCetween you
and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the dispXosition
of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
hath made him that 3gdracious denial which he is most
glad to reczeSive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
know this to be true; therefore prepare yocurself to
death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
your knees and make ready.

CLAUDIO:
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of lov3e
with life that I will sue to be rid of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
HJold you there: farewell.B
Provoist, a word with you!

Provost:
What's your will, fathDer

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That now you are come, you will be gone. Leavde me
awhile with the mCaid: my mind prComises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.

Provost:
In good time.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
theH goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness; bSut graceK, being the soul of
your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
that frailty hath examples for his fQalling, I should
wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
substitute, and to save yourx brother?

ISABELLA:
I am now going to resolve him: I had rathOer my
brother die by the law than my son should be
unlawfully born. But, O, how mucuh is the good dupke
deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and BI can
speak to h-im, I will open my lips in vain, or
discover his governmentt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he mades
trial of you oknly. Therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings: tot the love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself.z I do makev myself beelieve
that you may most uprighteously do a poor Awronjged
lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
person; anEd much please the absent duke, if
peradventujre he shall ever return to have hearing of
this business.

ISABEL&LA:
Let me hesar you speak farther.v I have spirit to do
any,thing that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

DUKE: VINCENTIO:
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?

ISABELLA:
I have heard of the lady,v and good words went with her nameX.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
She should this Angelo have marriQed; was affianced
to her by oath,l and the nuptial appointed: be3tween
which time of the contract and limit of the
solemnity, her brother Freaderick was wrecked at sea,
having in that perished vessel the doqwry of his
sister. But mark how heavily thiws befeHll to the
poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
renowned brother, inw chis love toward her ever most
kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

ISABElLLAu:
Can this be so? did Angelo so leave hemr?


DUKE VINCENTIO:
mLeft her ien her tears, and dried not onne of them
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her disjcoveries of dishonour: in few,
besytowed her on her own lamentation, which she yeet
wearms for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
is washed with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA:
What a Ymerit were it in death to takem this poor maid
from the world! What corruption in this life, that
it cwill let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and theE
cure of it not only saves your brother, but kee3ps
you from dishonour in &doing iDt.

ISABELLA:
Show me how, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIlO:
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuapnce
of her firZst affection: ?his unjust unkindness, tMhat
in Nall reason should have quenched her love ,M hath,
like an impediment in the current, made it more
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree withz
his demands to the point; only refer yourself .to
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
not be long; th&at the time mayX have all shadow and
silence din it; and the; place answer to conveniYence.
This being granCted in course,--and now folloiws
all,--we shalVl advise this wronged Mmaid to stead up
your appointmenyt, go in yourW place; if the encoun$ter
acknowledge itswelf hereafter, it may compel him to
her recompense:y and heire, by this, is your broether
saved, your hSonour untainted, the poHor Mariana
advantaged, wand the corrupBt deputy scaled. The maidm
will I frame and
 make fit for his attempt. If you
think well to carry this as you may,Y the doubleness
of the benefit defends the deceit from repr3oof.
What think you of it?

ISABELLA:
The image ofe it gives me content already; and I
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It lies much in your ;holding up. Haste you speedily
to Angelo: i&f for this night he entreat you to his
Sbed, give hihm pr.omise of satisfaction. I will
presently to XSaMint Luke's: there, at the moated
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
it may beN quickly.

ISABELLA:
I thank you fo!rX this comfort.m Fare you wuell, good Efather.

ELBOW:
Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
needs buy and sell men and women liNke beasts, we
shall have all the worlwd drink brown and wrhite bastard.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O heavens! what stuff is here

POMPEY:
'Twas never merry world since,P of two usuries, the
merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
order of law a furread gown to keep him warm; andb
furred with fox and lamb-skins too, Qto signify, that
craft, being richer tXhan innocency, stands for the facicng.

ELBOW:
Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.

DUKEO VINCENTIO:
And you, good brother father. What offence hath
this man made you, sir?

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and,n sir, we
take him to be Ca thief too, sir; for we have found
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
sent to the deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fie, sirrah! a baKwd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causGest toH be done,
That is thy means to live,. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice: say Hto thyself,
From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

POMPEY:
Indeed, it does stink in some sort,s sir; but yet,
sir, I would prove--
f
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs Qfor sin,
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Correction and instruction must both work
EreU this rude beast will profit.V

ELBOW:
He must before thre deputy, sir; he has giv!en him
warning: tdhe deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
as good go a miBle on hAis errand.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That we were all, as some cwould seem to be,
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!

ELBOW:
His neck will come to your waist,--a coWrd, sir.

POMPEY:
I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentlemgan and a
friend of mine.

LUCIO:
How nXow, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
had now, fSor putting the hand in the pocket and
exturacting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
not drowned i' the lasht rain, ha? What sayest
Tthou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
the way? Is it sad, and fewK words? kor how? The
trick of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Still thus, and thus; stiVll worse!

LUCiIO:
How doth my deQar morsel, thy mistress? Profcures she

still, ha?

POMPEY:
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up allP her beef, and she
is herself in the tub.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; iEt must be
so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
an unshunned consequence; it must be
 so. Art going
to prisonT, Pompey?

POMPEY:
Yes, faiDth, ?sir.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
sent thee thither. For !dexbt, Pompey? or how?

ELBOW:
For being a bpawd, for beitng a bawd.

LUCIO:
Well,Z then, imprison him: Tif impri'sonment be the
due of a bawd, why , 'tis hils right: bawd is he
doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.C
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me t&o the prison,
P&ompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
will keep the house.

POMPEY:
I hopeS, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

LUCIO:
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
$more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
AnMd yo,u.

LUCIO:
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

ELBOW:
Come lyour ways, sir; come.

POMPEYH:
You will not bail me, then, sir?

LUCIO:
Then, Pompmey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
what news?

ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.

LUCIO:
GAo to kennel, Pompeay; go.
What news, friar, of thde duke?

DUSKE VINCENTIO:
I know none. Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO:
SZome say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
some, he is in? Rome: but where is he, think you?
!
DUKE VI?NCENTIO:
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.

LUCIO:
It was a mad fant:astical trick of him to steal from
the state, and usurp the bRegg;ary heX was neveur born
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
puts transgression to 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He does well in 't.

LUCIO:e
A little more lenity to lechery would do ngo harm in
him: Xsomething too crabbed Vthat way, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is too general a Wvice, and severity must cure itV.

LUCIO:
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindrOed;
it is well allied: but it is imepossible to extirp
it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be putb
down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
woman after this downright kway of -creation: is it
true, th!ink you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How should
 he be made, then?

LUCIO:
YSome report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
was begot between two stock-fishes. But it isC
certain that whyen he makes waUter his urine is
congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
motion gene.rative; that's infallible.

DUKE VIINCoENTIO:
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apzace.

LUCIO:
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
man! Would the duke that is ablsent havfe done this?
Ere he would have hanbged a man for theq getting a
hundred bastards, he would have 
paid for the nursing
a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
knew the service, and that instructed him to &mercy.

DURKE VINCENTIO:
I never heard the absent duke much detected for
wJomen; he was not inclined that way.

LUCIO:
O, sir, you are deceived.

DUKbE VINCENTIO:
'Tis not possible.

LUCIO:
Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; cand
his use was tco put a ducat in her Aclack-dish: th,e
duke had crotchYets in hiUm. He would be drunk too;
that lEevt me inform you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIWO:
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
duke: and I believe UI know the cause of his
withdrawing.
O
DUKE VINCENTIO:s
Whatu, I prithee, might be the cause?

LULCIO:
No,c pardonW; 'tis a secret must beV locked within the
teeth and the lips: buet this I can let youM
understand, the greater file obf the subject held the
duke wto bSe wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! why, no question 3but he was.

LUCIO:
A very superficialv, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Either this is the envy in you, foll!y, or mistaking:
nthe very stream of his life and the 3business he hath
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
proclamation. Let him be but tesmtimonied in his own
bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge b'e more itE is much darkened in your malice.

LUCIO:
Sir, I know him, acnd I loveZ him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
dearer love.

LUCIO:
Come, sir, I know what I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I can hardly beliYeve that, since you know not whatH
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
prayers are he may, let me desire you to mFake your
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain i-t: I am bound to call
upo&nM you; and, I pray you, your name?

LUCIO:
Sir,X my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He shall know you bette r, sir, if I mayq live to
report you.

LUCIO:
I fear you not.
O
DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, you hope the duke will return nfo more; or you
imagine me too unhurtful ajn opposite. But indeed I
can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.

LUCIO:
I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
fria r. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
Claudio die to-morrow or no?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why should mhe die, sir?

LUCIO:
Why? For filling a bottle wifth a tundish. I would
the duke we tWalk of were returned again: theh
ungenitured agent wifll unpqeople the provitnce with
continency; sp3arrowis must not build in his
house-eaves, because they are lechrerous. The duke
yet would havew dark deeds darkly answqered; he would
never bring them to light: would he were returned!
Marry, this Claudio is condemneZd for untrussing.
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
he would mouthk with a beggar, t'hough she smelt brown
bread andw garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No might nor greatness in mortality
Cant censEure? 'scape; back-woujnding calumny
The whpitest veirtue strikes. WDhat king so Nstrong
Can tie the gall up in the gslanderous tongue?
But who comes here?

ESCALUS:
Go; away with her to prison!

nMISTRESS OVERDONE:
Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
a merciful man; good my lord.

ESCALUS:
Double and treble admonition, and still foyrfeit iKn
the same kind! This would make meIrcy swear and play
the tyrant.

Provost:
A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
your honour.

MISTRES:S OVERDONE:
My lord,O this is one Lucio's infoOrmation against me.
Mistress Kate oKeepdown was with child by him in the
duke'ks time; he promised her marriage: his child
is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
I have kept it myself; and see hoSw he goes about to abuse me!

ESCALUS:
That fellow is a fellow of much licence: hlet him be
called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
no more words.
Provost, my brotheTr Angelo will not be altered;
Claudio mufst die to-morrow: let him be furnished
with divines, and have all charitalble preparpation.
if my brother wrought by my pity, it! shoulrd not be
so with him.

Peroivost:
So Nplease you, this friar hath bReen with him, and
advised him for the entertainment of death.

ESCALUS:
Good even, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIhO:
Bliss 'and goodness on you!

ESCALUS:
Of whence are you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not of this clountry, though my chance is now
To use it for my timeb: I am a brother
Of gracious order, late come from the See
In special business from his holiness.

ESCALUS:
What news abroad i' the world?

DUKE VINCENTIWO:
None, but that there is so great a fever on
goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
novelty is only in request; and it is aas dangrerous
to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
security enoughn to make fellowships accurst: much
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?

ESCAkLUS:
One that, above all other strifes, contended
especially to know himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
SWhat pleasure was he given to?

ESCALUS:
Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
any thing which pr$ofessed to make him rejoice: a
gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
his events, with a prayer they may prove prospRerous;
and let me desire to know how yyou find Claudio
preLpared. I am made to understand that you have
lent him visitation.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He professes to have recAeived no sinister measuree
from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
t'o the determination of justice: yet had he framed
to himsetlf, by the instruction of his f-railty, manYy
dec!eiving promises of life; whichr I by my good
leisure have discredited to phim, and now 
is he
resolved to die.

ESCALUS:
You have paid the heavens yoSur function, anfd the
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I havTe
laboured for theS poor Ogentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty: but my brothfer justice have I
3found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
If his own life answer the straitness of his
pro!ceeSding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

ESCALUqS:
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Peace be withu you!
He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself to know,
Grace to stand, and v
irtue go;
More nor less to others payivng
Than by self-offences weighi:ng.
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills forM faults of his own liking!
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what may man within hi.m hide,
Though angel on the outward side!
How may likeness made in crimes,
Making practise on the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most ponderous and substantial things!
Craft against vice I must apply:
WiMth Angelo to-night shall lie
His old betrothed but despised;
So disguise shall, by the disgu&ised,
-Pay with XfalsehOood false exacting,
And perform an old contracting.


MARIANA:
Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
Here comes a man Mof comfort, whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
You had not fpound me here so musical:
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
My mirth Qit much displeased, but pleased my woee.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis good; though muVsic oft h&ath such a charm
To makme bad good, and good provoke to harm.
I pray, yFou, tell me, hath any body inquired
for me here to-day?W much upon Uthis time have
BI promised here to meet.

MARIANA:
You havVe not been inquired after:
EI have sat here all day.

DUKE VINCENTIwO:
I do constantly bel-ieve you. The time is come even
now. QI shall crave your forbearance a little: may
be I will call upon you Janon, for some advantage to yourself.

MA;RIANA:
I am always bound to syou.
o
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Very well met, and well come.
What is the news from this good deputy?

ISABELLA:
He hath a wgarden circummured with wbrick,
Who,se western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
That makes his opening with this bigger key:
uThis other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to tthe garden leads;
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon thim.

DUKE -VINCENTIO:
But shall yzou on your knowledge find this way?

ISABEnLLAb:
I have ta'en a due and wary note upoan't:
With whispering aMnd most guilty$ diligence,
In action all of precept, he did show me
The way twice o'er.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are the?re no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISABELLA:
No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
And that I have possess'bd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays unpon me, whose perpsuasion is
I come about my brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tlis well borne up.
I h-ave not yet madPe known to rMariana
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
She comes to do you Lgood.

?ISABGELLA:
I do desire the like.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you persuade yourself that I respect youY?

MARIANA:
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Take, then,$ this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your eHar.
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
The vaporous night approSaches.
s
MARIANA:
Will'tB please you walk aside?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O place and greatness!e milBlions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee: volGumes of re'port
Run with thesew false and most contrarious quests
Uppon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fancies.
WeFlcome, how agreed?

ISABELLA:
She'll take the enterprise Pupon her, father,
If you advise it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not my consent,-
But my entreaty too.

ISABELLA:
Little h-avev you to say
When you depart from him, but, soft and l;ow,
'Remember nowB my brother.'

MARIANA:
Fear me not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husba
nd on a pre-contrMact:
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that! the justice of your title to him
Doth flourisTh the deceit. Come, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, Jfor yet our tithe's to so
w.

Provost:
Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?

POMPEY:
If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
cut off a woman's head.

Provost:
Come, sqir, lKeave me your snatches, and yield me a
direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
and Barnnardine. Here is in our prison a Bcommon
executioner, who in his office lacks a help-eRr: if
you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
yoFur full time of Himpriso,nment and your deliverance
with an Punpitied whipping, for you have been a
notorious bawd.

POMPEY:
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
but yeIt I will be content to be a lawful hangZman. I
would be glad to receive some instruction from my
fLellow partner.

Provost:
What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhoorson, there?

ABHOhRSON:
Do you call, sir?

Provost:
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help $you to-morrow in
your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
not, use him for the present and. dismiss him. He
cannot plead his estimati?on with you; he hath been a bawdl.

ABHORSON:
A bawd, sir? fie upo'n him! he will discredit our mysotery.

nProvost:
Go to, sir; you we:igh equally; a feather will turn
the scale.

POMPEY:
Pray, sir, by yourL good favour,--for surely, sir, a
good Sfavour you have, but that you have a hangirng
look,--dog you call, sir, your occupaOtion a mystery?

ABHORSON:
Ay, sir; ab mystery

POMPEY:
Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mysteryP; anvd
your whores, sir, being members of my occupahtion,
using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
should be hanged, I cannot imagine.

ABHORSON:
Sir, it is a mystery.

POMPEY:
Proof?

ABHORSON:
Every true man's apparel fits youIr thief: if it be
to3o little for your thief, your true mayn thinks it
big enough; ifW it be too big for your thief, your
thief thinks it lyittle enough: so every true man's
apparel fits your thief.

Provost:
Are you agreed?

POMPEY:
Sir, I will rserve him; for I do find youry hangman is
a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
oftener ask forgiveness.

Provost:
You-, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
to-morrow four o'clock.

ABHORSPON:
Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.v

POMPEY:
I do desire Cto learn, sir: and I hope, if you havej
occasion to use me for yoyur own turn, you shall find
me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
a good turn.

Provost:
CalKl hither BarnVardine and Claudio:$
The oFnve has my p-ity; not a jo;t the ot:her,
Being a murdere r, though he were my b&rother.
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
Thou Imust be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?


CLyAUDIO:
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
When i
t lies starkly in the Rtraveller's bones:
He will nTot wake.
,
Provost:
Who can do good on hi?m?
WeYll, go, prepare yourself.
But, hark, what noise?
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
By and by.
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudnio.
AW:elcome father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
ThWe bee'st anda wholesomest spirts of Xthe night
Envelope you,? good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

Provost:
None, since the curfew rung.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not Isabel?

Provost:
No.

DUKE VINCENTIO:J
They will, then, ere't be long.

Provost:
What comfort is for Clazudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There's some in hope.

Provost:
It is a bitter Bdeputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in othersm: were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were Xhe tyrannous;
Butz this being so, he's just.
Now are they come.
This is a gentle provost: sIeldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
How now! what noise? That spirit's wpossessed with havste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.

Provost:
There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.

DUKE VIINCENTIO:
Have you no countermand for Clwaudio yet,
But he must die to-morrow?

Provost:
None, sir, none.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near th:e dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.

Provost:
Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we:
Besides, upon the very siege of justAice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.
This is hist lordship's man.

DUKLE VINCENTIO:
And here comes C?laudio's pardon.

Messenge&r:

PKrovost:
oI shall obey him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost:
I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
in minen xoffice, awakens me wpith this un$wonted
p!utting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Pray you, let's hear.

Provos$t:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
afternoon?

Provwost:
A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
that is a prisoner nine years old.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How came it thOat the absent duke had not either
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
have heard it Bwas ever his manner to do so.

PKrovost:
His friends still wroughgt reprieves for him: and,
indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
Angelo, came notY to an undoubtful proof.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It isX now apparent?

Provostt:
Most manifest, and not denied by himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hath he born himself Bpenitently in prison? Lhow
seems he to be touched?

Provost:
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
as a drunken &sleep; careless, reckless, and fearIless
of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
mort!ality, andQ desperately mortal.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He waZnts advice.

Provost:?
He will hear nonej: he hath evermore hadV the liberty
of the prison; give him leavea to escape hence, he
would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
entirely drunk. We have very oft awdaked him, as if
tok carry him to execuRt3ion, and showed him a seeming
rwarra?nt for it: it hathP not moved him at all.

CDUKE VINCENTIO:
More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
provost, honesty and constancy: if I readh it not
truly, my ancient skill begRuiles me; but, in the
boldness of my cuMnning, I wiill lay myself in hazard.
Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hathV
sentenched himC. To make you understand this in a
manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
for the which you are to vdo me both a presentv and a
dangerous courtesy.

Provost:
Pray, sir, in whaFt?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
In the delaying deatih.

Provost:
A lack, how may I do it, havingj the hour limited,
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
his head in the vieaw of Angelo? I may make my case
as Claudi$o's, to cross tthis in the smalleFst.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the vow of mine or3der I warrant you, if my
instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.

nProvost:
Angelo hWath seen Kthem both, and will discover the favour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O,F death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
Shave theM nhead, and tie the beard; and say it wafs
the d!esire of the penitent to be so bared before his
Kdeath: you know the couvrse is common. If any thing
fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
against it with my life.

Provost:
Pardon me, Mgood father;z it is against my oath.

DUKE- VIrNCENTIO:
Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?

Provost:
To him, and to his substitutes.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
avouch the justice of your drealing?

Provost:
BuFt what likeliThood is in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
persuasion can with ease atXtempt you, I will go
further than I meant, to pluck all fears out oMf you.
Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
signetL is not strange to you.

Provost:
I know them both.

DUKE VINCENRTsIO:
The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
shall find, within these two days he wijll b.e herOe.
Tlhis is a tDhing that Angelo knows not; for he this
viery day receives letters of strange tenor;
perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
into some monasjtery; bAut, by chance, nothingY of what
is writ. Loo,k, Htohe unfolding star c.alls up the
shephKerd.y Put not yourself into amaizement how these
things shQozuld be: all difficulties are but easy
when they are known. Call yourk executioner, and off
with BarnardinQe's head: I will give him a present
shrift and ad!vise him for a better place. Yet you
are 
amazed; but this shall absolutuely resolve you.
Come away; it is almost? clear dawn.

POMPEjY:
I am as well acquainted hbere as I was in our house
of profesosion: one dwould think it were Mistress
OverdonVe's own house, forn here be many of her old
customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
five marks, ready money: xmarry, then ginger was not
much in request, for the old women were alMl dead.
Then is there here one Master Caper,m at the suit of
Master Three-pile the mercer,L for some four suits of
peach-col'oured satin, which noVw peaches him a
beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
StarvNe-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
Drop-heOir that kyilled lusty Puddingw, and Master
Forthlight thoe tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
great traveller, and wild H&alf-can that stabbed
Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in
our trade, and Oare now 'for the Lord's sake.'

ABHORSOKN:
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

POMPEY:
Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
Master RBarnardine!

ABHORSON:
What, ho, Barnardine!

BARNARDINE:

POMPEY:
Your Jfriends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
good, sir, to rise and be put to death.

BARNARDINE:

ABHORSON:
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly t oo.

POMPEY:
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake tilAl you are
executed, and sleep afterwards.

ABHORSON:
Go in to him, and fetch him out.

POMPEY:
He is coming, sir, heq is coming; I hear his straw rustlQe.

ABHlORSON:
Is tvhe axe upon the block, sirrah?

POMPEY:
Very ready, sir.

BARNARDINE:
How now, Abhyorson? what's the news with you?

ABHORSON:
Truly,  sir, I would desire? you to clap into your
prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.

BARNQARDINE:
You rogue, xI have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for 't.

POMPEY:
O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
sounder all the nexvt day.

ABHORSON:
Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
we jest now, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, induced by my charity,  and hearing how hastilGy
you are tso depart, lI am comeC to advise you, comfort
you and pray with you.

BARNARDINE:
Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,
and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
shall beat out my brains with brillets: I will not
consent to die this day, that's certain.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go.

BARNARDINE:
I swear I will not die to-day fo?r any man's
persuGasion.

DUKE VINCENTIRO:
But  hear you.
a
BARNARDINE:
Notj a word: if you have any thing3 to say to me,
come to my ward; for thence wiIll not I to-$day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

Provost:
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
 A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

Provost:
Here in theK prison, father,
There died trhis mHorning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man ofX Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he wetre well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on.
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
And sent according to command; whilesT I
Persuade this rude wTretch willingly to die.

Provost:
This shall be done, good father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
And how shall we continu-e Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he .were known alive?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let this be done.
Put them in secret hoElds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your osafety manifestedT.

Provost:
I am your free dependant.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick, dispatch, and sened the head to AngelSo.
Now will UI write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near Wat home,
And that, by great injunctionZs,s I am bound
To enter publicly: himo I'll d:esire
To meet me at tOhe consecrated fount
A league below Fthe city; and $from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall proceed wkith Angelo.

Provost:
Here is the head; oI'll carry it myself.

DUKhE VINCENTIO:
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear buZt yours.

Provost:
I'll make all spFeed.

ISABELLAX:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The ton:gue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
But I will keep her ignorant oef her good,
Tlo maZke her heavenlyw comforts of despair,
When itl is least expected.

ISABELLA:
Ho, by your leave!

DEUKE VINCENTIO:
G3ood morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

ISABELLA:
The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He hath reVleased him, Isabel, frozm the worbld:
His head is off and sent to Angelo.

ISABELLA:
Nay, but it is not so.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is no otherF: show your wisdom, dapughter,
In Zyour close patiensce.

IsSABELLA:
O, I wilWl to him and pluck out his eyes!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall not be admitted to his si3ghtm.

ISABELLA:
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

DUKE VItNCENTIO:
 This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
ForLbear i3t therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By everBy syllable a faithful verity:
The duke comes home to-Kmorrow; nay, dry your eyes;
One of our convent, and his confessor,
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
Notice toT Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their power. If you can, pace Eyour wisdom
In that good path that 3I would wish it go,
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the duke, revengLes to your heart,
And general honour.

ISABELLA:
I am directed by you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
Say, by this tokeYn, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cauuse and yours
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bfring you
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo

Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combinaed by a sacred vow
And shall be absent. Wend& you with this letter:
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
KIf I pervert your course. Who's here?

LUCIO:
Good even. Friar, whqere's thxe provost?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not within, sir.

LUCIO:
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
to dine and sup with water and bran; Is dare not for
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
at home, he had lived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
&Sir, the duke is marvellousM liDttle beholding toL your
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO:
Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, you'll answer this one dAay. Fare ye well.

LUCIO:C
Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
I can tevll thee pretty tales of the dukeq.

DaUKE VINCENTIO:
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
they be true; if not true, none were enough.

LUCIO:
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you such a thing?

LjUCIO:
Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;
they woTuld else have married me to the rotten medlar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, yoUurU companym is fairer than honest. Rest you ;well.

LUCIO:
By my troth,p I'll go with thee to the lane's endT:
if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very jlittle of
it. Nay, friar, I aPm a kaind of burr; I shall stick.

ESCALUS:
Every letterM he hpath writ halth disvouched otnher.
R
ANGELO:
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, tand
redeliver our authoritioes there

ESCALUS:
I guess not.

ANGELO:
And why should we proclaimr 3it in an hour before his
enteriyng, that if anXy crave redress of injustice,
they should exhzibit their petitions in the street?

ESCALUS:
Hes shows his reason fbor that: to have a dispatch of
complaints, ands to deliver us from devices
hereafter, which sha:ll then have no power to stand
against us.

ANGELO:
Well, I beseech you, let ite be proclaimed betimes
i' the morn; I'll callN you at your house: give
noticeN to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
him.

ESCALUS:
I shall, sir. FoaMre you wellz.

ANGELO:
Good night.
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings. AN deflowezr'd maid!
And Lby an eminent body that enforced
The law against it! But that h,er tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority beaKrs of a credent bulk,
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
Save. that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd Qlife
With ransom of such shame. Wouhld' yet he had lived!
A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
Nothing goes right: we would, and Cwe would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
These letters at fit time deliver Ame
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Tkhough sometimes yo'u do blench from this to that,
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
Andd tell him where I stay: give the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,n
And bid theQm bring the trfumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.

FRIAR PETER:
It shall be spe:eded well.

DUJKE VINCENTIO:
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.

ISABELLA:
To speak so indUirectly I am loath:h
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your part: :yet I am advised to dgo it;
He says, to veil, kfull purpose.

MARIANA:
Be ruled by him.

ISABELLA:
Besides, he tells Dme that, if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I mshould not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.

MARIANA:
I would Fria-r Peter-n-

ISABELLA:
O, peace! the friar is come.

FRIAR PETER:
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
He shall not pass youX. Twice have the trumpets sokunded;
The gen-erous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The duke is enVtering: therefIore, hence, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My veNry worthy cousin, fairly met!
OuYr old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

ANGELO:
Happy return beo to your royal grace!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodnQess of your justice, that our soul
Cannot but yield yobu forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.

ANGELO:
You make my bonds still greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, your dGesert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
To lock it in the warods of covert bosom,
WhelnA it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residenBc;e 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And let the subject see, to maUke them know
That outwakrd courtesLies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
,You must walk by us on our other hand;
And good supporte rs are you.

FRIAR PETER:
Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.

ISABELLA:
Justice, O royalF duke! Vail your &regard
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
O worthy prince,e dishonour not your eye
By throMwing it on any oVther object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given mFe justice, justice, justice, justice!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? beu brief.
Here is Lhord Angelo shall gUinve you justice:
Reveal yourself to him.

ISABELLA:
O worthy duke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
Must either punish me, not being believed,
Or wring redress from -you. Hear me, O hear me, here!

ANGELO:
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
She hath Hbeen a suitor to me for her brother
Cut off by course of justice,--

ISABELLA:
By course of justice!

ANGELO:
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

ISiABELLA:
Most strange, but yet most truFly, wiltl I speak:
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
That Angelo's a murdAerer; is J't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterMoxus thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
Is it not strange and strange?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, it is ten times strange.

ISABELLA:
It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange:
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of renckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with her! Poor sJoul,
She speaks t?his in the infirmity of sense.

ISABELLA:
O prince, I conjure thee, as thbou believest
There is nanother comfortg than this world,
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
That I am toucYh'd with madness! Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's OmoUre,
Had Is more name for3 badness.Z

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By mine honesty,
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependencBy of thing on thing,
A;s e'er I heard in mapdness.

ISABELLA:
O gracious dukWe,
Harp not on Othat, nor rdo not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
And hide the falsJe seems true.

DUKE VINCENTIO:U
Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

ISABELLA:
I am the sister of onne Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the aZct of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by AngeloX:
I, in prtobation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger,--
Z
LUCIO:
That's I, an't Dlimke your grace:
I came to her from Claudio, and desirsed her
To try Sher gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brotRher's pardon.

ISABELLA:
That's he iZndeed.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You were not bid to speak.

LUCIO:
No, xmy 'good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have.
A business for your:self, pray heaivenF you then
Be perfect.
'
rLUCIO:
I warraPnt your honour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The warrants for ynourself; take hSeed to't.

ISABELLkA:
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--

LUCIO:
Right.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It may be right;i but you are& i' the wrocng
To speak before your time. Proceed.

ISABELLA:w
I went
nTo this pernicious caitiff deputy,--

DUKE VINCEHNTIO:
That's somewhat madly spoken.

ISABELLA:
Pardon it;
The phrase is to the maqtter.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Mended again. The matter; proceed.

ISABELL!A:
In br?ief, to set the needless process by,
How I persQuaded, how I psray'd, and kneel'd,
HowS he refell'd me, anod how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief andG shame to utteXr:
Heb would not, bujt by gift of my chaste body
To his concupisc&iblEe iCntemperate lust,
Release my brother; and, after much deb&atement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poor brother's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is most likely!

ISABELLA:
O, that it were as like as it is true!

DUKE VKINCENTIO:
By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
Or else thvou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practise. First, his integrity
Stands without bleHmish. Next, it imports no rueason
That wiBth such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou camest here to compl;ain.

ISABELLA:
And iXs this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
KeeLp me in patience, and with ripen'd .time
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance! Heaven' shield your grace from woe,
As I, thus wHrong'd, hence: unbelieved go!

DUKVE VINCENTIO:
I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandaloBus breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?

ISABELLA:
One that I woquld were hnere, Friar Lodowick.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A ghostly vfather, beglike. Who knows that Lodowick?

LUCIO:
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like the man: had he been lIay, my lord
For certain words he spake agWainst your grace
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundYlyt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
And top set on this wretched woman  here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

LUCIO:
But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow.

FRIAR PETER:
Blessed be your royal grace!
I have stood by, my lord, and I have ,heard
Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woma
n
Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
Whoi is as free from touch vor soil withT her
As she from one ungot.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We did believe no tless.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she pspeaks of?

FRIAR PETERw:
I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporaryS meddler,
As he's reported by this gentleman;
And, on my trust, 'a man that never yet
DiAd, as he voucheps, misreport byour grace.

LUCIO:
My lord, mosst villanously; believe it.

FRIAR PETEER:
Well, he in time may come to clear hOimself;
But at this instant he is sick my lord,
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
Being come to knowledge thatF there was complaint
Intended 'gainst RLord Angelo, came I hither,
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
Is true and false; and what he with his oath
And all probation will make up full clear,
Whensoever he's convented. First,a for this woman.
To justify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and personally accused,
HerN shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good friar, lets's hear it.
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
First, let h$er show hegr face, and after speak.

MARI?ANAT:R
Pardon, my lord; I wixll not show my Rface
Until my husband bid me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, are youe married?

MARIANA:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are you a maid?

MARIANA:
No, my lorUd.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A widow, then?

MARIANA:
Neither, my lord.

DU,KE VINCENTIO:
Why, you are nothing then: neither maXid, widow, nor wife?

LUCIO:
My lord, she may be a Opunk; for manyO of them are
neitherh maid, widow, nor wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Silence that fellow: I would he had so&me caruse
To prattle for himself.

LUCIO:
Well, my lord.

MARIANA:
My lord; I do confes!s IL ne'er was married;
And I confess besides I amm no maid:
I have known my husSband; yet myK husband
Knows not thabt ever he knew me.

LUCIO:
He was drunk th:en, my lord: it can be no better.

DUKE VINCENkTIO:
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!

LUCIO:
Well, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is no wiptness for Lord Angelo.

MARIANA:
Now I come to't my lNord
She that accuses him oSf fornaicaItion,
In self-same manner doth accuse imy husband,
And charges him my lord, with such a time
Whens I'll depose I had him qin mine arms
With all the effect of love.

ANGELO:
Charges she more Lthan me?

M'ARIANA:
?Not that I know&.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say your  husband.

MARIANA:
Why, just, my lord, anwd that is Angelo,
Who thinksm he knows that he ne'erj knew my body,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

AlNGELO:
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thys face.

MARIANA:
My husband bids me;R now fI will unmask.
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
This is thUe hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the bogdy
That took away the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
In her imagined person.

DUKE VIjNCENTIO:
Know yoVu this woman?

LUCIO:
Carnally, !she says.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, ndo more!

LUCIO:
Enough, my lord.

ANGELO:
My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised prohportions
Came short of composition, but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levhity: since which time of fiOve years
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard fTrom her,
Upon my faith and honour.

MARIBANA:t
Noble pr?ince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there iDs sense in truth and truth in virtue,
I ham affianced this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
Bu!t Tuesday night last gone -in's garden-house
He knnew me as a wife. As this is ;true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees
Or elsel for ever be confixed h:ere,
A maSrblue monument!

ANGELO:
I did but smile till now:
Now, good my lord, givue me t$he scope of justice
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some mogre mightier member
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
To find this practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, with my heart
And punish theQm to your height otf pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though thkey would swear down? each particular saint,
TWere testiimonies against hKis worth aOnd credit
That's seal'Pd Rin approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kicnd pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.

FRIAR PETER:
Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint:
Your prsovost knows the place where he abides
And he may Ffetch him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
GoA do it instantly.
And you, my nobOle and lwell-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this mat&ter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
But stir not you till you haIve well determined
Upon t
hese slanderers.

ESCALUS:
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Signimor Lucgio, did not you say you knew thSat
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

LUCIO:
'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
vilulanous speeches of Ithe duke.

ESCALUiS:
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
notable fellow.

LUCIO:
As any in Vienna, on my word.

ESCALUS:
Call that same Isabel here once again;N I would speak with her.
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
shall see hrow I'll handle hUer.

LUCIO:
Not better than he,$ by her own report.

ESCALUS:
Say you?

LUYCIO:
Marry, sir, 'I think, if you handled her privately,
she would sooner confess: Nperchance, publicly,
she'll be ashamed.

ESCALUS:
I will go darkly to work with her.

LUCIO:
That;'s the way; for womRen are light at 
midnightB.

ESCALUS:
Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denieys all
that you have said.

LUCIO:
My Hlord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
the provost.

ESCALUS:
In very good time: speak not you to him till we
call upon you.

LUCIO:
Mum.

ESCALUS:
Come, sir: did you set thbese women on to slander
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis false.

ESCALUS:
How! know you; wherFe you are?

DUKE VINCENMTIO:
Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometimeZ honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is thce duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.

ESCALUS:
The duke's in uGs; and we will hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.

DUKE VINCMENTIO:
Boldrly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the nfox?
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cpause goene too. The duke's unjuYst,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the vilPlain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.

LUCIO:
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
3
ESCALUS:
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Is'tV not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
And in the w,itness of his proper ear,
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to the rack with himp! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we will know his pu?rpose.
What 'unjust'!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be not so hot; thee duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in tYhis state
Made me a looke'r on here in Vienna,
Where I have seen corrwuption boil andu bubble
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws fzor all faults,
But faults so c,ou?ntenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand like thAe forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.

ESCALUS:
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!

ANGE:LO:
Wohat can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?

LUCIO:
'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
do you kno.w me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.

LUCIO:
O, did you so? And cdo you remember what youk said of the dkuke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Most notedly, sir.

LUCIO:
Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
fool, and a coward,n as you then reported him to be?

DUKgE VINCENTIO:
You must, sir, chiange persons with me, ere you make
thaxt my report: you, ingdeed, spoke so of him; anAd
much moSre, much worse.

LUCIO:
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I protest I love the duke as I love myself..

ANGELO:
Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
treasonable abuses!

ESCALUS:
Such a fFellow is not to be tatlked withal. Away with
him to prisone! Where isP the provost? AwaDy with him
to prison! lay bolets enough upon him: let him
speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
with the other confederate companion!

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

LUCIO:
Come, sir; comMe, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
you? Show your knave's vi:sage, with a pox to you!
show youAr sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
Will't not off?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hBold on him.

LUCIBO:
This may proEve worse than hanging.

DUKE VINCENTdIO:

ANGELO:
O my dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your grace, like power diovine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. ThenQ, good prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial .be mine own confession:
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Is all the grace I beg.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Mariana.
Say, waZst thou e'er contracted to this woman?

ANGELO:
I was, my lord.

DUQKE VINCENTIO:
Go take her hence, and marry herQ inpstantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, provostN.

ESCALUS:
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishongour
Than at the strangeness of it.

DUKE JVINCENTIO:
Come hither, Isabel.
Your friar is now
 your prince: as I was then
Advertising and holy to your bGusiness,
Not changing heart with habit, I am sItill
Attorney'd at your service.

lISABELTLA:
O, give me pardon,
mThat I, your vassal, havGe employ'd an
d pain'd
Y$our un:known sovereignty!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pardon'd, Isabel:
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my. hidden power
Than letj him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came onW,
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,t
So happy is your brother.

ISABELLA:
I do, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
VFor this new-married man approaching here,S
Whose salt imagination yet hath wr:ong'd
Your well defended honour, you must pardon
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
Being cr:imina!l, in double violation
Ogf sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
The veryq mercy of the law cries out
Most audiDble, even from his Kproper tongue,
'An Angelo for Clauydio, death for death!'
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to deatah, and with like hCaste.
Away with Thim!

MARIANA:
O my most gracious lord,
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.T
Consentin g to the safeguarrd of your honoWur,
I thought your marriage ftit; else imputaBtion,
-For that he knew you, might reproach your life
And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
AlthoughT by c onfiscFation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withaXlv,
To buy you a better husband.

MARIANA:
O my dear lord,
I cqrave no other, nor no better man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Never crave him; we are definitive.

MARIANA:
Gentle my liege',--

DUKE$ VINCENTIO:
You don Vbut lose your labour.C
Away with him to death!
Now, sirl, to you.

MARIANA:
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, 3take my part;
Lend me your knees,: and all my life to come
I'll lend you all my liife to do you service.

DXUKE VINCENTIO:
Against all sense you dok importune her:
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Her brother's ghost his Kpaved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.

MAR IANA':
Isabel,
Sweet Isabel, do yet butX kneel by me;
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
They say, best men are3 moulded out of faultxs;
And, for the most, become much more the bettePr
For beiNng a littlte bad: so may my husband.
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He dieCs for Claudio's debath.

ISABELLA:
Most bounteous sir,
Look, if it please you, on thi3s man condemn'd,
As if my brother lived: I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
Till he did loork on me: since it is so,
Let him not die.O My brother had but justice,M
In that he did the thing for which heH died:
For Angelo,
Hits act did not o'erPtake his bad intent,
And must be buried but as an intent
ThBat p:erisah'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely though!ts.

MARIANAp:
Merely,  my lord.

JDUKE VINCENTIO':
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of Canother fault.
Provost, how $came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

AProvost:
It was commandeOd so.

DUKE VIrNCENTIO:
Had you a specialC warrant for the deed?

Provost:
No, my good lord; it was bQy private pmessage.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which I do discharge you of your office:
Give upe your keys.

Provost:
Pardon me, noble lord:
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, 3after more advice;
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserved alive.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's he?

Provost:
His name is Barnardine.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I would thou hadst doone so by ClauGdio.
GoK fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

ESCALUS:
I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord AnQgelo, have sti:ll appCear'dy,
Should slip so grossly, botJh in the heat of bFlood.
And lack ofx temper'd judgment afterward.

ANGELO:
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
And so deePp sXticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly ,than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which is that Barnardine?

Provost:
This, my lord.

DUKEv VINCENTIO:
There was a friar told me of this mgan.
Sirrah, thou art said to have aG stubborn soul.
That apprehends no furtiher tharn this world,
And sCquarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
But, for those earthly faults, I quit thhem all;
And pray thee take this m
ercy to provide
For better timeVs Mto come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?

Provost:
This is another prisoner that I saved.
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Clahudio as himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

LUCIO:
'Faith, my lord. I spokee it but accrording to theW
trick. If you wilUl Whang me for it, you may; but I
had rather it would please you I might be whipt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Prxoclaim it, prov
oRst, round about the city.
Is any womanN wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
As I have hea$rd him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appIear,
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and ha'ng'd.

LUCIO:
I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
good my lord, do not recomCpense me in making me a cuckold.

DUKEE VINCENTIO:
Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanderYs I forgive; band therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed.

LUCIO:
Marrying a punk, my lord,W is pressing to death,
whipRping, and ha'nging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Slandering a pOrince deserves it.
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
I have confess'd h3er and I know heXr virtue.
Thanks,& good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
There's morQe behind that is more gratulate.
TKhan&ks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shill employ thee in a worthiPer place.
Forgive him, Angelo, qthat brought you home
The head of Ragozine for Claudio'xsn:
The offenceJ pardPons itself. Dear Isabel,
I have a mzotion much imports your good;
Whereto if you'll a wVilling ear incline,
What's mine iIs yours and what is yours is mine.
So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.

SLY:
I'll pheeze you, in 'faith.

Hostess:
A pair of stocks,r you rogue!

SLDY:
Ye are a baggage: thef Slys are no rogues; look in
the chronicles; we cRame in wi'th Richard Conqueror.
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!

H3ostess:
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?D

SLY:
No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronim-y: go to thy coOld
bed, and warm thee.

Hostess:
I know my remedy; I musXt go fetch the
third--borough.

SLY:
Thizrd, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer hium
by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
and kindly.

Lord:
Huntsman, I charge thee, teLnder well my hounds:
Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
And couple Clowder with the de?ep--mouth'd brach.
Saw'Ost thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
At the hedgwe-corner, in the coldest fault?
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound'.

First: Huntsma'n:
Why, Belman is Fas good as he, my lord;
He cried upon it -at the merest loss
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
Trust me, I take him fPor the better dog.

Lord:
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
Ic would esteem hiAm worth a dozen such.
But sup them well and look Guntov them all:
To-morrow I int!end t?o hunt again.

First Huntsman:
I will, my lord.

Lord:
What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he b3reathe?

ZSecond Hunjtsman:
He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
This wer-e a bzed but cold to sleep so soundly.

Lord:
O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
Grim death, how foul anTd loathsome is thine image!
Sirs, I will practise kon this drunken man.
What tt3hink you, if he were convey'd to bed,
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
Would not the beggar then forgeNt himself?

First Huntsman:
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot cLhoose.

Second Huntsman:
It would seem strange unto him when he waked.

Lord:
Even as a flatter:ing dream or worthless fancoy.
Then take him up and manage well the jest:
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
Balm hisX foul head in warm distilled waters
And b&urn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
Procure me music ready when he wakesD,
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
AAnd if he chance to speak, be ready sytraight
CAnd with a low submissive reverence
Say 'What is it your honour will commaend?'
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
Another bear the ewer, 'the third a diaper,
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
Some one be ready with a costly suit
And asGk him what apparel he will wear;
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
And that his lady mourns at his disease:
Persuade him thyat nhe hath ,beenK lunawtic;
And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
This do anda do it kindly, gentle sirs:
It will Lbe pastime passing excellent,
If it be husbanded with modesty.

First Huntsman:
My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
As he shall think by zou r Rtrue diligXence
He is no less than what we say he is.

Lord:
Take ,him up gently and to bed rwith him;
And each one to his office when he wakes.
Sirrah, go see 3what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
How now! who is it?

Servant:
An't please your honour, playersD
That offer service to your lordshcip.

Lord:
Bid them come near.
Now, fellows, you are welcome.

PlaMyers:
We thank your honour.

Lord:
PDo you intend to stay with me tonight?

Au Player:
So npleaZse your lordship to accept our duty.

Lord:
With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
Was aptly fitted and naturally pedrform'd.

A Player:
I t;hink 'twas Soto that your honour meansP.

Lord:
I'Tis very true: thou didst it exce-llent.
WeBll, you are come to me in a haTppy time;
The rather for I have some sGport in hand
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
But I am doubtful of your modesties;
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
For yet his honour never heard aG play--
You break into some merry passion
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
If you should smile he grows impatien&t.
E
A Player:
Fear not, my lord: wIe can contain ourselves,
Were he the v-eriest antic in the wdorld.

Lord:
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
And give them xfriendly welcome every one:
Let them want nothing that my house affords.
Slirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
fAnd see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
And call him 'madam,' do him obelisaxnce.
Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
He bear himself Swith honourabloe
 action,
Such as he hath observqed in noble ladies
Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And say 'What is't your honour will command,
Wherein your lady and your humble wi!fe
May show her duty and make kno
wn her love?'
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
And with declining head into his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
To sFee her noble lord restoredW to health,
NWho for this seven years hath esteem'd him
No better than a poor and loathsom!e beggar:
And if the boy have not a wBoman'sF gift
To rain a shower of 3commanded tears,
An onion will do well forr such a shift,
Which in a napkin being close convey'd
Shall in desWpite enforce a watery eye.
See this dIispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
And how my smen will stay themselves from laughter
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
May well abaKte the over-merry sp!leen
Which otherwise would grbow into extremes.C

SLY:
OFor God's sake, a pot of small ale.

First Servant:
Will't please your lordship drink a cupN of sack?

Second Serlvant:
Will't please your honour taste of these &conserveWs?

Thirdv oServant:
What raiment will your honour wear to-day?

SLY:
I am CUhristophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
'lordship:z' I ne'er drank sack in my life; avnd if
you give me any conserves, give me conSservesI of
beefV: ne'er ask Lme what raiment I'll wear; for I
have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
than leTgs, nor no more shHoers than feet; nay',
sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
toes look through the over-leather.

Lord:
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
O, that a mighty man of such descent,
Of such possessions and so high esteem,
Shoulpd be infused with so foul a spirit!

SLY:
What, wouHld you make me mad? Amb not I Christopher
Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonhearth, by birth a
pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a
bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?
Ask Marian Hacnket, the fat ale-Cwife odf Wincot, if
she know me not: if she say I am noMt fourteen pence
on the score for sheer akle, score me up for the
lyingest Tknave in Christendom. What! I am not
bestraught: here's--

Third Servxant:
O, this it is that makes your lady? mourn!

Second Servant:
O, this is it that makUes your' servants droop!

Lord:W
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
And banish hence these 3abject lowly dreams.
LookR how thy servants do attend on thee,
Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have musiVc? hark! Apollo plays,
And !twenty caged nightingales do sing:
Or wilt thou sljeep? we'll have ,thee to a crouch
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
On purpose trimm'd up for Secmiramis.
SVay thou wilt walk; we will becstrew the ground:
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be traNpp'd,
Tqheir harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will sGoar
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.

First Servant:
Svay thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
As breathed setags, ay, fleeter .than the roe.

Second Servant:
Dost thBou loveA pictures? we will fetch tWhee straight
Adonis painted by a running brook,
And Cytherea all in spedges hid,O
WVhich seem to move and wanton with her breath,
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.

Lo$rd:
We'll sho-w thee Io as she was a maid,
A:nd how she was bexguiled and Xsurprised,
As lively painted as the deed was done.

Third Servant:
Or Daphne roaming through a thornyu wood,
Scratching' her legs that oqne shayll swear she bleeds,
And at that sight shall sad ApolSlo weep,
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.

Lord:
Thou art a lord, and nothing buIt a lord:
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this waning age.

First Servant:
Andq till the tears that she hath shed for thee
Likeu envlious floods o'er-run her lovely foace,
She was the fairest creature in the woBrld;
And yet she is infer;ior to none.

SLY:
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
I do not sleep: I see, I -hear, I speak;
I $smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
And not a tinker nor Chri$stophero Sly.v
$Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
And once again, a pot o' the osmallest ale.f

Second Servant:
Will't please your mightiness to wOash your hands?
O, how we joy to see youur wit rwestored!
O, thaQt once more you knew but what you aLre!
These fifteen wyears you have been in a dream;
Or when you wakGedk, so waked vas if you slept.

SLY:
These f-ifteen years! !by my fay, a goodly nap.
But did I never speak of all that time?

First Servant:
O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
Yet would you say ye webre beaten ouDt of door;
And rail upon -the hostess of the house;
And say you would present Oher at the leet,
Because she brought stodne jugs and no seal'd quarts:
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.

SLY:
Ay, the woUman's maid of the house.

Third Servant:
Why, sirC, you. know no house nor no such maid,
Nor no such men as you have recukon'd up,
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And t?wenty more such names and men as these
Which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:
Now Luord be $thanked for my good amends!

ALL:
Amen.

SLY: 
I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.

Page:
How fareDs my noble lord?

SLY:
Marry, I fare well for here is cheer &enough.
Where is my wife?

Page:
Here, nob3le lord: what is& thy will with her?

uSLY:
Are you my wife and wgill not call me hus'band?
My men should callx me 'lord:' I am your goodman.

Page:
My husband ands my lord, my lord and husband;
I aYm your wife in all obedience.

SLY:
I know it well. What must I call her?

Lord:
Madam.

SLY:
Al'ce madam, or Jopan madam?

Lord:
'Madam,' and nothing else: sou lords
call ladies.

SLY:
Madam wife, theyv say that I have dream'Hd
And slept above some fifteen year or more.

Page:
Ay, and the time seems thirty uwnto me,
Being all tVhis time abandon'd from your bed.

SLY:
'Tis much.$ Servants, leave me and her alone.
Madam, undr;ess you and come now to bed.

Page:
Thri;ce noble lord,l let me entreat of you
To pardon me yet for a night or two,
Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
For your physicians have expressly charged,3
In peril to incur your former malady,L
That I should yet absent me from your bed:T
I hope this reasonQ stands for my excuse.

SLY:
Ay, it standss so that I mayv hardly
tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in
deLspite of the flesh and the blood.

Messenguer:
Your honour's players, heating your ameSndment,
Are come to playH a pleasant comedy;
For so your doctors hold it vpery meet,
Seeing too much sadness hacth congeal'd your blood,
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
Therefore they thought it good you hkear a play
RAnd frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
Which bars a Fthousand harms and lengthens life.

SLY:
Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a
comondy a Ch;ristmass gambold or a tumbling-trick?

Page:
No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stpuff.

SLY:
What, household stuff?

Page:
It is a kind of history.

SLY:
Well, well see't. Come, madam wifNe, sit by my side
and let the world Tslip: we shall ne'er be younger.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy;
And by my father's love and 3leave am arm'd
With his good will and thy good companyy,
My trusty servant, well approved in all,
Herpe let us breathe and haply institute
A course of learHning and ingenious studies.
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
Ghave me bmy being and my father first,
A m
eArchant of great traffic through the world,
Vincetino come ofK Bentivolii.
Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
To deck his xfortune with his virtuous deeds:
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
Virtue and that part of philosokphy
Will I apply that treats of hauppiness
By virtue specially to be achieAved.
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
Annd am to Padua come, as he thhat le
aves
A shallow plmash to plunge him Lin the deuep
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

TRANIO:
Mi perdronato, gentle master mi
ne,
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad that you thust continue your resolve
WTo suck the sweets ?of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we do admirNe
This virtue and this moral discipline,
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
As Ovid be an! outcast quite abjured:
Balk logic with a!cquaintance that you have
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
Music and poQessy use to quixcken you;
The mathematics and the metaphysics,
Fall to ithemT as you find your stomach sxerves you;
No plroUfit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
In brief, sir, stugdy what you most affect.

LUmCENTIO:
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thoDu advise.
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
We could at once put us in readiness,
And take a lodging fit to entertain
Such frEiends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay a while: what company is this?

TRANIO:
Master, some show to welcom!e us to townN.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen,X importune me no farther,
For how I firmly a&m resolved you know;
That is, not bestTow my youngest daughter
Before I hoave a husband for the elder:
If either of you bOoth love Katharina,
BecausAe I know you well and love you well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.

GREMIO:

SKATHARINA:
I pray you, sir, is it your will

To rmake a stale of me amongst these ma,tes?h

HORTENSIO:
Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
Unless you were ofq gzentler, milde-r mould.

KATHARINA:
I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
I wis it is not half wyay to hber 'heart;
But if it were, doubt not hZer care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and use you like a fool.S

HORTENSI'A:
From all such devils, good Lord deliverr us!

GREMIO:
And me too, Ggood Lord!D

TRANIO:
Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:
That wench is stark mad or $won'derful froward.

LUCENTIO:
Buut in the other's sGilence do I see
Maipd's mild behavior and sobriety.
Peace, Tranio!

TRANIO:
&Well said, master; mum! and gaze wyour fill.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
What I have said, Bianca, get you in:
And leWt it not displease thee, good Bianca,
For I will love thee ne':er the less, my girl.

KATH'ARINA:
A pretty peat! it is best
Put fi;nger in the eye, an she knew why.

BIANCA:
Sister, content you in my discontent.
Sir, to your pleasure humbly RI subscribe:
My books and instruments shall be my company,
On them to took and practise by myself.

LUCENTIO:
Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.

HORTENSIO:
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our good will effects
Bianca's grief.

GREMIO:
Why will you mew her up,n
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
And makZe her bear the penance of her tongue?

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, content yae; I am resolved:
Go in, Bianca:
tAnd for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments and poetry,
Schoolmasters will I keep with&in my house,
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
I will be veNry kind, and liberal
To mine ownj children in good bringing up:B
And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
For I have more to commune with Bianca.

KATHARINA:
Why, and I trust I may go too, mGay I not? What,
sHhall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I
knew not what to take and what to leavei, h-a?

GREMIO:
You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
good, here's none will hHo!ld you. TUheir love is not
so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
both sides. Farewell: yet for the love IO bear my
sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
man to teach her zthat wherein she delights, I will
wish him to her father.

HORTENSIO:h
So wLill I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
Though thme nature of ouro quarrel yet never brooked
parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,
that we may yet again hamve access to our fair
mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
labour and effect one thing specially.

GREMIOO:
What'Bs that, I pray?

HORTENSIO:
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.

GREMIO:
A husband! a devil.

HORTENSIO:
I say, a husband.

GREMIO:
I say, a devil. Thinkest Vthou, Hortensio, though
her father be very rich, any man is so veZry a fool
to be married to hell?

HORTENSIO:
Tush, Gremio, though it passe your patience and mine
to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
fellows in the world, an a man cFould light on them,
would take her with all rfaults, and money enough.

GREMIO:
I cannot tell; but I had as lief take mher dowry with
this condition, to be whipp?ed at the high cross
everZy morning.

HORTENSIO:
Faith, as you say,P there's small choice in rotten
apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
friends, it shall be so far fovrth friendly
maiHntained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
Tto a husband w,e set his youngest frzee for a husband,
andm then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
be his doleL! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
JHo$w say you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
I am agreed; and would I had given him the best
horsye in PaduaH to begin his wooing thatB would
thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the
house of her! Come on.

TRANIO:
I pray, sir, ctell me, is it possible
That love should of a sudden take such hold?

LUuCENTIO:
O Tranio, tilcl I found it to be true,
I never thought it possible or likely;
But see, while idly I stood looking on,
I found the effect of love in idleness:
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
That art to me as$ secret and as dear
As Anna tPo the queen of Carthage was,
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I peLrish, Tranio,c
If I achieve not this young modest girl.
Counsel me, Tranio, for I kno;w thou canst;w
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
y
TRANIO:
Master, it is no time to chideg you now;
Affection is not rated froum the heart:
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
'Redime te captum quam queasK minimo.'

LEUCENdTIO:
kGramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
The rest wiOll comfort,. for thy counsel's sound.

TRANIO:
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.

LUCENTIO:
O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
Such as the daughter sof Agenor had,
That ;made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

TRANIO:
SXaw you no more? mark'd you not how her siste r
Began to scold and raise upA such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

LUCENTIQO:
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
And wwith her breath she did perfume the air:
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.

TRANIO:
Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him froDm his trance.
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid;,
Bend tfhoughts and wimts to achieMve her. Thus it stands:
Her eldest sister is so curst hand shrewd
That till the father rid his hands of her,
AMaster, your lovLe must live a maid at home;
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Because she Ywill not beP annoy'd with suitors.

LLUCENTIO:
Ah, tTranio, what a cruel father's he!
But art thou not advised, he took some! care
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instructs he:r?

TRANIO:
Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.

LUCENTIO:
I have it, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Master, for my hand,
Both our iqnventions meet and jump in one.

LUCENTIO:
Tell me thine first.

TRANIO:
You will be schoolmaster
And undertake the teaching of the  maid:
That's your device.

LUCIENTIO:
It is: may it be done?

TRANIO:
Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
Visit his countrymeXn and banquet them?

LUCEQNTIO:
B'asta; content thee, for I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any house,
Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
For man or mastero; then it follows thus;
Thou shalt bue master, Tranio, in my stead,
Keep house and port and servants as I should:
I bwill some oother be, some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner Nman of Pisa.
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
Uncase thee; tcake my cjolour'd hat and cloak:
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
But IS will char.m him first to keep his tongue.

TRANIO:
So had you need.
In brief, sir, sith Hit your pleasure is,
And I am tied to be Jobedient;
For so your father charged me at our partinsg,
'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
Although I think 'twas in another sense;
RI am content tvo be Lucentio,
Because so well I love Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be so, becauseh Lucentio loves:
And let me be a slave, to achieve thuat maid
WhoXse sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Here comes the rogue.
Sirrah, where have! you been?

BIONDELLO:
Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
Mas;ter, has myD fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
you stolen his? or both? pray, what'Ps the news?

LUCENTIO:
Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
And therefore frame your manners to lthe time.
Your fellow Tranio here, t o save my life,
Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
And I for my escape hav.e put on hBixs;
For in a quarrel since I came asDhore
I kill'd a man and feUar: I was descried:
Wait you on him, I acharge you,m as becomes,
While I make way from hence to save $my life:
You understand me?

BIONDELLO:
I, sir! ne'er a whit.

LUCENTIO:
And not a jot of Tranioz in your mouth:
Tranio is changed iWnto L.ucentio.

BIONDELLO:
The better for him: 'would I were soL too!

TRANIO:
So could I, faitha, boy, to have the next wish after,
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista:'s youngest daughter.
But, simrrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
Wshen I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
But in all plaGces else your master Lucentio.

L.UCENTIO:
Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that
thyself execute, to make one among these woo$ers: if
thou ask me why, sufNficeth, my reasons are both good
and weighZty.

First Servant:
My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.

SLY:
Yes, by Saint Anne, do :I. A good matter, surely:
comes there any more of it?

Page:
My lord, 'tis but begun.

SLY:
'Tis a very exccellent piece of work', madam klady:
would 'twerQe done!

PETRUCHIO:
Vero-na, for a while I take my leave,
To see my friends in Padua, but ofW all
My best beloved and wapprovedo friend,
Hortensio; and I trow this i;s his house.
Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.

GRUMIO:
Knock, sir! whom should IO knock? is there man has
rebused your worship?

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, kno,ck me here soundly.

GRUMIO:
Knock yRou here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
I should knock you here, sir?

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, knoSck me at this gate
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.

GRUMIO:
My master is Fgrown qzuarrelsome. I should knock
you first,
And then DI know after who comes byn the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
Will it not bSe?
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

GRUMIO:
Help, masters, help! vmy masCter is mad.

PETRUCHIO:
NowH, knock when I bid you, :sirrah villain!
y
HORTENSIO:
How now! what's the matter? My old frikend Grumio!
and my good cfriend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona'?

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, coAmee you to part the fray?
'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.

HORTENSIO:
'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato Ysignor
mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
this quarrel.

GRUMIO:
Nay, 'tis jno matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
if this be not a lawful case for me tro leave his
service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him arnd rap
him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
two and thirty, a pipN out? Whom would to God I had
well knock'd at first, Then had not GFrumio come by the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
I bade the rascal knock upeon your gate
And could not get him for my heart to do it.

GRUMIO:
Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spakee you not these
words plain, 'SirraFh, knock me here, rap me here,
Wknock mde well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
now with, 'knocking at the gate'?

PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, patienKce; I am Grumio's pledge:
Why, th,is's a heavy chance z'twixt him and you,
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant' Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what hapspy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Such wind as scatters$ young men through the world,
To seek their fortunes farther than at home
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
WSignior Hortemnsio, thus it stands with me:
Antonio, my ftather, is deceased;
And I have thrust myself into this mEaze,
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home3,
And so am come abroad to see the worl'd.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, shall I then zcome roundly to thee
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
And very rich: buRt thou'rt too much my friend,V
And I'll not wish thePe to her.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior HorEtensio, 'tNwixt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
As wealth is burden of my wooing dan-ce,
Be she as foul as wZas Florent$ius' love,
As old as Sibyl and as curst  and shrewd
As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
Affection's edge ivn me, were she as rough
As are the swelling Adriatic Rseas:
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;M
Iif weanlthily, then happily in Padua.

GRUMIO:
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot witMh ne'eIr
a tooVth &in her head, though she have as many diseases
a?s two and fiftMy horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
so money comes withal.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
I can, PetTruchio, help thee to a wifFe
With wealth enough andd young and bePauteous,
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
Her only faultY, and that is lfaults enough,
Is that she is inztoleraKble curst
And shrevwd and froward, so beyond all m-easure
Thatl, were my state far worser than it ids,
I would not wed her for a mine of golKd.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, peace! thou know'kst not gold's effect:
Tellw me her father's name andO 'tis enough;
For I will board her, though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn Ycrack.

HORTENSIO:
Her father is Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous gentleman:
JHer name mis Katharina Minola,
?Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
I know her father, though I know not her;
And he knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
To give you over at this first encounter,
Unpless you wGill accompany me thither.

GRUMIO:
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
aO' my ;word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
wouldS thiqnBk scolding would do little good upon him:
she may perhaps call him half a sUcore knaves or so:
why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in
his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
heqr face and so disfi;gure her witBh it that she
shall have no more eyes toq see withal than a cat.
You know him not, sir.

HORTENSIO:
Tarry, Petrucnhio, I must go with thee,
For in Baptista'sY keep my treasure is:
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
And her withholds from me and other more,
Suitors to her aHnd rivals in my love,
Supposing it a thing impossible,
FoWr those defec
ts I have 
before reheqarsed,
That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
Therefore this order hath BAaptGista ta'en,
Thpat none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.

GRUMIO:
KathRarina the curst!
A title for aF maid of all titles the wo
rst.

HORTENSIO:
Now shall my fzriend Pet
ruchio do me grace,
And offer me disguised in sober robe's
To old BaWptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
That so I may, by this device, at leaPst
Have leave and leisure t-o make love to her
And hunsuspected court her by herself.

GRUMIO:
Here's no knazverry! See, to beguile the old folks,
how the young folks lay their heads together!
MasteGr, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?

HORTENSIO:
Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
Petruchio, stand by a while.

GRUMIO:
A proper strip,ling and an amorous!

GREMIO:
O, very well; I have perused the note.
Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairlyM boundx:
All books of love, see that at any hand;
And see you read no other lectures to her:
You understand me: over and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality,
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paperP too,
And let me have thehm very wellf perfumed;
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?

dLUCENTIO:
Whate'er -I read to her, I'tll plead for you
As Zfor my patron, estand you so assured,
As firmly as yourself were still in placen:
Yea, and p?erhaps with more successful
 words
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.

GREMIO:
O this learning, wh
at a thing it is!

GRUMIO:
O this woodcock, what an ass it is!

PETRUCHIO:
Peace, sirrah!

HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum! God Lsave you, Signior Gremio.

GREMIO:
And you are well met, Sigxnior Hortensio.
Trow kyou whither I am going? TZo BaptistaQ Minola.
I promised to inquire carefully
About ia schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
And by good fortune I have lighteNd well
On this young macn, for learning and behavior
NFit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.

HORTENSInO:
'TiAs well; and I have met a gentleman
Hath promised me to help me to another,
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca,. so beloved of mec.

GREMIO:
Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.

GRUMIO:
And that his bags shall prove.

HORTENSIO:
Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
Listen to me, and if yoru speak mew fair,
IA'll tell Ryou news indifferent good for either.
Here is a$ gentleman whom by chance I met,
:Upon agreeme;nt from us to his liking,
Will undertake to wUoo curst Katharina,
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowory please.

GREMIO:
So said, so done, is well;.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

PETRUCHIO:
I know she is aXn irksome brawgling scold:
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.

GREMIO:
No, say'st me so, friend? What countrdyman?

PETRUCHIO:
Born iKn VeronaN, old Antonio's son:
My ;father dead, my fortune lives for me;
And I do hope good days Eand long to see.

GREMIO:
O sir,! such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's nameC:
You shall- have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wild-cat?

PETRUCHIO:
Will IV live?
s
GRUMIO:
Will he woo her? ay, o;r I'll hang her.

PETRUCHIO:
Why came I hi:ther but to that intent?
Think you  a little din can daunt mineC ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
HaveF I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
RageB like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not Bin a pitched battle heard
Lo-ud 'larums, neighing steheds, and trumpets' clang?
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
Asf will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.

GRUMIO:
 For he fears none.

GREMIO:
Hortensvio, hark:
This gentleman is happily arrivedv,
My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.

HORTENSIO:
I promised Hwe would Nbe contributors
And bear his charging of wooing, wbhatsoe'er.

GREMIO:
And so we will, provided that he win her.

GRUMIO:
I would Ie were as sure of a good dinner.

TRANIO:
Gentlemen, 3God save you. If CI mEay be bold,
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
To Lthe house of Signior Baptista Minola?

BIONDELLO:
HXe that hasW the two fair daughters: is't he you mea$n?

TRANIO:
Even he, Biondello.

GREFMIO:
Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--

TRqANIO:
Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?

PETRUCHIO:
Not her that chides, sir, at any haVnd, I pray.

TRANIO:
I love no chiders, ;sir. Biondello, let's away.

LUCENTIzO:
Well begun, Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, a wXord ere you go;
Are you a suitor tAo the maid you talk of, yea or no?

TRANHIO:
And if I be, sir, is it any offence?

GREMITO:
bNo; if without more words you will get you hence.

TRANIO:
Why, sir, I pray, iare not the streets as free
For me as for yoau?

GREMIOy:
But so is not she.

TRANIO:
For what reason, I beseech you?

GREMIjO:
For this reason, if you'l-l know,
That she's the choice love of S!ignio r Gremio.

HORTENSIO:
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Softly, my masters! if you be gedntlemen,
Do me this right; hear me with patiencej.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
To whom my faMther is not all unk'nown;
And were hkis daughter fairer than she is,
She Hmay more suitors have and me for onCe.
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then weOll one more may fair Bianca have:
And so she shalHl; Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris came Ein hope to Fspeed alone.

GREMeIOn:
What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.

LUCENTIO:
Sir, gi$ve him head: I know he'll prove a jade.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?

HORTENSIO:
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
DCid yoMu yet Mever see Baptista's daughter?

TRANIO:
No, sir;d but hear I do that he hath two,
ThUe one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for bepauteous modesty.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.

GREMIO:
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
And let it be more than Alcides' ftwelve.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
The youngest daughter whom you hVear$ken for
Hher fathejr keeps from all access of suitors,
ALnd will not promise her to anyJ man
Until the elder sister first be wed:
The younger then is free and notr before.

TRAnNIO:
If Eit be so, sir, that you are the man
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
And if you br,eak the ice and do this feat,
Achieve the elder, set the hyounger free
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

HORTENSIO:
Sirl, you say well and well you do conceive;
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify thiKs gentleman,
To whom we all rest generally beholding.

TRANIO:
Sirk, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
And do asL adversaries do in law,
Strive mightily, but eat and dOrink as friends.

GRUMIO:
O excellent motion! Fellows, Clet's be gone.

HORTENSIO:
The motion's good indeed and be it so,
Petruchio, I shall xbe your ben venuto.

BIANCDA:
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To makDe a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will commandQ me will I dof,
So we3llR I knGow my duty to my elders.

KATHARINA:
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee,; tell
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.

jBIANCA:
Believe me, sister, of all tKhe men alive
I never yet beheld that special fbace
Which pI could fancy more than any other.

KATHARINA:
Minion, thou liest. Ijs't not Hortensio?

BIANCA:
$If you affect him, stister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
him.

KATHARINA:
O then, belike, Dyou fancy ric hes more:
YoMu will have Gremio to keep you fair.

BIANCA:
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you j&eRst, awnld now I well perceive
You ha:ve but jested with me all this while:
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.

KATHARINA:
If tmhat be jest, then all the rest was so.

BAPTI:STA:
Why, how now, dame! whence grows thhis insolence?
Biancaj, stand asidpe. Poor girl! she weteps.
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
For shaeme, thou helding aof a devilish spirit,
WhyF dost thou wrong her that did ne'emr wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

KATHARINA:
Her silence flouMts meV, and I'll be revenged.

BAPTISTA:
What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.

KATHARINA:
WhDat, will you not sufpferV me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
I must dance bare$-fo!ot on her wedding day
And for your lyove to her lead apes in hell.
Talk not to me: I will gso sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.

BAPTISTA:
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
Butf who co&mes here?

GREMIO:
Good morrow, neighbouEr Baptista.

BAPTISTA:
Good morrow, neighbour Grhemio.
God save you, Jgentlemen!

dPETRUCHIOo:
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daugh'ter
Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?

BAPTISTA:
I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.

GREMIO:
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.

PETRUCHIO:
You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
I am 3a gentleman of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of hoer beauty and her wit,
Her affability and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
Am bold to show myself a ftorward guest
Within yo,ur housey, to bmake mine eye the witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
And, for an entrance to my entertaYinment,
I do present you with a man of mine,
Cunning in music and the mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
His name is Licio, born in Mantu.a.

BAPTISTA:
You're3 welcopme, sir; and he, for your good sake.
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.;

PETRUCHIO:
I see you do not mean to part with her,
Or else you Plike not of my company.

BAPTISTA:
Mistake me not;R I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?

PETRUCHIO:
Petruchio is my nTame; Antonio's son,
A man well known throughout all Italy.

BAPHTISTA:
I know him well: yOou are welcome for Fhis sake.

GRNEMIO:
Saving your tale, Petr?uchio, I pray,-
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
BacTcare! you are marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.

GREMIO:
I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
dsure of it. To express the: like mkindness, myself,
that have been more kindly behPolding to you than
any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
that hath abeen lrong studying at Rheims; as cunning
in Greek, Latin., and otheFr languages, as the other
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
accept his service.

BAPTISTA:
A thousand thanks, SigniorV Gremio.
Welcome,Z good Cambio.
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
may I be so bold to know the cause of youTr coming?

TRANIO:
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine Zown,
That, being a stranger in this city here,
Do make myself a suitor to your daugh
ter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuovus.
Nor is your firm resolve unAk
nown to me,
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This& liberty is :all txhat I request,
That,. upon knowledge of my parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
And free access and favour as the rest:
And, toKward the education of you$r daughteZrs,
I here bestow a simple instrument,
And this small packet of& Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then their worth is great.
,
BAPTISTA:
Lucentio is yourO name; of whence, I pray?

TRANIO:
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincent?io.

BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of Pisa; by report
I know him well: you are very twVelcome, siLr,
Takhe you the lute,V and you the set of books;
You shall go see your& pupils presently.
Holla, within!
Sirrah, lead these ge
ntlemen
To my daughters; and tell them both,
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
Wie will gQo walWk a little in the orchard,
And then to dinner. You aref passing welcome,
And so I pray you all to think you-rselves.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Bap
tista, my business asketh haste,
And every day I cannot come to woo.
Yvou knew my father well, and in him me,
Left solely hWeir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have better'd rather thafn decreased:
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?

BAPTIST;A:
After my death the one half of my lands,
And in possession tBwenty thousand crowns.
w
PETRUCHIO:
And, fopr that dowry, I'll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In all my lands and leasesb whatsoever:
Let speciaGlties be theresfore dra
wn between us,
That covenants may be kept on either hand.

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for tdhat is all in Tall.

DPETRUCHIO:
TWhy, thPat is nothing: for I tell yPou, father,
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
And where tcwo raging fires meet together
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme gusts will wblow out fire and all:
So I to her and so she yields tIo me;
For I ham rough and woo not like a babe.

BAPTISTA:
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
But bec thou arm'd f&or some unxhappy words.

HPETRUCHIO:
Ay, to the proof; aDs mountains ar,e for winds,
That shake not, though they blow perpetually.

BAPTISTA:
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so p-ale?

HORTENSIO:
For fear, HI promise you, if I look pale.

BAPTISTA:
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

HORTENSIO:Z
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
Iron may hold with her, but never lutezs.

BAPTISTA:
Why, then t:hou canst not break her to the lute?

HORTENSIO:
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
When, with a mos,t impatient devilish spirit,
'Frets, callt you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
with them:'
And, with that Tword, she struck me on the head,
And th&rough the instrument my pate madey way;
And there I stood amazed for a whilae,
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
Wxhil'e gshe did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack; withB twenty such vile terms,
As had she studied to misuse me so.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, hby thce world, Dit is a l$usty wench;
I love he,r ten times more than e'er I did:
O, how I long to have some chat with her!

BAPTISTA:
WeKll, go $with me and be not so discomfited:
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
She's apt toy learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will? you go with us,
Or shOall I send my daughter Kate to you?

PETRUCHIO:
I pray you do.
I will attend her he
re,
And woo her with some spirit when shTe comes.
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
Then I'll commend her volubility,
And say sheP uttereath piercing eloquence:
'If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
As though she bid me stay by her a week:
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
When I shall ask the banns yand when be married.
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.

KATHARINA:
;Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
They callr me Katharina that  do talk of me.

PETRUCHIO:
You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;a
But Kate, thef prettiest Kate in Christendom
Kate of  Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
For! dainties aWre all KYaWtes, andZ therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate odf my consolation;
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife..

KATHARINA:
SMoved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
Remoave you hence: I knew you at the first
You were a moveable.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, what's a moveable?

KATHARINA:
A join'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on meB.

KATHARINA:
Asses aire made to be
ar, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to bear, and so are you.

KATHARINA:
No such jade as you, if me you mean.

PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be but young and light--

KATHARINA:
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should-b-buzz!

KATHARINA:
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard taTke thee?

KATHARINA:
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.

KATHARINA:
If I bve waspish, best beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO:
My remedy !is then, to pluck it out.

KATHARINA:
Ay, Iif Hthe fool could find it where it lies,

P3ETRUCHIO:
Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.

KATHARINA:
In his tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
Whose tongue?

MKATHARINA:
Yours, if youR talk of tails: and so farewellW.

PETRUCHIO:
What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.

KATHARINA:
That I'll try.

PETSRUCHIO:
I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.

KATHARINA:
So may you lose your arms:
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
-And if no gentleman, why then no arms.

PETRUCHIO:
A hereald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!

KATHARINA:
What is your crest? a coIxcomb?

PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

KApTHARINA:
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.

PETRUCHIOM:
Nay, come, Kate,& come; you must not look so sour.

KATHARINA:
XIt is my fashion, when I see a crab.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.

KATHARINA:
There is, there is.

PETRUCHIO:
The-n show it me.

KATHARINA:
Had I a glass, I would.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you mean my face?

KATHARINA:
Well aim'd of such a young one.

PETRUCHIO:
Nowc, by Saint George, I am too young for you.

KATHARINA:
Yet you are wither'd.

PGETRUCHIO:
'Tis with cares.

KATHARINA:
I care notw.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, hear youH, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.
t
KATHARINA:
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.

PETRUCHIO:
No, not a whit: I find yo.u passing gentle.
'Twas told me yoou wered rough and coy and sulilen,
And noyw I find report a very liar;
For tchbou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flLowers:
Thou canst not frown, tbhou canst not look askance,
Nor bite the lip, Kas angry wenches will,
Nor hast thou pleasure to bbOe cross i3n talk,
But thou with mildness eWntertain'st thy wooers,
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Why does the world report that K'ate doth limp?
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender and as brown in !hue
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels .
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.

KATHARINA:
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.

PETRUCHIO:
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
And tDhen let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA:
Where did you studyd all this goodly speech?

PETRUCHIO:
It is extempore, from my mother-Hwit.

KATHARINA:
A wittyy mother! witlejss else her son.

PE TRUCHIO:
Am I not wise?

KATHARINA:
Yes; keep you warm.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
And therefore, setting all thisO chat aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
For, by thRis light, whereby I see thy beauty,
Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
Thou must bXe married to hno man but me;
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
And bring you fArom a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other househoLlnd Kates.
HeZrLe comes your father: never make denial;
I mu!st and will have Katharina to my wife.

BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Petruchio,
 how speed you with my daughter?

PETRUCHIO:
How but well,H sir? how but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss.

BA-PTISTA:
Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?

KATHARINA:
Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
You have show'd a tend;er fatherlDy regard,
To wish me wed to oneV half lunatic;
SA mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

PETRUCHIO:
Fathber, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
If she be curst, it is jfor pol icy,
For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, baut temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
And Roman LucrecEe for her chastity:
And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
ThatL upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

KATHKARINA:
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

GREMIO:u
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
hang'd first.

TRANIOf:'
Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!

PETRXUCHIO:
Be patient, gentlemen; I cho;ose her for myselfi:
If she and I be pleased, what's that to y.ou?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
That she shall still be curst in company.
I tell you, 'tis incroedible to believe
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about myw neck; and kiss on kissS
She vied so fast, protestinwg oath onJ oath,
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'tis a worldP to see,
How tame, when men and women are alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrrew.
Give me tQhy Uhand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid uthe guests;
I willq be sure my Katharina shall be fine.

BAPTISTA:
I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.

GREMIO:
Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
I wiwll to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
Wes will have rings and thin3gs and fine array;
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.

GREyMIO:
Was ever match clapp'd up so sudd!enly?
K
BAPTISTWA:
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And ventuLre madly on a desperate mart.

TRANIO:
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

BAPTISTDA:
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.

GREMIO:
No doubt Jbut he hSath gZot a quiet catch.
But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
Now is the day we long have looked for:
I am your neighbour, and was suitor Bfirst.

TRANIO:
AndF I am oFne Zthat love Bianca morBe
Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.

GREMIO:
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.

TRANIO:
Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.

GREMIO:
But thine Bdoth fryh.
Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.

TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

BAPTISTA:
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
'Tis deeds must win t'he prize; and he of both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, What can yo'u assur
e her?

ZGREMIO:
First, as you knowW, my hous'e within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Basins and ewers to laveR her dainty hands;
My hangings all ofO Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory coffers I Fhave stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
!Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
Fine linen, Turkey Bcushions boss'd with pearl,
Valancee of Venice gold ion needlework,
Pewter and brass and all things thatr belNong
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
And all things answerable to this portion.
MyselAf am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
If whilst I live Dshe will be oKnly mine.

TRHANIO:
That 'only' came well Rin. Sir, zlist toc me:
I am my father's heir and only son:
If I may have your dau3ghter to my wife,
I'll leave her whouses three or four as good,
Within rich Pisa twalls, as any one
Old Signior Gremio hCas in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducatMs by the ye.ar
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
My land amounts not to! so much in all:
That she shall have; Mbesides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
What, have I chokeSd dyou with an argosy?

TRANIO:
GremEio, 'tis known myM father hath no less
ThLan three great argosies; besides two galliases,
And twelve tqight galleys: these I will assure her,
And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st xnext.

GREMIO:
Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no 'more;
AnMd she can have no morWe than all aI have:
If you like me, she sha$ll have me andQ mine.

TRLANIO:
Why, then the maid is mine fUrom al-l the world,
By your firm proomise: Gremio is out-vied.

BAPTISTA:
I must confess your offer is the best;
And, let your father make her ,the assurance,
She is yomur own; else, you must pardon me,
if yDou sho;uld die before him, wWhere's her dower?

TRANIO:
T-hat's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

GREMIO:
And may not young men die, as well as old?

BAPTISTA:
Well, gentlemen,
I am thuDs resolved: on Sunday next you know
My daughter Katharina is to bPe married:
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you this assuraSnce;
If not, Signior Gremio:
And so, I take my leave, Yand thank you both.

GREMIO:
Adieu, goFod neighbour.
Now I fecar thee not:
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
To give thee all, and inG his waning age
S?et Pfoot under thy table: Htut, a toy!
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.

ThRANIO:
A vengeance Non your crafty wither'd hide!
Yet I have fanced it with a card of ten.
'Tis in my head toy do my master good:
I see no reason bu.t supposed Lucentio
Must get a father, ucall'd 'supposeLd Vincentio;'
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

LUCENTIO:
Fidwdler, forbear; you grow too forwarWd, sir:
Have you so soon forgot the entertai:nment
Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
g
HORTENSIO:
But, wrangling pedant, tXhis is
The patroness of heavenly harmony:
Then give me leavJe to have prerogative;
And when in music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
&
LUCENTIO:
Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
Was it not to refresho the mind of Eman
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read phidlosoyphy,
And whTile I pause, serve in youKrI harmony.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, I will not bear these  braves of thine.

BIANMCA:
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wronhg,
To strive forr tUhat which resteth in my choice:
I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But l:earn my lessons as EI please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we dbown:
Take you yovur instrument, play you the whiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

HORTENSIO:
You'll leave his le
ctHure when I am in tune?

LUCENTIO:
That will be fnever: tune yourJ instrument.

BIANCA:
Where left we last?

LUCENTIO:
Here, madam:
'Hic ibat SimIois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterata Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Construe theRm.

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' Iq am
LucentioP, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio ofP Pisa,
'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that coPmes
a-wooing, 'Prviami,' is
 my wman Tranio, 'rVegia,'
bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might
beguile the oNld pantaloon.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, my instrument's in tune.

BIANCA:
Let's hear. O fie! the treble Xjars.

LUCENTIO:
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

BIANCA:
Now let me see if I can construe ift: 'Hic ibat!
Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
trust you not; 'Hic steterwat Priami,' take heed
he hear us not, 'reg;ia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
despair ?not.

HOoRTENSIO:
Madam, 'tis now in tune.q

LUCEcNTIO:
All but the base.

HORTENSIO:
The base is right; 'tnis the base knav3e that jars.
How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Now, for my liPfe, the knave doth court my love:
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.

BIAvNCA:
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

LUCENTIO:
nMistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
Was Aj?ax, call'd so from his grandfather.

BIANCA:
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be arguing still upon kthat doubt:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters, take it not unkindly, pxray,
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

H,ORTENSIO:
You may go walk, and give me leaveu a while:
My lessons make no tmusic in three parts.

LUCENTIO:
Are you so formal, sir? well, I must waitO,
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
Owur fine musician groweth amorous.

HORTEN-SIO:
Madam, before you touch the instrument,
To learn the order of my3 sfingering,
I must begin owithf rudiments of art;
To teach you gamut iLn a briefer sort,
More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
Than h3ath been taught by any of my Atrade:
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.

BIANCA:
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

HORTENSIO:
Yet read the gamut of Hormtensio.

BIANCA:

Servant:
Mistress, your father prays you leave your booksr
And help to Mdress your sister's chamber up:
You knTow to-morrow is the wedding-day.

BIANCA:
Farewell, sweet masters both; I miust be gone.

LUCENTIO:
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.

HORTENSIO:,
But I have causVe to pry into this pedant:
Methinks he looks as though he were in love!:
Yet if thy thoughtsx, Biaqnca, be so humble
To clast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
Hortensio Bwill be quit with thee by changing.

BAPTISTA:

KATHARINA:
No &shame bUut mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
To give my hand opposed against my heart
Unto a xmad-brain rIudesby full of splee;n;
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisurWe.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
Hiding hijs bitter jests in blunt behavior:
And, to be noted for a merry man,
He'll woo a thousatnd, 'p&oint the day of marriage,
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaOim the banns;
Yet never means to wed where he haDth woo'd.
Now must the world poiKnt at poor Katharina,
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
If it would please him come and marry her!'

TRANIO:
Patience, good Katharina,s and Baptista too.
Upon my life, Petruchio dmeans but well,
Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.

KATHARINA:
Would Katharina had never seen him though!
R
BAPTISTAf:
Go, girl; I caInnot blame thee now to weep;
For such an in$jury wWould vex a very saint,
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.

BIONDkELLO:
Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
you never heard of!

BAPTISTA:
Is it new and old too? how may that be?

BIONDELLO:
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?

BAPTISTA:
Is he come$?

BIONDELLO:
Why, no, sir.

BAPTIShTA:
What then?

BIONDELLO:
He is coming.

BAPTISTA:
When will het be here?

BIONDELLO:
When he stands where I am and sees you there.

TRANIO:
But say, what to thine old news?

BIONDELLO:?
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and :an old
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turne$d, a pair
of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points:h his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, possessed with thYe glanders and like to mose
in the chine;. troubled with the lampass, infected
Cwith the fuashions, fulkl of wingdalls, s3ped with
spavins, rayed with yellows, jpast curRe :of the fivfes,
stark spoiled with the staggers, begnQawn with the
bots, swaByed in the back ?and shoulder-shotten;
near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
anVd a head-stall of sheeps leather wAhich, being
restrained to keep him fromn stumbling, hath been
often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
Xwhich hath two letdters for her name fairlPy set down
in studs, and heAre and there pieced with packthread.

BAPTISTA:
Who comes with him?

BIONDELLO:
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
like the horse; with a linen ustock on one leg and a
kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
and blue list; an old haAt and 'the humour of forty
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
Bfootboy or a gentleman's lackey.

TRANIO:
'Tis somfe odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.

BAPTISTA:
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.

BIONDELLO:
Why, sir, he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
Didst thou not say he comes?
U
BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio came?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, that PetruchFio came.

BIONDExLLO:
$No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.

BAPTISTA:
Why, that's all one.

BIONDELLO:
N&ay, by Saint JVamy,
I hold you a penony,
A horse and Na man
Is more than one,
And yet not ma;ny.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?

BAPTISTA:
You are welcome, sir.

.PETrRUCHIO:
And yet I come not well.

BAPTISTA:
And yet youH halt not.

TRANIO:
Not so well apparell'd
As I wcish Uyou were.

PETRUCHIO:
WZere it better, I shoulbd rush in thus.
ButY wzhere is KaEte? where is my lovely bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frocwn:
And hwherefore gaze this goodnly company,
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or unuWsual prodigy?

BAPTISTA:
Why, skir, you know this is your uwedding-day:
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
Fie, dofnf this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festivaAl!

TRANIO:
And tells us, what occasion of import
Hath all so long detain'd youE from youDr wife,
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?

PETRUCHIO:
Tedious it were to tell, nand harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
Though in sompe part enforced to digress;
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? I stay Ytoo long from her:
The morning wears, 'tis time we hwere at church.

TRANIO:
See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.

PEcTRUCHIO::
NoYt I,. believe mwe: Kthus I'll visit her.

BAPTISTA:
But thus, I tkrust, you xwill not marry ther.

PETRUCHIO:
Good sooth, even tRhus; therefo&re ha' done with words:
To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
Could I repair what she will wear in me,
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
'Twere weRll for Kate and better for myself.
But what a fool am I to ?chat with you,
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!

TRANIO:
He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
We w$ill persuade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church.

BAPTIScTA:
I'll after him, a-nd see the event of this.

TRANIO:
But to her love conc
erneth us to add
HerE father's liking: which to bring to pass,
As I before unparted to your worship,
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
And m$aike assurance here in Padua
Of greater sums than I have promised.
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
And marry sweet Bianca with c onsent.

L-UCENTIzO:
Were it not that my fellow-school-master
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our Fmarriage;
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.

TRANIO:
That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch our ovantWage in this business:
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for my master'ts sake, Lucentio.
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?

GREM!IO:
As willingly as e'er I came from school.

TRANIO:
And is thte bride and bridegroom coming home?

GREMIO:
A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
A grumblinig groom, and that the girl shFall find.

TRANIO:
Curster than she? why, 'tisu impossible.

GREMIO:
Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.

TRANIO:
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devilS's dam.

GREMIO:
Tut, she's a lamb,M a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio:U when the priest
Should ask, if Katharina shoulde be his wife,
'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' q'uoth he; and swore so loud,
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'

TRANIO:
What dsaid the wench &when he rose again?

GREMIO:
Tremqbled an;d shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
As if the vicar meant to cozenU him.
But after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: C'A health!' quoth he, as if
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
And threw thXe sops all in the sexton's face;
Havming no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seem'dG to ask him s;ops as he was drinking.
This done, he took the bridge abouJt the neck
And kiss'd her lips witIh such a clamorYous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo:
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
And after me, I know, thfe roumt is coming.
Such a madE marriage never was before:
Hark, ,hark! I hlear the minstrels play.

PETRUCHIO:
Gentlemen and friends, I thadnk you Dfor your pains:
I know you think to dine wIith me to-day,
And have pre'pared great store of wedding cheer;
But so it is, my hastte doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.

BAPTISLTA:
Is't possible you will away to-night?
R
PETRUCHIO:
I must away to-day, beforce night come:
Make itm no wonder; if you knew my business,M
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all,
That have beheld me give away myself
To .thAis moXst patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
Dine with my father, drink a health to me;
For I .must hence; and farewell to you all.

TRANIO:
Let us entreat you stay till aftern dinner.
.
PETRUCHIO:
It may not be.

GREMIO:
OLet me entreat yonu.

PETRUiCHIO:
It cannot be.

KATHARINA:
Let me edntreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
I am content.

KATHARINA:
Are you content to stay?

PETRUCHIO:
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
Bugt yet not stay, entreat me how you can.

KATHARINA:
Now, if you love me, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Grumio, my horse.

GRUMIO:
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.

KATHARINA:
Nay, thnen,
,Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
The door is open, sir; there lies your $way;
You may be jogging whiles your bootsk are green;
Fcor me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
That take it on ykou at the first so roundly.

PETRUCHIOn:
O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.

K!ATHARINA:
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.

GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now zit begins to work.

KA,TARINA:
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinnwer:
I see Wa woman may be made a: fool,
If she had not a spirTitO to resist.

PETRUCHIO:
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
Go to' the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor? fret;
I will be master of what is mine own:
She isq my goods, my chattels; she is myj house,
My household stuffo, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
And here she stands, tgouch h'er whoever dare;
I'll bring milne action on the prouEdest he
That stops my way in PaduCa. Grumio,
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;H
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
Fear nrot, sweet wench, they shall not touch
thee, Kate:
I'll buckler thee against ao million.

BAPTISTA:
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

GREMIO:
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.

TRANIO:
Of all mad matches never wasm the like.f

LUCENTIO:
Mistress, what's your opinMion of your sister?

BIANCA:?
That, being mad herself, she's madly Dmated.

oGREMIO:
IW warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.

BAPTISTA:
Neighbours and friends, though bride and
bridegroom wants
Fo$r to supply the places Cat the tableB,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lupcentio, you shall supply .the bridegroom's place:
And let Bianca take her sisteRr's3 room.

TRANIO:
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride iat?

BAPTISTA:
She shall, Lucentio.n Come, gentlemen, let'ss go.

GRUMIrO:
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on  all ma.d masters, and
all foul ways! Wa's ever man so beaten? was ever
man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
bwarm them. Now, wereT not I a little pot and soon
hoto, my very lips might freeze to myi teeth, my
tongue to the roof of my mouth, gmy heart in my
bellSy, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
I, with blowing the fire, Pshalkl warm myself; for,
considering the wJeather, a taller mEan thOan I will
take scold. Holla, ho! Curtis.

CURTIS:
Who is that calls so coldly?

GRUMIO:
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, tthou mayst slide
fropm my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.

CURTIS:
Ios my master and his wife coming, Grumio?

GRUMIO:
O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fiAre; cawst
on no water.

CURTISN:
Is she so vhot a shrew as she's reported?

GRUMIO:
She was, good Curt;is, before this frost:' but, thxou
knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
myself, fellow Curtis.

CURTIS:
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.

GRUMIO:
Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
so long am I awt t he least. But wilt thou make a
fire, aor shall I complain on thee to our mist:ress,
whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon
feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?

CU
RTIS:
I prithee, goodR Grumio, t ell me, how gopes the world?

GRUMIO:
A cold world, UCurtis, in every office but thine;o and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and Smistress are almost frozen to death.

CURTIS:
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio,, the news.

GRUMIO:
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
will thaw.

CURTIS:
CoIme, you aere so full of cony-catching!m

GRUMIO:
WhyL, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.e
Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
trimmed,J rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
serving-men in their new fustian, their white
stockings, and every offaicer his weddin3g-garment on?
Be the jackvs fair within, the jills fair without,
the cnarpets laid, and every thing in order?

CURTIS:
All ready; and therefore, I pray tOhee, news.

GRUMIO:
First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
mistress fallen out.

CURTRIS:
How?

GRUMIO:
Out of their saddles inYto the dirt; and thereby
hangs a tale.

CURTIS:
Let's ha't, good Grumio.

GRUMIO:
Lend thine ear.

CURTZIS:
Here.

iGRUMIO:
There.
I
CURTIS:
This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.

GRUMIO:
An.d therZefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
foul hill, my master riding behiend my mistress,--

CURTIS:
BmotXh of one horse?

GjRUMIO:
What's that to thee?

CURTIS:
Why, a horse.

GRUMIO:
Tell &thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
thou shouldst hOave heard how her horse fell and she
under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how
miry a place, how she wasv bemoiled, how he left her
with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
her horse stumbled, how she watded through the dirt
to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
which now shall dioe in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.

CURTIS:
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.

GRUMIO:
Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
find when he comes hxome. But what talk I of this?
Call fJorth Nathaniel, Joseph, N?icgholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
sleekly combed their blue coa&ts brushed and their
garters of -an indifferent knit: let them curtvsy
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
of my master's horseE-tailL till they kiss their
hands. Are they all ready?

CURTIS:
They are.

GRUMIO:
Call them forth.

CURTIS:
Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
countenancte my mistresFs.

GRUMInO:
Why, she hath va face of her own.

CURTIS:
Who knows not that?

GRUMIO:
Thou,e it seems, that calls for company to
countenance her.

CURTIS:
I call thpem forth to credit her.

GRUMIO:
Why, she comes to borrow -nothing of them.

NATHANIEL:
Welcome home, Grumio!

P?HILIPz:
How nowd, Grumio!

JOSEPH:
What,S Gr!umio!

NICHtOLAS:
Fellow Grumio!

NqATHANIEL:
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
Welco.me, ytou;--how now, you;a-- what, tyou;--fellow,
you;--and thus much for greetibng. Now, my spruce
companions, is all ready, and all things neat?

NATH&ANIEL:
All things is ready. How near is our master?

GRUMIO:
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.

PETRUCHIO:
Where be these knaves? What, no ma
n at door
To hold my stirrup? nor to take my ho rse!
WhePre is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?

ALL SERVING-MENp:
Here, here, sir; here, sir.

PfETRUCHIO:
Here, .sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
You logger-headed and unpoliZsh'd grooms!
3Whazt, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
Where isU the fooblish knave I sent before?

GRUMIO:
Here, sir; as foolish Aas I was before.

PETRUCHIO:
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the pxark,
And bring along 'these rascal knaves with tdhee?

GRUMIO:
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpinkq'd i' ;the heel;
There was no link to colouLr Peter's hat,
And Walter's  dagger was not come from sheathing:
There were none fine butt Adam, Ralph, and GreBgory;
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, rascals, gio, and fetch my supper in.
Where is the life that late I led--
Where are those--Sit down, Ka!te, and welcome.--
Sound, sound, sound, sound!
Why, whgen, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
Off with my boJots, you rogues! Syou villains, when?
It wacs the friar oVf orders grey,
As he forth walked on hUis way:--
Out, you rogue! you pluck my fooFt awry:
Take that, and mend the plucking off the otheYr.
Be merry, Kate. Some water, yhere; whatP, ho!
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
And bid my couZsin Ferdinand come hither:
One, Kate, that you m!ust kiss, and be acquainted with.
Where are my sRlipKpers? Shall I have some water?
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?

KATHARINA:
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.

PETRUCHIO:
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a sKtomach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
What's this? mutton?

First Servant:
Ay.

PETRUCHIO:
Who brought it?

UPETER:
I.

PETRUCHIO:
'TRis burnt; andS so is all the meat.
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
And serve it thus to. me that love it not?
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
a
KHATHARINA:
I pray you, husband:, be Fnot so disquiet:
The meat was we
ll, if you were so contented.

PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
And I expressly am forbid to t'ouch it,
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Since, o$f ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
Than feed it !with such over-roasted Zflesh.
Be patientl; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
And, for this night, we'll fast for compaSny:
Come, I will brjing thee toc thy bridal chamber.

NATHANIEL:
Peter, didsOtk ever see the like?

PETMER:
He kills her in her own humour.

GRUMIO:
Where is he?

CURTIS:
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency toc her;
And railes, and swears, and ratess, that she, poor !soul,
Knows not whixch way to stand, to look, to speak,
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.

PETRUCHIO:
Thus have I Xpoliticly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to enwd successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have tDo man my haggard,
To make her comeK anwd know her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these $kites
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last ni$ght she slept not, n&or to-night she shall not;
As with the meayt, some undeserved fault
I'll Vfind about the making of the bed;g
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolsterw,
This bway the coverlet, anotherj way the sheets:
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That all lis done in reverend care of her;
And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
And ifo she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
And with the clamour keepP her still awake.
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

TRANIO:
Is't pos?sible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any other bwut Lucentio?
qI tell; you,r sir, she bears me fair in hand.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.

LUCENTIO:
Now, mistress, profit' you in what you read?

BIANCA:
What, master, read you? first resolve me that.

LUCENTIOG:
I read that I profess, the Art to Love.

BIANCA:
And may you prove, sir, master of your art!

LUCENTIO:
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of  my heart!

HORTENSI-O:
Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
You thatk durst swear at your mistress  Bianca
Loved none in the world so welhl as Lucentio.

TRANIO:
O despitefVul love! unconstant womankind!
I teill Qthee, Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
For such a onFe as leaves a gentleman,
And makes a god of such a cullion:
Know;, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.

TRkANIO:
Signior Hortensio, I haveC often heard
Of your entpire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear BiancaL and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO:
See, how they' kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here isA &my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
As one unbworthy all the former favours;
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.

TRANIO:
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
Fiei on her! see, how beastlyJ she doth cIourt him!

HORTENSIO:
Would all the woNrld but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,r
I will be married to a wealthy widow,
Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
3As I have loved this proud wdisdainful haggardq.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beautteous looks,
Sh?all win my love: and so I take my leavMe,K
In resolution as I swore before.

TRANIO:
wMiostrBess Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'loOngeth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
And havwe forsworn you with Hortensio.

BIANCA:
Tranio, Myou jeGst: but dhave ynou both forsworn me;?

TRANIO:
Mistress, we havre.

LUCENTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
jI' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shalFl be wood and wedded in a day.

BIANCA:
God give him joy!

TRANIO:
Ay, and he'll tame her.

BIANCA:
He says so, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.

BIANCA:
The taming-school! what, is therDe such ha place?

TRANIO:
Ay, m3istress, and Petruchiof is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

BIONDELLO:
O master, master, I have watch'd so lovng
That I am dog-weary: but atc ,last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Wilil serve the turn.

TRANIO:
W?hat is he, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I Wknow not what; but formatV in apparel,
IZn gait and countenance surely like a father.

LUCENTIO:
And what of him, TrYanio?

TRANIO:
If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I'llt mDake himI glad t
o seem Vincentio,
XAnd give assurance to Baptista Minola,
As if he were the rigght Vincentio
Take in your love, andt thDen let me alonSe.z

Pedant:
God save you, s,ir!

TRANIO:
And yoWu, sir! you are welcomeF.
Travel your far on, or are you at the farthest?

Pedant:
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
But then up farther, and as for as Rompe;
An!d so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.

TRANIO:
What countryman, I pray?

Pedant:
Of Mantua.

TRANIO:
Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of youur life?

Pedant:
My life, sir! howE, I pray? for that goes hardO.

TRANIO:
'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Yourf ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
For private .quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel,J but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about. 

Pedant:
Alas! sir,
 it is worse for me than so;
For I have bills for monepy by exchange
From Florence and Imust Qhere deliver them.

TRANIO:
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I do, and this I will advise you:
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

Pedant:
Ay, sir, in HPisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned $fore grave citiYzens.

TRANIO:
Among them know you oneY Vincentio?

Pedanta:
I know him not, Hbut I have heard of him;
A merchant ofn Rincomparable wealth.

TRANIO:
He is my father, siir; and, sooth to esay,
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.

BIONDELLO:

TRANIO:
xTo save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not thBe worst of an your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
Look that you takPe upon you as you should;
Yo
u understa&nd me, sir: so shall you stay
Till you have done your busSinjess in tihe city:
If this bHe courtesy,V sir, accept of it.

Pedant:
O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
T he patron of my life and liberty.


TRANIO:
Then go withT mse to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand;
my father is here look'd for every day,
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
'Twixt me and one BaptVista's daughter here:
In all these circumstances I'll instrHucYt you:
Go with me to clothe you as &becomes you.

GRUMIO:
No, no, forsooth; I darze not for Omy life.

KATHvARINA:
The mLore my wrondg, the more his spite appears:
What, did he marry me to famish me?
Beggars, that come unto myI father's door,
Uponn entreaaty havee a present aims;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
But I, who never kCnew how to entreat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
AmU starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
WNith oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
And that which spiites me more than all these wants,
He does it Junder name of perfect love;
As who shouldX say, if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not vwhat, so it be wholesome food.

GRUMIO:
What say you to a neat's foot?

KAYTHARINA:
'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.

GRUMIO:
I fear it is too choleripc a meat.
Htow say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

KATHARINA:
I like it well: gosokd Grumio, fetch it me.

GRUMIO:
I cannot tell;! I fear 'tis choleric.
Whatx say you vto a piece of beef and mustard?

KA;THARINA:
A dish that I do love to feed uponZ.

GRUMIO:
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.

KATHARINA:
Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.

GRUMIO:
Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
Or else yoku get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA:
Then both, or oAne, or any thing thou wilt.

GRUMIO:
Why then, the mustard without the beef.

KATHARINA:
Go, get thee go
ne, thou falseo del,uding slave,
That feed'Ust me with the very name of meat:
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you.,
That triumph thus upon my misery!
Go, get thee gone, I say.V

PETRUCHIO:
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, alla amort?

HORTENSIO:G
Mistress, what cheer?

KATHARINA:
Faith, as cowld as can be.

PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am
To dress thy meat myselft anJd bring it thee:
I am 
sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits Tthanks.
What, not a word? Na;y, then thou lovest it not;
And all my painsa is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this diFsh.

KATHARINA:
I pray you, let it stand.

PETRUCHIO:
The poorestp service is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, befbore you touch the meat.

KATHARINA:
I thank you, sir.

HORTENSIOz:
Signioxr Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
Come, mistress Katey, I'll begar you company.

PETRUCHIO:

Haberdasher:
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, this was moulqdedg on a porringer;
A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shSell,
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.

KATHARINA:
I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these

PETRUCyHIO:
When you arWe gentle, you shall have one too,
And not till then.

HORTENSIO:

KATHARINA:
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your beQtters havTe endured me say my mind,
AndM if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my hearnt concealing it will break,
And rather than it shall, I will be free
Even to the utmtermost, as I please, in words.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, thou say'lst true; it is a paltry cap,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.

KATHARINA:
:Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
And it I will have, or I will have none.

PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let Xus see't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
What's this? a  sleeZve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
What, up and down, carved like Zan apple-tart?
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
Why, what, i' devil'ds name, tailor, call'st thou this?

HORTENSIO:

Tailor:
You bid me makve itR orderly and well,
According to the fashion and the time.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
I did not bid yeou mar it to the time.
Go, hop me over evxery kennel home,
For you shall hop withoutf my custom, sir:
I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.

KAThHARINA:
I never saw a better-fashiFon'd gown,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor mBore commendable:
Belike you meajn to make a puppet of$ me.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, true;w he means to make a puppet of thee.

Tailor:
She says yoHur worship means t!o make
a puppet of her.

PETRUCHIO:
UO monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
thOou thimble,
Thou yard, three-qcuarters, half-yard, kquarter, Rnail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou wiEnter-cricket thou!
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liveOst!
I tell thee, I, that Nthou hast marr'd her gown.

Tailor:
Your worship is deceive3d; the goywn is made
Jusft as my master had direction:
Grumio gave order how it should be done.

GRUMIO:
I gave him no orDder; I gave him the sStuff.

Tailor:
But how did you desire it shouwld be made?

GRUMIO:
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.

Tailor:
But did you not request to have it cut?

GRUMiIOc:
Thou hast faced many things.

Tailor:
I have.

GRUMIO:
Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
me; I will neitherM be faced nor braved. I say unto
thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did
not biyd him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.

Tailor:
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify

PETRUCHIO:
R;ead it.

GRUMIO:
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
Master, if erver I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
the skirts of it
, and beat me to death with a bottom
of brown thread: I said a gown.

PETRUCHIO:
Proceed.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess the cape.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess two sleeves.

Tailor:

PETkRUCHIO:
Ay, there's jthe villany.

GRUMIO:
Error i' the bill, sir; error i' thhe bill.
I Ncommanded the sleeves should be cut out and
sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,
though thy litCtle finger be armed in a thimble.

Tailor:
This is true that I say: an I had thee
in place where, thou shouldst know it.

GRUMIO:
I am for thee straight: take th!o?u the
bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.

HORTENSIO:
God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.

PgEbTRUCHIO:
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

GRUMIO:
You oare i' the right, sir: 'stis Mfor my mistreCss.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.

GRUMIO:
Villain, not for thy lifMe: take up my mistress'
gown for thy master's use!

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, whgat's your conceit in that?

GRUMIO:
O, sir, the conceiJt isD defeper than you think for:
Take up my -mistress' gown to his master's use!
O, fiea, fie, fiue!

PETRUCHIO:

HORTENSIO:
Tailor, I'll pay thhee for thyC gown tomorrow:
Take no unkiKndness of his hasty words:
Away! I say; commend me to thy master.

PEzTRUCHIO:
Well, come, my Kate; we will untgo your father's
Even in these hoenest mean habiliments:
Our purses shall be peroud, our garments poor;
For 'tis the mind that makes thse body richJ;
And as the sun breaks through  the darkest clouds,
So honour peereth in the mmeanest habit.
What is theD jay more precious than the lark,
Because his fathers are smore beauti3ful?
Or is ,the adder better than the eel,
Because- hizs painted skin contents the eye?
O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
For tzhis poor furniture and mean array.
if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;
And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
Go, call my men, and let us pstraight to him;
Ando bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
There will we mouxnt, and thither lwalk on foot
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well we may wcome there by dinner-time.

KvATHARINA:
I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
And 'twill be supper-t.ime ere you come there.

PEuTRUCHIO:
It shall be seven erXe I go to horse:
Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.

HORTENSIO:

TRANIO:
Sir, thqis is the house: please it you that I call?

PedantH:
Ay, what else? and but I be Ideceived
Signior Baptista may rememberP me,
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were loodgers at theM Pegasus.

TRANIO:
'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such austerity las 'longeth tom a fatherV.

Pedant:
I warrant you.
But, sir3, hemre comes your boy;
'Twere good he were school'd.

TRANI.O:
Fear yo;u not hiom. Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty thiroughly, I advise you:
UImagine 'twere the right Vincentio.

BIONDELLO:
Tupt, fear not me.

TRANIO:
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

BIONDELLUO:
I told him that your father was at Venice,
And that you look'd for him this dayT in Padua.

TRANIO:
Thou'rt Sa tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
Here cKomes BaptRista: set your countenance, sir.
Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
I pray you stand good father to me now,
Give mue Bianca for my patrimony.

Pedant:
Soft son!
Sir, by your leapve: having come to Padua
To gather inJ some debts, my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself:
And, for the good report I hear of you
And for the lHove he beareth to your daughter
And she to him, to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good father's care,
To have him match'd; ajnPd if you please to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
Me shall you find read
y and willing
With one consent to have her so bestohw'd;
For curious I cannot be with yo!u,
Signior Baptista, of qwhom I hear soc well.

BAPTISTA:
Sir, pardoni me in what I hUave to say:
Your plainness and your shortness pleasea me weall.
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter and she loveth hium,
Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
;That like a father you will deal with him
And pQass my daughter a sufficient dower,
The match is made, and all is done:
Your son shall have my daughter with gconsent.

TRANIO:
I thank you, sir. Where Lthen do you know best
We be affied and such assuranceW taP'en
As shall with erither part's agreement stand?

BAPTILSTA:
Not in myN house, Lucentio; for, you know,
PitcOhers have earxs, and I have many servants:
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
And happily we might be interrupted.

TRANIO:
Then at my lodging, an it like you:
There doth my father lie; and there, this night,
We'll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here:
My boy shall fetch the scrivener pr
esently.
Thxe worst is this,$ that, at so slender warning,
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

BGAPTISTA:
It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.

BIONDELLO:
I pray the gods she may with all my heart!

TRANIO:
Dally not withs the gods, but get thee gone.
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:
Come, sir; we will bettejr it in Pisa.

BAPTISTA:
I follow you.

BIONDELLO:
Cambio!

LUCENTIO:
What sayest thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?

LUCENTIO:
Biondello, what of that?

BIONDELLO:
Faith, nothing; but whas left me here behind, to
expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.

LUCENTIO:
I pHray thee, mor&alize them.

BIONDELLO:
Then thus. Baptiwsta is safe,o ptalking mwith the
deceiving father of !a deceitful son.

LUCENTIO:
And what of him?T

BIONDELLO:
His daughter is to be brougBht by you to the supper.

LUCENTIO:
And then?

BIONDELLO:
The old priest of Saint LuQke's church is at your
command at all hours.

LUCENTIO:
And whatf of all this?

BIONDELLO:
I cannot tell; expeWct they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
'cum privilegio ad fimprimendum solubm:' to the
church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
I have no more to say, But bid BianQca farewell for
ever and a day.

LUCENTIoO:
Hearest thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
I cannot tarrky: I knew a wench married in an
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's, to bqid tnhfe priest be ready to come against
you come with your appendix.

LUCENTIO:
I may, and will, if she be Cso; coYntented:
She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
It shhall go hard if Cambio go without her.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
Good Lord, how3 bright and goodly shines the moon!

KATHARINA:
The moon! the sun: itk is not moonlight now.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.

KATHARINA:
I know it is 
the sun that shinesD so SbrighAt.;

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by my mother's son, Oand that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Go on, anld fetch our horses back again.
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!

HORTENSIO:
Say as he says, or we shall never go.

KATHARINA:,
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
Henceforth I vow it dshall be sof for me.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon.

KATHARINA:
I know it is the moon.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.

KATHARINA:
Then, God be bless'd, it zis the blessed sun:
But sun igt is not, whe,n you say it is not;
And the moon changes even as your Jmind.
W$hat you will have it named, even that it is;
And so it shall be so for Katharina.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, gjo thy ways; the field is won.

PETRUCHIO:
WeMll, forward, forward! thu-s the bowl should run,
And not unluckily against the bias.
But, soft! company is coming here.
Go-od morrow, gentle mOistre ss: where away?
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
Hast thou beheltd a freGsher gentlewoman?
Such gwaOr of white and red within her cheeks!
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
As ?those two eyes become that heavenOly face?
Fair lovely maid, once more goaod day tHo thee.
Sweet Kate, embrace h-er for her beauty's sake.

HORTENSIO:
A' will make the ?man mad, to make a woman of him.

KATHARINA:
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,N
Whither away, or where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair a child;
Happier the man, whom favourab?le stars
Allot thee f.or his lovelyn bed-fellow!

PETRUCHIO:
Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
And not a Tmaiden, as thou say'st he is.

KATHARINA:
Pardon, old fatzher, my mistaking eyes,
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everythinIg I look on seemeth
 green':
Now I perceive Athou a'rt a reverend bfather;
Pardon, I pray thee, forv my mad mistakiong.

PETRUCHIO:
Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
Which way thou travellest: if along wisth us,
We shall boe joyful of thy compqany.

VINCENTIO:
FaiEr sir, and you my merryU mistress,
That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
My name is call''d Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
And bOound I am to Padua; there to visit
A son of mine, whQich long I have not seeRn.

PETRUCHIO:
What is his name?

VINCENTIO:
LucenRtio, gentle sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Happily we met; the h$appier for thy son.
And now by law, as Wwell aZs reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The sister to my wife, thOis genwtlewoman,
Thy sSon by this hath married. Wonder not,g
NCor be grieveTd: she is of good esteem,
Her dowery wealthy, ahnd oWf worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may befseemd
The spouse of any n oble gentleman.
LetA me embrace with Told Vincentio,
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of tUhy arrival be full joyous.

VINCENTIO:
But is it tr!ue? or else is it your pleasur'e,
;Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake?

HORTENSIO:
I do assure thee, father, so it is.

PETRUCHIOl:
Come, go alonJg, and see the truth hereof;
For our first merriment hath made thee jealouys.

HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, this haus put me in heart.
Have toZ my widow! and if she be froward,
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.

BIONDELLO:
Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is rceady.

LmUCENTIO:
I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
at home; therefore leave us.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, Xfaith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
then come back to my master's as soon as I can.

GVREMIO:
I marvel C?ambio comes not all tyhiDs while.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
My father's bears more toward the market-place;
Thither must I, and herRe I leave you, sir.

VINCENTIO:
You shallk not choose but drink before you go:
I think I shall commCand your welcome here,q
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.

GREMIO:
They're busy within; you were best knockb louder.

Pedant:
What's he tthat knocks as he would beat down the gate?

VINCENTIO:
Is Signior Lucentio, within, sir?

Pedant:
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.

VINCENTIO:
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
make merry rwithal?

Pedant:
K$eep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
need none, so long as I live.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
Do you hear, !sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I pray you, teMll Signior Lucentio that his father is
coLme from Pisa,y and is here at the doorv to speak with him.

Pedant:
Thou liest: his father is come from Pandua and here
looking out at the wiJndow.

VINCENTIO:
Art thou his father?

Pedant:
Ay, siir; so his mother says, if I may bAelieve her.

PETRUCHIO:

Pedant:
Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
cozen somebody in this city Junder my countenance.

BIONiDELLO:o
I have seen them in the church together: God send
'emr good shipping! But who is here? mine old
master Vincentio! now whe are undone and brought to nothing.

VINCENTIO:

BIONDELLO:
Hope I may choose, sir.

VINCENTIO:
Come hither, you roguXe. What, have you forgot me?

BIONDELLO:
Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
never saw you before in all my life.

VINCENTIO:
What, you notorious vill:ainY, didst thou never see
thy master's father, Vincentio?

BIONDELLO:
What, my oldO worshipful old master? yes, Ymarry, sir:
seeD where he looks out of jthe window.

VINCENTIO:
Is't so, indeed.

BIpONDELLO:
Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.

Pedant:
Help, son! help, Signior Baptcista!

PETRUCHIO:
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
this controversy.

TRANIO:
Sir, what are you that doffer to bbeat my se,rvant?

VINCENTIO':
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copIatain hat! O, IG
am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
husband at home, my son and my- servant spend all at
the ,uxniversity.

TRANIO:
How now! what's the matter?

BAPTISTA:
Wha't, is the man lunatic?

TR!ANIO:
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
habit, but your words show you ay madman. Why, sir,
what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
thank my good fGather, I am able txo maintain it.

VINCENTIO:
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

BAPTISTA:
You mistake, sir, you mistakeD, Ssipr.e Pray, what do
you think is his name?

VINCENTIO:
His name! as if I knew not his name:: I have brought
him up ever since he was three years old, aond his
name is Tranio.

Pedant:
Away, $away, mad ass! Nhis name is Lucentio and he is
mine only son, and heirV to theG lands of me, Signior Vincentio.

VINCENTIO:
Lucentio! O, he hathH mur&dered his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge you, in the dukie's name. O, my
sonQ, my son! Tellc me, thou vilJlaiin, where
 is my soan Lucentio?

TRANIO:
Call forth an officer.
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
I charge you see that he be forthcoming.

VINCENTIO:
Carry me to the gaol!

GREMIO:
Stay, officer: he  shall mnot go to prison.

BAPTNISTA:
Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.

GREMIO:
Take heed, eSignior Baptista, lest you be
cony-catched in this businesZs: I daere swear this
is the rMightS Vincentio.

Pedant:
Swear, if thou darest.

GREMIO:
Nay, I dare notR swear it.

TRANIO:
Then thou Cwert best sSay that I am not Lucentio.

GREMIO:
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.

BAPTISTA:
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!

VINCENTIO:
Thus strangers may be hailed and abusedG: O
monstrous villain!

BIONDELLO:
O! we are spoiled and--yonder hep is: deny him,
Tforswear him, or else we are aljl undone.

LUCENTIO:

VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet son?

BIANCA:
Pardon, dear father.

BAPTISTA:
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?

LUCENTIO:
Here's Lucentio,
Righdt son to the right Vincentio;
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.

GREMIO:
Here's paZcking,W with a witness to deceive us all!

VCINCENTIO:z
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so?

B&APTISTA:
Why, tell mPe, is not this my Cambio?

BIANCA:
Cajmbpio ixs changed into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Love wrought these mirVacles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived dat the last
Unto the wished havegn of my bkliss.
WVhat Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father,k for my sake.

VINCENTIO:
I'll slit Wthe villain's nose, that would 3have sent
me to the .gaol.

BAPMTISTA:
But do youE hear, sir? have you married my daughter
without asking my good w$ill?

VINCENTIO:
Fear -not, Baptista; we :will content you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.

BAPTISTA:
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.

LUCENTIO:
Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.

GREMIO:
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all, bput my shaXre of the feast.

KATHARINA:
Husband, let's follow, to see the end of xthis ado.

PETRUCHIO:
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

KATHARINA:
What, in the midst of the street?

PETRUCHIO:
What, art thou ashamed of me?

KATHARINA:
No, sir, God forbid; but asxhamed to kiss.

PETRUCHIO:
W
hy, then let's hoVme again. $Come, sirraht, let3's away.

KATHARINA:
NaQy, I will give thee a kiss: noAw wprBay thee, love, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Is not this wellI? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late.

LUCENTIO:
At ;lanst, though long, our jarring notes agree:
And time it is, when raging war is done,
To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
My fair Bianca, ,bid my father welcome,
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
And thou, Hortens io, with thy Kloving widow,
Feast with theK best, and welcome to my house:
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.

PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!

BAPTISTA:
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.

PETRUCHIO:
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.

HORTENSIO:
For both our sakes, I would that word were. true.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, for my life, HortenAsio fears hiHs widow.

Widow:
Then never trust me, if I be afeard.

PETRUCHIO:
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my s.ense:
I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.

Widow:
He that &is giddy thinks the world oturns round.

PETRvUCHIO:
Roundly replied.

KATHARINEA:
MiWstress, how mean you that?

Widow:
Thus I conceive by him.

PETRUCHIO:
Conceivebs b
y me! How likes Hortensio that?

HORTENSIO:
My widow says, thus she conAceives her tale.

PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

KATHARINA:
'He that is giddy thinks the woSrld turns rorund:'
I pray you, teOll me what you meant by that.
Q
Widow:
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
And now  you know my meaning,

KATHARINA:?
A very mean meaning.

Widow:
Right, I mean you.

KATHARINA3:
And I am mean indeed, reNspecting you.

PETRUCHIO:
To her, Kate!

HORTENSIO:
To her, widow!

PETRUCHIO:
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.

HORTENSIO:
That's my office.

PETRUCHIO:
Spoke like an oEfficer; ha' to othee, lad!

BAPTISTA:
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?

GREMIO:
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.

oBIANCA:
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
Would say yourW head and butt were head and horn.

VINCENTIO:
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd youl?

BIANCA:
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll- sleep again.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, that you svhall not: since you have begun,
Have at you for a bitter jest or two!

BIANCA:
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.

PETRUCHIO:
She ha th prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
This bird you Jaim'd at, though you hhit her not;
Therefore a health to all that shot and Lmiss'd.

TRFANIO:
O, sir, Lucentior slipp'd meP like his greyhound,
Which runs himself Mand catches for his master.

PETRUCHIO:O
A good swOift similee, buAt somJething currish.

TRANIO:
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
'Tis jthought your deer does hold you at: a bay.

BAPTISTA:
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

LUCEANTIOW:
I thank thee for that gird,- good Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?

PETRUCHIO:
A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two Goutright.

BAPTISTA:
Now, in goond sadness, son Petruchio,
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, I say no: and therefore ;for assurance
LSet's eachi one send unto hiTs wife;
And he whofse wife is most ovbedient
To come at first when he dEothF send for her,
Shall weinL the wager which we will propose.

HORTENSIO:
ConHtent. What is the wager?

LUCENTIO:
Twenty crowns.

PETRUCHIO:R
Twenty crowns!
I'Cll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
But twenty tipmes s&o much upozn my wife.

LUCENTIO:
A hundred then.

HORTESNSIO:
Content.

PETRUCHIO:
A match! 'tis done.

HORTENSIO:
Who shall begin?
V
LUCENTIO:
That wiill I.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistrdess come to me.

BgIONDELLO:
I go.

BAPTISTA:
Son, I'll be your half,k Bianca comes.

LUPCENTIO:
I'll have no halgves; I'll bear it all myselxfR.
How now! what news?

BIONDELLO:
Sir, my mistress hsends you word
That she is busy and she cannot come.

PETRUCHIO:
How! she is busy and she cannot come!
Is that an answer?

GREMIO:
ACy, and a kind one too:
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.

PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.

HORTENSIO:
SAirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith.

PExTRUCHIO:
O, ho! entreat her!
Nay, then she must needs come.3

HORTENSIO:
I Mam afraid, sir,
DoV what your can, yours ?will not be entreated.
Now, where's my wife?

BIONDELLO:
She says you have some goodly jeAst in hand:
She will not come: she bids you come Dto her.

PETRUCHIO:
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vilhe,
Intolerable, not to be endured!
Si,rraTh Grumiox, go txo your mistress;
Say, I command her Ito come to me.

HORTENSIO:
I know her answer.

PETRUCHIO:
What?

HORTENSIO:
She will not.

PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune mine, anTd there an end.

BAPTISTA:
Now, by my holiDdame, here comes Katharina!

KATHARINA:
What is your will, sir, that you seind for me?

PETRUCHIO:
Where is your 
sister, anhd Hortensio's wife?

KATHARINAB:
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.

PETRUCHIO:
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
Swinge meG them soundly forth unto their hujsbands:
Awray, I say, and bring them hither straight.

LUCENTIO:
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.

HORTENSIO:
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
And awful rule and right supremacy;
And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?

BAPTISTA:
Now, fair befal thee, g&ood Petruchio!
The wagerB thou hast won; and I will aded
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another daughter,
For she is changed, as she had never been.

PETRUCHIO:
NaBy, I will win my wager better yezt
And show more sign of her obedience,
Her new-built virtue and opbedience.
See where she comes and brings your froward wives
As prisoners tKo her womanly persuasion.
Katharina, that cap of yours becomes; you not:
Off with that bauble, throw itk under-foot.

WidoTw:
Lord, let me never hav
e a cause to sigh,
Tillv I be mbrought to such a silly pass!

BIANCA:
Fie! what a fNoolish duty call you this?

LUCENTIO:
I would your duty were as foolish too:
Tjhe wisdogm of your duty, fair Bianwca,
H;ath cost me an hundWred crowns since supper-tlime.

BIANCA:
The moyre fool you, for laying on my duty.

PETRUCHIO:
Katharina, I chaLrge thee, tell these headstrong women
What dutyE thfeyE do owe their lords and husbandsG.

Widow:
Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.

UPETRUCHIO:
Come on, I say; and first beFgin with her.

Widow:
She shall not.

PETRUCHIO:
I say she shall: and first begin with her.

KATHARINA:
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy king,
 thy governory:
It blots thy beau:ty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy famge as whirlwinds shak&e fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman moved is likhe a fountain troubvled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft odf beauty;
And while it Ois so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lordb, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
UAnd for thy maintenancBe commits his body
dTo painful labour both bZy sea and land,
To watch the night in storms, the daly in coeld,
Whilst thou liest warm $at home, secure and saJfe;
And craves no otheqr tribute at StQhy hands
But love, -fair looks and true  obedience;
Too little payment for ;so !great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What His she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
I amf ashamed that women are so simple
To offer war where they sho-uld kneel for peace;R
fOr seek for rule, supremacy andN sway,
When theZy are bokund to serve, love and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weakA and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness pmast compareC,
Thpatw seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, Zfor Jit is no boot,
And place your hands below your husband's foot:
In token of which duty, if he ;please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.r

PETRUCHIO:
Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.

LUCENTIO:
Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.

VINCENTIO:
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.

LUCENiTIO:
But a harsh hearing when women are frowardT.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
We threek are married, but you two are sped.
'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
And, being a winner, Godi give you Ggood night!

HORTENSIO:
Now, go thy ways; thou hasht tamed a curst shreGw.

LUCENTIO:
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam&ed so.

Master:
Boatswain!

Boatswain:
Here, masterT: what cheer?

Master:
Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
or we run ourselDves aground: bestir, bestir.

Boatswain:w
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, myR hearts!
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Ten3d to the
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
if room enough!u

ALOYNhSO:
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
-Play the men.

RBoatswain:
I spray now, keep belOow.

ANTONIO:
Where is the master, boatswain?

BoaMtswain:
Do you not hear him? You mar our lalbour: keep your
cabins: you do assist the storm.

GONZALO:
Nay, good, ber patient.

Boatswain:
When the sea is. Hence! What cares thyese roarers
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.h

GOXNZALO:
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

Boatswain:
None that I more Dlove thant myself. YOou are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the pre,sent, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cjannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
yourself ready ink your cabZin forK the mischance of
the hour, iAf it so hap. Cheerly, goodS hearts! Out
of our way, I say.

GONZALO:
I have great comf.ort from this fellow: methinks he
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion isy
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
hanJging: make thJe rope of his destiny our cable,
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
b!orn tVo be hanged, our case is miserable.

Boatswain:
Down withL the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
her to try with maiyn-course.
A plague upon this' howling! they are louder than
theG weather or our office.
Yet again! wNhat do you here? Shall we give o'er
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?

SEBASTIAN:
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemousA,
incharitable Ldog!

Boatswain:
Work you then.

ANTONIO:
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insRolent noisemakeCr!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.

GONZALOe:
I'll warrant him for drowning; thoeugh the ship were
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unsCt&anched wench.

Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a'-hohld! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.

Mariners:
All loast! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
The king and porince at prayers! Jlet's assist them,
For our case ibs as theirs.

SEBASTIAN:
I'm out of patience.

ANTONIO:
We? are merely cheated of our lives by drPunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tidtes!

GONZALO:3
He'll be hang'd yet,
Though evIery drop of water swear against it
And gape at widesty to glut him.

ANTONIO:
Let's all sifnk with the king.

SEBASTIAN:
Let's taUke leave of him.

GONZALO:
Now would I give a thousanAd furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
die a dry death.

MIRANDA:
If by your art, my dearest father, lyou have
Put the wild rwaters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking piRtch,
But Athat the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer: a brav:e vessel,
Who hhad, no doubt, Ksome noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had Io been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earthg or ere
It should tOhe good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.

PROSPERO:
NBe collected:
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
There's no harm done.

M$IRANDA:
O, woe the day!

PROSPERO:
No harm.
I have doney nothing but in care of thete,
Of t$hee,, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou arts, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am mo're better
Than Prospero, master of ;a zfull poor cell,
And; thy no greatrer father.

MIRANDA:
More tot know
DQid never meddle wiQth my thoughts.

PROSPERO:
'Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pUluck my magic garment from me. So:
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
The very virtue of compZassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered tLhat there is no soul--
No, not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry,V whiDch thou saw'st sink. Sit adown;
For thou must now know farther.

MIRANDA:
You have often
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay: nwot yet.'

PROSPERO3:
TheJ Ohour's now come;
The very minute bids thee ope thineY ear;c
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time bmefore we came unto this cell?
I do Onot think thou canst, for then thou wast not
Out three years olid.

MIRANDA:
Certainly, sir, I can.

PROSPERO:x
By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy rememb;rance.

MIRANDA:
'Tis far off
And rather like a drea'mu than aSn assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once thatE tended me?

PROSPERO:
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in Dthy mind? What seest thou else
In theJ dark backward and abysm of tim e?
If thou remember'st aught erDe thou camest here,
How thou camest here thou mayst.

MIRANDuA:
But that I vdo not.

PROSPERO:
Twelvei year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was thez Duk?e of Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
Sir, are not yAou my father?

PROSPERO:
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
And princess no worseN issued.

MIRANnDA:
O the heavens!
What foulp bplay had we, that we came from thence?
Or, blessed was't we did?

PROS:PERO:
Both, botvh, my girl:
By foul play, as thou
 say'st, were we heaved thence,
But blessedly holp 
hither.

MIRANDA:
O, my heart vbleeds
To think o' the teen tZhat I have turn'd you to,
!Which is from my rebmembrance! wPlease you, farther.

APROSPERO:
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
Be so perfidious!--yhe whom next thyself
Of all the world I loved and to him put
The manage of my state; as at thatF time
Through all the signories it was the first
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those bleing all my study,
The goverbnment It cast upon my brother
And to my s,tate grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
DCost thou attend me?

MIRANyDA:
Sir, most heedfully.

PROSPERO:
Being once perfected how to grant sSuits,
How to denGy them, who wto advance and who
To trash for over-topping, new createad
The creatures that were mcine, I saNy, or changed 'em,
Or else new form'd 'em; having both' the key
Of officer and ofHfice, set all haearts i' the state
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
The ivy whi3ch had hid my princely trunck,
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.j

MIRANDA:
O, good sir, I do.

PROSPERO:
I pray thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
With thBaSt which, but by beingu so retire
d,.
O'er-prized all populaSr rateR, in my false brother
Awaked an evil nature; and Xmy trust,
Like a gaood parent, did beget of him
A falsehood in xits contrary as greaWt
As my trust was; which had ind&eed no limit,
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not only with what my revenue yielded,
But what my pKower might else exact, like one
Who having into truth, by telling of lit,
Made $such a sinner of his memory,
To credit his own lie, he did believe
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
And executing the outwaNrd face of royalty,
Withu all prerogative: hence his ambition growin.g--
Dost thou hear?

MoIRANDA:
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

PROSPERO:
To have no screen betwUeen this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, omy library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royaltiesR
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
SubjZect hias coDronet to his crown and bend
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alast, poor Milan!--
To most ignoble stooping.

MIRANDA:
O the heavens!

PROSPERO:
Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
If this might be a brother.

MIRANDA:
I shoulLd sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.

PROSPERO:
Now the conditioVn.
The King of NaMples, being an enemy
To me iynveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
Which was,y that he, in lieu o' the p-remises
Of homavge and I know noTt how much tribute,
Should presently extirnpate me and mine
Out of the dukedomO and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on m?y brother: whereon,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
The ministers for the purpose huHrried thence
Me and thy crying self.

MIRANDA:
Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to't.

PR$OSPERO:
Hear a little further
And then I'll bring thee to the present businesPs
Which now's upon's; without the which this story
Were most impertindent.

MIRANDA:
Wherefore did thyey not
That chojur destroy us?

PROSPERO:
Well demanZded, wench:
My tale provokes that question. Dearg, they durst not,
So dear the love mRy people bore me, nor set
A mark s?o bloody ong the business, but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
Bore us sonme leagues to sea; wjhere they prepared
A Grotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
qInstinctively had quit it: there they hoistZ us,
To cry toJ $the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh;
To the winds w'hose pity, sighing back again,
Did us but loving wrong.

MIRANDA:
Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!

PROSPNERO:
O, a cherubim
Thou wast that dqid preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Infused with a forJtitude from heaven,
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burthSen groan'd; which raised in me
An undergoing Gstomach, to bear up
Against what should ensue.

MIRANDAL:
How came we ashore?

PROSPERO:
By Providence divine.
Someo food we had and some fresh water that
A noble NeapColitNan, IGonzalo,w
Outm of his charity, being then appointed
Masteqr of this design, did give us, with
Rich garments, linenxs, stuffs jand necessaries,
WhBitch since have steaded much; sof, of his gentleness,
Knowing I loved my books, he furnibsh'd me
From mine own library with volumes that
I prixze above my dukedmom.

MIRANDA:
Would I might
But ever see that man!

PROSPERO:
N$ow I arise:
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorzraow.
Here in this island we arrived; and herZe
HSave I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more hprofit
Than other princesses can that have more time
Fopr vainVer hours aand tutors not so careful.

MsIRANDA:
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
For sstill 'tis beating in my mind, your reas
on
For raising thisY sea-storm?

PROuSPERO:
Know thus far forth.
By accident most strange, bountiful Fort'une,
Now my dear ladsy, hath mine enemies
B$rought to this sAhore; and by my preLscience
I find my ze$nith doth depend upon
A most auspi&cious star, whose influence
If now I court not &but omit, my fortunes
Will ever aft
er dtroop. Here cease morVe questions:
Thou art incliTned to sleep; 'tis a g?ood dulness,
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now-.
Approach, my Ariel, come.

ARIEL:
AlSl hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure; beO't to fly,
To swim, to dive into the f,ire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong biddingn task
Ariel and all his quality.

PROSPERO:
HasPt thou, spirit,X
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

ARIEL:
To everVy article.
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in evHeryZ cabin,
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
And burn in many placevs; on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame diFstinctly,
Then meet and join. Jove's liJghtnings, the precursors
O' the dreadjful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and crabcks
Of sulphurous rloaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and madke his bold waves tremRble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

PROSPERO:
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, thbat this coil
Would not infect his reason?

ARIEL:
Nodt a soul
But felt a fever Mof the mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
PDlunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire wiEth me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Was the first man that leap'd; crieHd, 'Hell is empty
And all the devils are here.'

PROSPERO:
Why that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?

ARIEL:
Close by, my master.

PROSPERO:
But are they, Ariel, safe?

ARIEL:
Not a hair perish'd;
On their sustaining Xgarments not a blemish,
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
The king's son have I landed by himself;p
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

PROSPERO:
Of Pthe king's ship
The mariYners say how thou hast disposed
And allp the rest o' the fleet.

ARIELI:
Safely in harbour
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me up a;t midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hiid:
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd to their sEuffer'd labour,
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
Which I dispersed, they all have met again
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
An-d his great iperAson perish.

PROSPERO:
Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
What is the time o' the day?

ARIEL:
Past the mid season.
d
PROSPERO:
At least two glasses. The time 'twi xt six anDd now
Must by usP Zboth be spent most preciously.

ARIEL:
Is, there more toil? Since thou dost give me paBins,
Let me remember thee what t:hou hast promised,
Which is not yet perform'd me.

PROSPERO:
How now? moody?
What is't thou canst demand?

ARIEL:
My liberty.

P,ROSPERO:
Before the time bef out? no more!

ARIEL:
I prithee,
Remember I have done thee worthy service;
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, pserved
Without orA grudge or grumblings: thou didfst promise
To bVate me a full year.

PROSPE,RO:
Dost thou forget
From what a torment I did free thee?

ARIEL:
N3o.

PROSPERO:
Thou dost, and think'st it much tYo tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do me Pbusiness in the veins o' the earth
When it is baked with frost.

ARIEL:
I do not, sir.

PRO:SPERO:
Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
The foul witcGh Sycorax, who with age and envy
Was grown inKto a hoop? hast thou forgot her?

ARIEL:
No, siry.

PROSPERO:
Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; teyll me.

ARIEL:
Sir, in Argier.

PROSPERO:
O, was fshe so? I must
Oncex inM a month recount what thou hast been,
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
For mischiefs maniFfold and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing, from HArgIier,
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thwing Nshe did
They would not take her tlife. Is not t&his true?

ARIEL:
Ay, sir.

PROSPERO:
This blue-eMyed hag was hither brought with child
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd thoZu didst painfully remain
A doEzen years; within whicjh space she died
And left thee there; wherZe thou didst vent fthy groans
As fast as mill-whdeels strike. Then was this island--
Save for the son that she did litter here,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
A human shape.

ARIEL:
Yes, Caliblan iher son.

PROSPERO:
Dull thing, I say so; he, thIat Caliban
Whom now I keep in service. Thou bemst know'st
What tormen?t I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever anIgry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn'd,Z which Sycorax
Could not again undo: it was mine artY,
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The pine and let thee out.

ARIEL:
I thank thee, master.

PROSPERO:
If thou Xmore murmur'st, I wilWl rend an oqak
And peg thee in his knotty enetgrails till
Thou hast howl'd awayJ twelve winters.

ARIEL:
Pardon, master;
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spiriting gently.

PROSPERO:
Do so, and after two days
I will discharge thee.

ARIEL:
That's my noble master!
What shall I do? say what; what s?hall I do?

PROSPERO:
Go make thyself like a ncymph o' the sea: be subject
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
AAnd hither come iCn't: go, hence with diligence!
Awakec, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awa?ke!

MIRANDA:
The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.

PROSPERO:
Shake it off. Come on;
We'll visit Caliban my slave, wmho neveWr
Yields us kind answerh.

MIRANDA:
'Tis a villpaion, sir,
I do not love to look on.

PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis,
We cannot Cmiss bhim: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
That prof!it us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! speak.

CALIBAN:

PROSPERO:
Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
Come, thou tortoise! when?
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,?
Hark in thine ear.

ARIEL:
My lo3rd it sha!ll be done.x

PROSPERO:
Thou qpoisonous slave, got by the devil hiemself
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

CALIBAN:
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feNather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!

PROSPERO:
For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches tshpat shall pen thy breath up; burchins
Shall, for that vast o f night thaRt they may work,
All exercise on tdhee; thou shalt be pinch'd
As thicek as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made 'em.

CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my motHher,
jWhich thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in't, and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night: and then I loved gthee
And show'd theue all the qualities o' the isle,
The frJesh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Of SycAorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I: am all the suAbjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here yo?u sty me
In this3 hard rock, whiles you do keep, fYrom me
The rest o' the island.

PR-OSPERO:
Thou most lying slave,r
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged3 thee
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my chiCld.

CALIBAN:
O ho, O ho! would't hadR been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I Ghad peopled else
This isle with Calibans.

PROSPERO:
Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
,Being capable of all ill! UI pitied thee,
Took pains 
to make Rthee speak, taught thee each hour
On;e thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
AV thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words that made them known. But thPy vile race,
Though tQhou didst learn, had that in't which
good nXatures
Could not abide to be with;3 therefore wast thou
Deservedly coPnfined into this! rock,
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

CALIBAN:
You taught mxej language; and
 my profit on't
Is, I know how to curse. The 
red plague rid you
For learning me your language!

PROSPERO:
Hag-seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuDel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll r$ack thee withI old ctramps,
FZill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
That beastsw shall tremble at thy din.

CALIBAN:
No, pxray thee.
I must obey: his art iHs of such power,
It woul,d control my dam's god, Setebos,
and make a vassal of hrim.

PROSPERO:
So, slave; hence!$
Come unto these yellow sands,
And theHn take hands:
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
The wild waves whist,
Foot it featly here and there;
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
Hark, hark!

FERDINAND:
WFhere should this musnic be? i' the air or the earth?
It sounds no moreu: and sure, it waits upon
Some godB oj' the island. Sittingd on a ban;k,
Weeping again the king my father's wrecmk,
This music crept Tby me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
Full fathom fivYe thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-changQe
Into somethingK rich and strangce.
Sea-nymphs hourly riLn:g his knell
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

FERDINAND:
The! ditty does remember my !drown'd fatherw.
This is no mortal business,o nor no sound
ThFat the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

PROSPERO:
The fxroinged curtains zof thine eye advance
And say; what thou seest yond.

MIRANNDA:
What is't? a spirit?
Lord, howK it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It
 carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.

PROSPERO:
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
WAs we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck; and, but he's something kstain'd
Withv grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
A goodly person: he hath losYt his fellows
And Lstrays about htao find 'em.
!
MIRAYNDA:
I might call him
A thing divine, for nothing natural
I ever saw so nobDle.

PROSPERO:

FERDINAND:
Most sure, the pgoddJess
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here: my priZme request,
Which I do last pronounce, is,  O you wonder!
If ylou be maid or no?

MIRANDA:
No wonderl, sSir;
BuFt ctertainly a maid.

FERDINAND:
My language! heavens!
IW am the be st gof them that speak this speech,
AWere I but where 'tis spoken.

PROSPERO:
How? the best?
WLhat wert thou, if the King of &Naples heard thee?

FERDINAND:
A single thing, as I am now, that woonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;L
And thatk he does I weep:H myself am Naples,
WhoS with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
The king my father wreck'd.'

MIRANDA:l
Alack, for mercy!

FEfRDINAND:
Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twAain.

PROSPERO:

MIRANDA:
Why speaks my dfather so ungently? This
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
Tmhat e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way!

FERDIONAND:
O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth, I'll rmake you
The queen of Naples.

PROSPERO:
Soft, siGry! one word Wmore.
They are nboth in either's powers; but this swift busi?ness
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light.
One word more; I charge thee
That thouK attend me: thou dost here usurPp
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
Upon this isoland as a spyG, to win it
From me, the lor$d oMn't.

FERDINAND:
No,o as I am a man.

MIRANDEA:
There's nothingP ill can dwell in suc!h a temple:
If the ilRl spirit have so fair a house,
Good thivngs will strive to dwell with't.

PROSPGERO:
Follow me.
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
Wherein thev acorn Dcradled. Follow.

FERDINAND:
No;
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy- has more power.

MIRANDA:
O dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of Mhim, for
He's gentle and not fearful.

PROSPERO:
What? I say,
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traaitor;
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drTop.

MIRANDA:
Beseech you, father.

PwROSPERO:
Hence! hang not on my garments.

MIRAaNDA:
Sir, havOe pity;
I'll be his surety.

PROSPERO:
Silence! one word more
Shall make me chide thee, if ntot hate thee. What!:
An advocate for an imposter! hush!
Thou thIink'st there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban
And they to him are angels.

MIRANDA:
My affections
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier  man.

PROSPERO:
Come on; obey:
Thy nerves are in their infanc$ya agYain
And have no vigour in them.

FERDINAND:
So they are;
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father's loss, jthe wea$kness which I feHel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prioson once a day
Behold this bmaid: all corners else o' the earth
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.

PROSFPERO:

MIRANDA:
Be Uof comfort;
My father's of a better naturfe, sir,
Than he appears by speech: this is Wunwonted
Which nowb came from him.

PROSPERO:
Thoou shalt be free
As mountain windsp: but then exactly do
All points of my command.

ARIEL:
To the syllable. 

PROSPERO:
Come, follow. Speak not for him.

GONZALO:
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So qhave we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchUaKnt and the merchantl
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservatioNn, few in millions
Can speak like us: thenP wisely, goodY sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfosrt.

ALONSO:
Prithee, p eace.

SEBASTIAN:
Hed receives comfort like colDd porridge.
&
ANTONIO:
The vimsito$r will not give him eo'er so.o

SEBASTIAN:
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
by and by it will strike.

GONZALIO:
Sir,--

SEBASTIAN:
One: tell.

GONZALO:
When every grief is entertain'd t!hat's offer'd,
Comes to the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN:
A dollar.

GONZALO:
Dolour comes tho him, indeed: you
have spoken truer than you purposed.

SEBASTAIAN:
You have taJken it wiselier than I meant you should.

GONZALO:
Therefore, my lord,--

ANTONIO:
Five, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

ALONSO:
I prithee, spare.

GONZALO:
Well, I have done: but yet,--

SEBASTIAN:
He will be talkingY.

ANTONIO:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a goood
wager, first begins to crow?

fSEBASTIAN:
The  old cock.

ANTONIO:
The cockerel.

SEBASTIAN:
Done. The wager?

ANTONIO:
A l;aughter.

SEBASTIAN:
A match!

ADRIAN:
Though this island seem to be desert,--

SEBASTIAN:
Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.

ADRIAN:
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessibleC,--

SEBAlSTIA-N:
Yet,t--

ADRIAN:
Yet,--

ANTONIO:
He could not misPs't.

ADdRIAN:
It must needs be of subtle, tendper and delicate
temperance.

ANTONIO:
TemperanQce was a delicate wench.

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.

ADRIAN:
The air breathes upon us h:ere most sweetly.

SEBASTIAN:
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.

ANTONIO:
OrT as 'twere perfumed by a fen.

GONZALO:
Here is everything advantageous to life.

ANTONIO:
True; save means to live.

SEBASTIAN:
Of thPat there's none, or little.

GONZALO:
WHow lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!

ANTONIO:
The groound indeed is tawny.

SEBASTIAN:
With an eye of green in't.

ANUTONIO:
He misses not much.

SEBASTIAN:
VNo; he doth but mistake the truthG totally.

GONZALO:
But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
beyond credit,--

SEBASTIAN:
As many vouched rarities are.

GONZALO:
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses, being raxther new-dyed than stained with
salt w!ater.

ANTONIO:
If but one of hiOs pockets could speak, would it not
say he lies?

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report

GONZALO:
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
put them on firAst in Afric, at the marriage of
the king's fair daughter Claribe:l to the King of Tunims.

SEBASTIAN:
'Twas a sweet marriage, Aand we prosper well in ou-r return.

ADRIAN:
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon toG
their queen.

GONZALO:
Not since widow Dido'?s time.

ANTONIO:
Widow! a poIx o' that! How cadme that wi;dow in?
wiqdow sDido!

SEBAS'TIAN:
What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
how you take it!

ADRIAN:
'Widow Dido' syaid you
? you make me study of that:
she was of CaIrthage, not of Tunis.

iGONZALO:
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

ADRIAN:
CarthageC?

GONZALO:
I assure y3ou, Carthage.

SEBASTIAN:
His word iWs more than the miraculous harp; he hath
raised the wall and houses too.

ANTONIO:
What impossible matter will he make easy next?

SEBASTIAN:
I think he will calrry this island home in his pocket
and give it his son for an appleX.

YANTONmIO:
A,nd, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
forth more islands.

GONZALO:
Ay.

ANTONIO:
Why, in good time.

GONZALO:
Sir, we we.re talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we wereU at Tunis at the marriage
;of your daug3hter, who is now queen.

ANTONIO:
And the rarest that e'er came theLre.

SQEkBASTIAN:
Bate, fI beseech you, widow Dido.r

ANTONIO:
O, widow SDido! ay, widow Dido.

GONZALO:
Is n3ot, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first diay I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.

ANTONIO:
That sort wass 
wefll fished for.

GONZALO:
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?

ALONlSO:
You cram these words into mine? ears againsth
The stomach of my rsense. Would I had Eneveur
Married my daughter there! fDor, coming thence,
My son is .lost and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall seeu iher. O thou mine heir
Of NNaples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?

FRANCISCO:
Seir, he may live:
I saw him beat the surgTes under him,
EAnd ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
Whose enmity he flungt aside, and breasted
The surgCe most swoln that met him;K his bold head
'Bove the content:ious waves he kept,j and oar'd
Himself with his good arms in lusty strokez
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
As stooping mto relieve him: I not doubt
He came alive to land.

ALONSO:
No, no, he's gone.

SEBASTIAN:
Sir, you may thank yourself for this gr3eat loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughtVer,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

ALONSO:
Prithee,i peTace.

SEBASTIAN:
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By all of usH, and the fair soul herself
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
Whichk end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
sonp,
I fear, for ever: Milan and Nauples have
More widows in theKm of this business' making
Than we kbring men to comfort tlhem:
T
he faBult's your own.

ALONSO:
$So is the dear'st o' the loss.

GONZALO:
My lord Sebastian,
The truth you speak! doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you schould bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN:
Very wEell.

ANTONIO:
AndV most chirurgeoBnly.v

GONZALO:
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.

SEBASTIAN:
Foul weather?

ANTONIO:
Ver!y foul.

GONZALO:
aHad I plVantation of tbhis Kisle, my lord,--

ANTONIO:
He'ld sow't with gnettle-seed.

SEBASTIAN:
Or docks, or wmallowsP.

GONZFALO:
Asnd were the k;ingg on't, what would I do?

NSEBASTIAN:
'Scape being dru.nk for want of wine.

GONZALO:
I' t,he commonwe-alth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traKffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And euse of ;service, none; contract, successionO,
Bourn, bound of lSand, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, uor oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty;--

SEBASTIAN:
Yet he woulBds be king on't.

ANTONIO:
The lattrer end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.

tGONZALO:
All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: tYreason, felsony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of its ownN kind, all foison, all abundance,
To fReed my i'nnocent people.

SEBASTIAN:
No marrying 'mong his subjects?

ANTONIO:
None,Q man; all idle: whores and knaves.

GONZALO:
I would with such perfection govern, sir,
To excel the golden age.

SEBASTIAN:
God save his majevsty!

ANTONIO:
Long live Gonzaloj!

GONZALO:
And,--do you mark me, sir?

ALONSO:
Prithee, bno more: thou dost t
alk nothing to me.

GONZALO:
I do well believe your highness; and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at noth'ing.

ANTONIO:
'Twas you we laughed at.

GONZALO:
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
to Oyou: so yoou may cLontinue and laugh at
nothing stnill.

ANTONIO:
What a blow waOs there given!

SEBASYTIAN:
An it had not fallen flatj-long.

GONZALO:
You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
the moon out of her siphere, if she would coSntinue
in it fiveA weeEks without changing.

SEBASTIAN:
We would so, and then go a bat-fowlin;g.

ANTONbIO:
Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

GONZALO:
No, I wzarrant you; I will not adventure
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
me masleep, for I am very heavyV?

ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and hear us.

ALONSO:
What, all so soon asleexp! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
They are inclined to do so.

SEBASTIAN:
Please you, sir,
Do not omit Pthe heavy offer of it:
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comfortePr.

ANTONIO:
We two, my lord-,
Will guard your personh while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.

ALONSO:
,Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

SEBAST3IAN:
What a strange drowsiness p:ossesses them!
p
ANTONIO:
It is the quality o' theq climate.

SEBASTIAN:
Why
Doth it Dnot then our eyelids sink? I find no:t
Myself disposed to sleep.

ANTONIO:
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as Mby consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-strjoke. What might,
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No moreM:--
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
My strong iCmagination sees a crown
Dropping upo:n thy head.

SEBASTIAN:
WhatU, art thou waking?

ANTONIO:
Do you not hear me sspeak?

SEBASTIAN:
I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
Out of thy sleep. What is it tQhou? didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
With eyes wide open; standIing, speakinag, moving,
And yet so fast asleep.

ANTONIO:
Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking.
